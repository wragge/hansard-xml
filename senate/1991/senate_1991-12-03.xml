<PARA>Mr President, it has happened again. The Government has shown no courtesy; it gave no advice to the Opposition of what it intended to do; and it has given no reason. Last night, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) came in and, with the support of the Australian Democrats, extended the period of the sitting of the Senate until 19 December. We were told that an extra week was wanted so that the legislative program could be properly dealt with. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this morning, the Government comes in here, no doubt with the support of the Democrats, and seeks to limit debate on what is a fundamental Bill&mdash;a Bill which is embarrassing the Government because its effect is to limit freedom of speech. Now, rather than have the Bill properly debated, rather than have the detail properly considered by the Senate, the Government comes in here and seeks to apply the guillotine, no doubt with the support of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I remind you again, as I did last year, of what the Australian Democrats Whip said on 31 August 1988 when he wrote to the Parliamentary Liaison Officer to put down the position of the Democrats&mdash;the Party that came here to `keep the bastards honest'&mdash;in respect of the guillotine . At the end of the last session, Senator McLean said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Packages of contentious legislation were declared urgent and debate was guillotined with our concurrence. We will not agree to such tactics again.</PARA>
<PARA>On 13 December last year the Democrats came in again, huddling with the Government to provide a guillotine to I think some 54 Bills, and said that special circumstances applied because Christmas was coming. Again, we had to chop debate. The Government comes in today and seeks to apply this guillotine in order that there might not be proper debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the circumstances. The explanatory memorandum for this Bill was delivered to honourable senators this morning, about half an hour before debate was supposed to start. That is the state of preparation of the Government in relation to this legislation. It not only expects it to be debated first thing this morning but also wants to limit the time for debate and consideration by the Senate. When were the Government's amendments put down? Late last night, 37 Government amendments, some of them incomprehensible, were put down by the Government to amend substantially its piece of legislation which it actually wanted to debate last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday morning at the Whips' meeting the Government said that we were going to debate the Bill all of last night if necessary until it was finished. That was before it had even given us the 37 extra Government amendments. The rumour around this place is that there are further amendments still to come. That is the way in which the Government wishes a very serious piece of legislation to be debated. Amendments which fundamentally change the nature of the Bill are dropped on us at the last minute: amendments that we should have the opportunity to consider properly and take to our party room if necessary; and amendments which affect the States, because State elections will be affected by this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is seeking not only to limit advertising for Federal elections but also to limit advertising for State and Territory elections. Is it giving the States and Territories the opportunity to look at the amendments which it put down last night&mdash;for example, the unprecedented `talking head' amendments which will be introduced for the first time?  No, the States and the Territories will have to put up with that because the Government does not want to give them the opportunity to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be given the opportunity to consider it properly. In actual fact, the amendments and the explanatory memorandum that have been put down this morning demonstrate that the amendments should go to a Senate standing committee to be considered and dealt with properly. If it were done in the proper way, the whole Bill would be dealt with more expeditiously. But, instead of doing it properly, the Government wants to curtail debate. It comes in here and wants to apply the guillotine to ensure that proper debate does not take place. It conspires with the Democrats to ensure that proper debate on this important legislation does not take place. So we on this side of the chamber oppose, with all the vigour we can muster, this guillotine. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be realistic. Opposition members have to come in here and say all this because they think it is important that they make a show for the troops and shout and scream, but the fact is that two days of debate will be plenty of time for this Bill. This is the fourth or fifth time we have been around this track in this chamber. To pretend that we need to have another major debate going beyond two days is absolute humbug&mdash;and the Opposition knows it. It is an attempt to come in and whip up a bit of indignation, but from the Government's point of view it is just using up part of those two days. It is the Opposition members' two days. If this is how they choose to use their time, it is up to them. We are prepared to go along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1975 to 1980 the urgency motion was gagged by the then Government, the now Opposition, every time it was moved. Apart from the fact that the coalition whacked through 16 Bills in two hours, it cannot say there is no debate, because we are giving it two days. In the Government's view, after this debate about whether we have a guillotine is concluded, assuming it is carried, the way in which the time available is used will be up to the Opposition. If it is the Opposition's desire to negate the adjournment tonight to continue the debate, we will agree to that. If it does not wish to do so, we will also agree. The sensible agreement we have reached for the MPI today to facilitate debate on this Bill <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>is an example of how intervening business can be dealt with. That has been done in a cooperative manner. </PARA>

This gives us the potential to do that. It is up to the Opposition, because the Government will cooperate with it in whichever way it chooses to play from here. This proposal gives us the potential to finish before 19 December.

Opposition members themselves are taking time out of the debate on what they, by their own definition and protestations, regard as an important Bill. The Opposition has 29 speakers on this Bill. Do Opposition members seriously say that by the time they get to the twentieth speaker they will still have something fresh to say? I very much doubt that they will. Two days for one Bill is more than enough time to fairly and exhaustively deal with every aspect of the legislation. Negotiation has gone on. Senator Hill spoke to me yesterday, and I asked the Government to put off this matter for a further day to give more time for consideration. His argument this morning is a hollow protestation and cannot be taken seriously. </PARA>

As Senator Coulter said, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill was introduced in June and the Government tried to whip it through.

Both the Australian Democrats and the Government refused, first of all, to split the Bill, then they refused to refer it to a committee.

Of course, what happened was that those people reacted. On the evidence given to our own committee, so ably led by Senator Olsen, and to me, everyone was opposed to this Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to say that I am sure there is half an hour of virtuous contribution I could make on this matter but I do not need it and I do not intend to do it. It would be very hard to persuade the Australian people that, on the fourth time the Senate debates this Bill, a two-day debate is not sufficient time. This Bill and its ramifications have been debated in this chamber, in the House of Representatives, in State parliaments and in public. It was introduced into the Senate in March of this year, almost nine months ago. It has been a very long gestation. I do not believe that anybody could think that debate is being inappropriately foreshortened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion has as its characteristic, as Senator Ray said, the capacity to enable an organised, balanced debate rather than one which allows for what I think some people may acknowledge happens from time to time with Opposition senators&mdash;tedious repetition. It is true that if members of the Opposition so choose, they may still be able to have 27 speakers on the second reading debate; the time is available for that. That would then foreshorten the time they had available for the committee stage, but that is their concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not in any way impede their right to negate the adjournment and facilitate an extended second reading debate if that is what they choose. If they wish to shorten the second reading stage and give lengthy attention to individual clauses and use all the time on any one clause, that is a matter that is open to them and with which we will cooperate. All we are doing is saying that tedious repetition is not going to be allowed to endlessly defer the Bill and blow out the whole of the legislative program. Consistent with sensible management, we are going to press on to get this Bill dealt with within two days of debate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue which usually comes up in debate about whether we need a guillotine is whether we allow proper and due consideration of the legislation. That is a criterion that Senator Hill has set down in the past. It seems to me to be one that bears consideration here. It beggars description to say that two days of debate is not proper and due consideration of a Bill that is not being introduced for the first time and the concepts of which are very well known, have been very well debated and extensively considered. Legislation often comes into this Parliament with amendments being considered in the chamber. It happens to be what the Committee of the Whole stage is all about. The Senate has operated, until the last couple of years when we have had this committee stage, in that form for 80-odd years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters considered this Bill four years ago. The recommendations from that Committee were considered by the Government. Legislation from the House of Representative was introduced into this place in March. We had debates in the intervening period; we had public debate at that stage. We debated it for a couple of days in August. We then had another extensive committee stage, at which all members of the public had the opportunity&mdash;many of them took it&mdash;to make their representations. All of the parties and individuals represented in the Senate had an opportunity to participate in the debate of the consideration of the report. We then had an unprecedented situation in which we facilitated a 2 1/2-hour debate on the presentation of that report. There was some criticism along the lines that we should not have allowed that to happen. I believe that it was a generous consideration. It meant that all of the new issues were adequately aired on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have an opportunity to debate this Bill for two days. Members of the Opposition will be able to express their view; Government members will be able to express their view; and the Independents and the Australian Democrats will also be able to express their views. How we deal with this debate from now on is essentially in the hands of the Opposition. The number of hours and the way the time is allocated is a matter on which the Government will cooperate with the Opposition. Moving the motion to allow debate until 7.30 tomorrow evening is far from being an unreasonable restriction of debate. The only criticism that people might have is that we are giving too much time. I have moved the motion confident in the fact that it is both reasonable and necessary. </PARA>

<PARA>It is ironic that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 before the chamber concerns freedom of speech. The Bill is an attempt by the Government to limit freedom of speech in election campaigns, to curtail political parties and individuals from promoting their case before the Australian people. That is what the Bill is all about; that is what the Government wants to do. The Government wants to introduce constraints of this nature which would prohibit parties and individuals from promoting their case through the electronic media. This is not a matter that should go by without full and detailed debate. The Bill fundamentally concerns freedom of speech. It is being condemned by the independent bodies in this country that have the charter to protect such rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Government seeking to do today? It is seeking to limit debate on whether the Bill to impose such further restraints should be carried. It is a double negative: the Government is seeking to limit the freedom of speech of this chamber to debate a piece of legislation which is designed to limit freedom of speech at election time. The Government should be condemned for that. Why does the Government want to limit freedom of speech in this way? We know. It is because it is broke. The Government no longer has the money to pay for advertising. Instead of coming clean on that failure and recognising it, the Government wants to impose a restraint on all Australians, both in the Territories and the States. In all elections&mdash;whether they be Commonwealth, State or Territory&mdash;there will no longer be the option of taking out paid electronic advertising. The ALP has been unable to handle its financial affairs properly and can no longer afford to pay for its advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen this demonstrated in the last few days by the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. It is now some $7m in the red as a result of the incompetent financial planning of the Federal President of the ALP, Senator Stephen Loosley, who was at the time the Secretary of the New South Wales branch. So, instead of coming clean and recognising that the ALP cannot pay for its own advertising, it wants to prohibit all Australians from being able to advertise their particular arguments during an election campaign. It is not surprising, therefore, that we are upset by that. Never before has a government sought to do that to the Australian people&mdash;and we will fight it and continue to fight it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a moment ago from the Australian Democrats.   It was they who said, `We will never be overridden by the Government; we have come into this chamber to ensure fair play'. As I have read to honourable senators, Senator McLean said, `We will never allow the gag; we will not allow it because this is the chamber for debate'. We all know there is no debate at the other end of the building. That is a chamber of the numbers where debate does not take place. But on important issues, fundamental issues, issues concerning freedom of speech, there is one chamber in which the Australian people can be confident that a piece of legislation will be dealt with properly&mdash;and that is this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats say that they will ensure proper debate. But when it comes to the test, as it did last year, they are found wanting. But it is not only last year. What happened in 1983?  The Sex Discrimination Bill was declared an urgent Bill by Senator Grimes; the motion was supported by the Democrats. In October 1984, Senator Button declared 14 Bills to be urgent; the motion was supported by the Democrats. In May 1987, Senator Gareth Evans declared 25 Bills as urgent; the motion was supported by the Democrats. On 24 March 1988, the Conservation Legislation Amendment Bill was declared urgent by Senator Evans; the motion was supported by the Democrats. In June 1988, Senator Evans declared 36 Bills urgent; the motion was supported by the Democrats. Last year&mdash;the one that Senator Ray boasts about because it is the largest number of Bills declared urgent in one motion in the history of this Parliament&mdash;Senator Ray declared 52 Bills to be urgent; the motion was supported by the Democrats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan has just made one of the most hypocritical contributions to this chamber that I have heard since I have been here. It was the ALP that bought more electronic media advertising time and had a greater increase of expenditure on electronic advertising than any other political party in the last Federal election. Senator McMullan talked about buying votes, buying elections and manipulating the electorate. But it was the ALP, in percentage terms, that increased its expenditure in the electronic media more than any other political party. The coalition parties almost maintained their status quo. This was not the case with the ALP which was responsible for a very substantial increase in expenditure. So I say to Senator McMullan: do not come in here with this nonsense about expenditure when we know his Party's track record, when it has debts of some $7m in New South Wales that have been exposed in the past few days.</PARA></TALK.START>

As a result of the recommendations of the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, he comes in here with 37 amendments.

So this legislation was submerged and pushed under the carpet. It was the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Electoral Commission which blew the whistle on the legislation. Let us not forget that in the House of Representatives that night the Government gutted the Bill with its own amendment. It introduced the legislation and then it introduced an amendment to it which, in effect, said that it would, by regulation, set the amount that had to be disclosed and set, by regulation, those organisations in the community which would be exempt from this legislation. So the Government in fact gutted the legislation the night it was introduced in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation then came to the Senate and, as a result of the pressure from the Human Rights Commissioner, the Law Council and the Australian Electoral Commission and as a result of the Australian Democrats leadership tussle, it was referred to the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures. There were no other reasons. Because of the Australian Democrats' leadership tussle, the Government had no idea what was going to happen with the amendments. It had no idea what the Democrats were going to do. So in order to buy time and allow the Democrats to sort out their leadership tussle, the legislation went off to the Select Committee. </PARA>

It is a totally different concept to that introduced back in May.

The transparent disingenuousness of both Senator Olsen and Senator Hill in the points that they have made was really quite staggering in the extreme. Senator Hill spoke initially about freedom of speech and then went on to point out how the exercise of that freedom of speech had run up enormous debts for political parties, clearly indicating that freedom of speech can be bought only by those who have enough money to buy it.

If the argument has been made out, if what is sought is a reasonable request, if on all the evidence it is reasonable that the debate should go on in the way the Opposition proposes, then it ought to be looked at. Unless those propositions are put forward so that the debate moves to where it should be&mdash;that is, what is a reasonable time to which to limit the debate&mdash;we will achieve nothing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In having to use tactics to get proper debate on this issue, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats together have been shown up for precisely what they are: one is a party with no money; the other is a party which is unable to get any, simply because it does not enjoy support of the people. What we are seeing here is a liaison between a party which has no money and a party which cannot get any money because it has no support. What we had early on in the piece was the statement that a party that cannot govern itself cannot govern the country. Equally, it is true to say that a party that cannot handle its own finances cannot handle the nation's finances. We have seen the Labor Party put itself into debt and into bankruptcy. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>If a party cannot govern itself, it cannot govern the country; and if a party cannot govern its finances, it cannot govern the country's finances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a comment from Lurch over there. What we have seen is a conspiracy hatched in this place to get rid of freedom of speech. Today we are debating the guillotine. The guillotine is a pretty permanent sort of mechanism. It ends forever the right of freedom of speech in this nation. Is that the intention of this Government? However, the coalition parties have given an undertaking that when elected, we will repeal the legislation&mdash;if it is successful in being passed. So it will be a temporary piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, it is important to have on the record now the fact that we are utterly opposed and will remain utterly opposed to the banning of the freedom of speech. Not only does the Government want to stop every Australian having the right to have their voice heard by other Australians; it also wants to ban the right to speak in this chamber. Senator McMullan has actually said that the debate going on here is tedious. It certainly is tedious; we are getting very tired of hearing the Labor Party and the Democrats put the proposition that somehow a nation is well served by stopping its citizens being heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a speech from Senator Coulter supporting, yet again, another guillotine&mdash;as the Democrats have done consistently through this Government's term of office. We have heard Senator Coulter say that, really, we will not have anything fresh to say&mdash;as if every senator, who is individually elected, is not entitled to have his words heard and his point of view put on the record. How outrageous it is. He, representing less than 4 per cent of the population, perhaps ought to have 4 per cent of the time. Yet he is in a position to stop the majority numbers in this place&mdash;that is, the coalition members&mdash;from each being able to have their point of view put on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, a government which is both bankrupt financially and morally would have no qualms at all in preventing individual Australians from exercising their right to speak. Is it not interesting that the Government has determined that this is the most important Bill that it has presently before the Senate? Is it not interesting, as one of my colleagues pointed out, that the only reason it was referred to a committee, which spent two months investigating the matter, was that the Democrats were having a leadership stoush, and the Labor Party was unable to fix up a deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee needed two months to let the Democrats sort out their leadership problems so they could stitch up a fresh deal. That is what we are seeing today. The fact that the guillotine is moved and is supported by the Democrats is, of its own, evidence that the deal has been stitched up. We have had two months of hearings; we have seen the damning evidence of Mr Sherry, who almost had to be given protection so that he was not lynched; and we have seen the spectacle of 37 amendments coming in last evening at nine o'clock&mdash;amendments which totally changed the nature of the Bill from when it was first presented in this place. They are 37 amendments which people have to analyse in terms of the report of the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we are told that we are supposed to get rid of the matter in 36 hours. This denies people's rights to voice their views and, indeed, their rights to have time to look upon those amendments as they have been moved. It does not allow people to see and point out to the rest of the Australian people the duplicity and the hypocrisy that is being worked by this Government, which is, as I said, both financially and morally bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a permanent ending of the right to speech, the right to have one's view put and the right to broadcast it. There is not much point in having the right to speak freely if one is not able to have it published. Television and radio represent the right of publishing what one says. In this Parliament we now televise our proceedings. My goodness me, what angst we had to go through in order to let these proceedings be televised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Opposition and coalition is asking that the 37 amendments be referred to a committee to be properly analysed so that there can be proper debate.

It is meant to cut off the right to put one's point of view; it is meant to deny individuals in the Opposition the right to have their view recorded; it is meant, in the end, to curtail the speech of ordinary Australians and somehow to advantage the bankrupt Labor Party, which is now unable to gain more funds, and the Democrats, who represent only 4 per cent of the Australian people, and who are unable to get funds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise that this issue has been the subject of a public debate since the late 1980s. For four years or more it has been up and down and around. All sorts of propositions and arguments have been put. It is absolute hogwash to say that there will have been no opportunity for the community to express its views and the Senate will have had only two full days to discuss the Bill if the guillotine motion, by which the Senate has to complete the debate by 7.30 tomorrow night, is passed. The community has expressed its view in all its forms on and off for nearly four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures for the last two months, I know that we had 120 submissions on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. Everybody in the community had the opportunity to put a view forward. The Liberal Party went around doing everything possible to manufacture submissions. In the rural areas of Victoria, every local government organisation, under Liberal influence, put in one-page submissions. They were all basically the same; they had one paragraph consisting of one sentence which stated, `We oppose the Bill'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had plenty of public hearings. One of my colleagues, Senator Faulkner, even criticised me for allowing far too wide a questioning and a range of witnesses way outside the references for the Bill given to the Committee by the Senate. There was every opportunity for public debate on the ad ban and disclosure Bill. I am now astonished to hear some honourable senators opposite complaining that they have not had a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that Senator Bishop is very disappointed that Senator Kemp and Senator Olsen beat her in the Liberal Party room ballot to go on that Committee. I have to say to Senator Bishop that just maybe this is one time her colleagues were wrong. They may have been better off putting her on the Committee because Senator Olsen and Senator Kemp&mdash;particularly Senator Kemp&mdash;were absolute duds. The only thing that Senator Kemp could do throughout the whole two-month period was ask incessant questions about trade union donations to the Labor Party. That subject was not really in the terms of reference, but he went on and on and he missed the main game. It was as though he had been picked to play on the wing in a football grand final at the MCG and instead turned up to play cricket at the Richmond ground. That was the level of his irrelevancy to the Committee. As a result, the cross-examination from people like Senator Kemp of the witnesses, many of them the Opposition's own witnesses, was very deficient. It did not bring out the evidence that the Opposition wanted. Now the Opposition complains that the majority report has been rigged on the evidence. </PARA>

In my view, the Liberal Party room should never again select either Senator Kemp or Senator Olsen to serve on any select committee because they cannot do the job. They cannot make one recommendation. It is in the document; honourable senators should read the minority report. There is not one recommendation. All it does is oppose the majority report by tipping a heap of bile over it.

I want to draw to the attention of people such as Senator Bishop, who describes herself as an acolyte of Mrs Thatcher and sees Mrs Thatcher as a role model for her own career in politics, that in the back of the report&mdash;and it has not been denied by anybody&mdash;is an appendix showing what other Western democracies do as far as advertising bans are concerned.

Canada, which some may say is a country comparable to ours, has a system in which all advertising is banned on television and radio from the day an election is called. France has regulations brought in by President de Gaulle, another person on the Right with whom Senator Bishop may find some comfort.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion that Senator McMullan moved in this chamber today is a motion to limit the opportunity of this chamber of review to debate not only the Bill which is before us, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991, but also the 37 amendments which this Government produced last night. Interestingly enough, they were 37 amendments that this Government could not even introduce in time for the supposed 8 o'clock start last night of the debate of this Bill. This Government was so incompetent, so useless and so disorganised&mdash;or perhaps so distracted by its disgusting political bedfellows, the Australian Democrats&mdash;that it could not get its amendments into this chamber by 8 o'clock last night. What did it do? It brought them in here today and said, `Right, we are going to guillotine this debate at 7.30 tomorrow evening'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan has the gall and the hypocrisy to stand up before this chamber and say that this is one of the most generous guillotines ever. It is like the axeman saying, `Look, I am particularly nice because I sharpened the blade on my axe'. That is what the Government and the Democrats are doing. It does not matter whether it is a sharp blade or a blunt blade; what they are doing is cutting off the debate in this chamber and cutting off the opportunity of the people's elected representatives to discuss this critical issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Senator Schacht told the Senate that this debate has been going on for four years and there is no need for any more. Quite the contrary: if the debate has been going on for four years, why is this Bill now urgent? The reason this Bill is now urgent is the Labor Party's urgent lack of cash, the Democrats' urgent lack of support and the urgent lack of principle of these parties which together are going to try to guillotine this debate through the Senate. That is what is urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is really urgent is the need for an opportunity for the Australian people to discuss these amendments. Contrary to what Senator Schacht would have this chamber believe, many of the amendments brought forward do not even follow his own report. The people of Australia have the right to debate the matter. It is very interesting that last week we were treated to a display of the Democrats' spleen when we were told how outrageous it was that people were not allowed to demonstrate outside AIDEX in the fashion they wanted. It is outrageous that the people of Australia should not have the right to protest at the disgusting, appalling, grubby little deal that the Democrats have done with the Government. </PARA>

It is because the media will cover the debate and tell Australia what a fraud Senator Coulter is; what a fraud the Minister is; what a fraud the immoral and hypocritical little concertation by these two groups of morally bankrupt people is. That is what the Government and the Democrats do not want&mdash;they do not want the debate taking place during the day; they want to push this Bill through the chamber in the dead of night.

Senator Collins had the audacity to start talking about brown paper bags. Fine; let us talk about big black briefcases; let us talk about his mate Brian Burke. A brown paper bag is not good enough for the Government; it is not good enough for those in the Labor Party, ladies and gentlemen, because they cannot stuff enough money into it. Even after Terry Burke takes his 20 per cent off the top, a brown paper bag is not enough for those in the Labor Party. They cannot cram enough money into a brown paper bag; they need a briefcase.

It is the urgency of the fact that those people over there, through Senator Loosley's brilliant leadership, are going bankrupt almost as fast as is this country.

In terms of the guillotine, if you were ever to get the opportunity to sit on the Government benches&mdash;and it will be a long, long time before it happens&mdash;we will be interested to see whether you repeat the same arguments from this side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there were not a million people unemployed in this country, Senator Collins might have a right to speak on something. But while there are a million people unemployed he ought to keep quiet. What he does not want in the next election campaign is advertising that will portray a million unemployed Australians. That is what he does not want. We are seeking to allow a reasonable period of time for this important piece of legislation to be debated in this place. The point is that important new items have been introduced into this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the recommendation of the majority on the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures said that the talking heads amendment should provide 17 minutes of free time on each station per day. The amendments that we received last night provided for only six minutes. It avoids the debate as to who is going to pay for it. The Government says it is `free time', which means that the stations pay for it. The view of those on this side of the chamber is that that is unreasonable&mdash;the stations should not have to pay for it&mdash;and it is not free time. The parties should pay for it, but of course the Australian Labor Party is bankrupt, morally and financially, and is therefore not prepared to have the parties pay for it as it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stations should have the opportunity to look at what the Government is seeking to impose upon them. The Government does not want them to have the opportunity to do so. The recommendations of the majority say that it is reasonable for there to be graphs of different types, including bar graphs, and various other mechanisms to enable the so-called talking head to project his or her case reasonably. It is not in the amendments. We want to know why. We ought to have the opportunity to consider that. There is serious doubt as to whether the amendments that were introduced late yesterday adequately cover the Government's position in relation to radio. I think it is arguable, when it comes to the allocation of times and the obligations upon stations, that there has been a very serious omission from the amendment the Government put to us last night. It needs to be looked at carefully, not within the timeframe that the Government has allowed. One could go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very serious policy issues are involved in this. The question of who should pay for these talking head advertisements should go to the parties. Our party room should have the opportunity to debate it. The sensible course of action, therefore, would be to send the detail to the Senate Select Committee to be examined and for that Committee to deal with the amendments in as efficient a way as it has been dealing with amendments all year. That is the time-saving method of dealing with this Bill. If we provide a timeframe that gives us until 13 December to deal with this Bill, we allow a reasonable time for the detail to go to the Committee to be examined, the Committee to report to us and, therefore, the Bill to be dealt with in an expeditious way. So rather than the debate taking more time, it would take less time, and the quality of the legislation would be better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed timeframe would enable the States to consider the obligations that are being imposed upon them by this Bill, new obligations that the States were not aware of until the amendments came out late yesterday and which I doubt they have even yet considered. It will allow local governments to consider the obligations and the restraints that are being imposed upon them. It would allow the parties to consider it, as well as the television and radio stations. All we are asking for is a reasonable time for the processes to be dealt with properly. They can be dealt with properly within the amended time allowed by Senator Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not suggesting that all the meantime be consumed by this Bill. We would suggest that the Government get back on to that legislation which has starting dates and which is important for the processes of government. This is only important for the processes of politics because the Government does not want advertisements projecting across the airwaves a million unemployed Australians in the next election campaign. That is what the Government wants to restrain; that is what it does not want at the next election, and that is why it is seeking to prohibit it. I take the opportunity with this motion to suspend Standing Orders to support Senator Macdonald's amendment. It would allow sensible debate of this important motion within a reasonable timeframe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! This procedure raises a difficult question of interpretation which has not arisen before. Senator Hill has a contingent notice of motion to move for the suspension of Standing Orders to remove the time limit on debate. When that motion has been moved in the past, the time allowed for it has been regarded as not coming out of the time allowed for debate on the allotment of time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade why the Australian Government will not recognise an independent Ukraine. What criteria for recognition have not been met?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3880" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government welcomes the results of the referendum of 1 December as the outcome of a democratic process which certainly reflects the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people for control over their political and economic destiny. As I said in Kiev on 22 November when I was visiting, one cannot help but be struck by the real renaissance of Ukrainian national consciousness and pride and by the way in which that was being translated into a manifest desire to establish an independent state. The referendum was, of course, held to determine popular attitudes to the Ukrainian Parliament's own declaration of independence of 24 August. The Ukrainian Parliament will convene this evening, Australian time, to consider the referendum result and follow-up action, which is, of course, likely to include calls specifically for international recognition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole international community, including Australia, is, of course, currently considering its response to such a likely call. The Canadians have already taken a position on that, perhaps not surprisingly given the reality of one million Canadians of Ukrainian origin and the obvious pressures there for very speedy action in this respect. The whole international community has an interest in ensuring security, particularly nuclear security, in minimising instability and in maximising the chances of successful democratisation and economic reform throughout the region. All of these are relevant considerations in determining our attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the recognition issue, a crucial threshold question, here as with the Baltic states and Yugoslavia, will be whether the accepted international criteria for statehood are satisfied, including in particular the question of effective control of territory in a situation where the Soviet authorities retain a very substantial military presence on Ukrainian soil, with the added complication in this case, unlike in the Baltics, of not just a troop presence wearing a Soviet uniform but also, of course, a very substantial nuclear presence including strategic nuclear missiles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other questions will be relevant to Australia's and the international community's consideration of the recognition issue. These would include the following questions: the security and central control of nuclear weapons, given Ukraine's stated commitment to become a non-nuclear state; acceptance and compliance with existing Soviet arms control commitments, such as START, CFE and the biological weapons convention; the commitment to internationally accepted agreements governing standards for the observance of human rights and to protect minority rights; and, finally, arrangements for meeting the Soviet Union's international obligations, particularly the Ukraine's share of the accumulated Soviet Union debt. The Australian Government will be considering all those questions in determining its attitude and having regard to the response of the international community generally, not just individual member states, in determining how we respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that we, as a government, urge the leadership of the Ukraine&mdash;as indeed I did during my visit there&mdash;to engage in a constructive dialogue on all these issues with the authorities in Moscow and the other republics and to work together, so far as humanly possible, to achieve an agreed resolution of these and other inter-republic problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce announced yesterday that the Government would impose a tariff of $12,000 on second-hand Japanese cars brought into Australia in large numbers. Can the Minister advise the Senate if this decision in any way affects people importing cars into Australia for personal use or in low numbers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3881" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The implications in Senator Zakharov's question are true. As there is some querying from the Opposition about this issue, let me explain the background. In Japan there is a policy of charging high registration fees for motor vehicles when they get to their fourth or fifth years. That policy is in place in Japan on environmental grounds relating to exhaust emissions. That policy is also well regarded by the Japanese motor vehicle industry. In Japan the average car life is about seven years, compared with 13 years in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of that policy is simply that at the end of the fourth or fifth year a Mazda 626, for example, could be bought for between $500 and $2,500. As those vehicles sell in Australia for something like $13,000 or $14,000, it is a very nice business for a potential importer to import a car bought at that price in Japan.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Boswell wants to ask me a question about tinned fruit, he should do so and we will talk about tinned fruit. I do not want any of his fruit cake interjections while I am answering this question. Three countries are the logical recipients of cars which are the subject of Japan's policy&mdash;that is, they can be sold virtually at scrap value after four or five years&mdash;if they are sold overseas. Those countries are Singapore, which has no motor vehicle industry; New Zealand, where the penetration of second-hand cars from Japan has increased from 14 per cent in 1988 to 53 per cent in 1991; and the United Kingdom. Those on the other side will remember the United Kingdom, where I am told a policy has been put in place to ensure that second-hand cars imported into the United Kingdom all have to be inspected individually at a very substantial fee. The inspection process is slow and allows 100 cars to be inspected per month.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. That is the first interjection I can remember Senator Alston getting right. They learnt that from the French. That is the Poitiers route for VCRs, as it is called. That is the policy in place in the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, as distinct from New Zealand and Singapore, has a manufacturing automotive industry. The Industry Commission this year reported on that industry and the Government has adopted its recommendations. The report and the decision made by the Government would, of course, be substantially undermined if import penetration of second-hand cars from Japan were to increase at the same rate and with the same potential as in New Zealand. For that reason, the Government has acted to impose a substantial tariff on the importation of second-hand cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the Government in respect of this is that we do not see why Australia should be a recipient of cars which are determined, by the policy of another country, to be essentially unroadworthy. Accordingly, we acted to stop those imports. If the action taken is not adequate, further action will be taken by the Government on this issue. Any importer or potential importer should understand that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Zakharov asked me in the course of her question whether this would affect the importation in low volumes of second-hand cars from overseas. The answer to that is no. The tariff will not apply to cars imported into Australia which are subject to the definition in the Motor Vehicles Standards Act, which allows importation of up to 100 vehicles in particular categories under the provisions of that Act. In answer to the honourable senator's question, the decision which was made yesterday by the Government does not apply to personal imports of cars or low volume imports such as are permitted under the relevant motor vehicle standards legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this was not an easy decision to have to make. But I think it is an important one from the point of view of Australian industry. It is an important one from the point of view of a clear understanding being given to some of our trading partners about the appropriate relationships which exist in a trading partnership of the kind which we have.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Defence. I refer to reports that the Khmer Rouge is refusing to take part in the newly established supreme National Council for Cambodia until the United Nations forces are in place to protect them. In view of the fact that the Australian Government has decided to commit at least 500 Australian defence personnel to the United Nations peacekeeping force&mdash;that is, the full force&mdash;will the Minister guarantee that no members of that force will be used to suppress protests by the ordinary people of Cambodia against representatives of the atrocious Khmer Rouge when they are in Phnom Penh?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a fairly easy guarantee to give because that would not be the role of Australian troops. As most honourable senators know, there are two potential commitments to Cambodia: one already in place, which is UNAMIC, and UNTAC, which is expected to follow. We do not know when it will follow, but we hope it will be in April at the latest. This latest setback has obviously put some doubt over that timetable. Before we commit ourselves to the second matter, certain matters have to be resolved between the Cambodian factions so that we can be assured that we will be going into what is always only a relatively safe environment because, as honourable senators know, for a variety of factors&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister has said previously in answer to questions that the Australian role has not yet been determined. We are very anxious to know what that role is going to be. Is the Minister now saying he will ensure that there is no role possible of the kind I have mentioned for Australian troops?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government would not be disposed to send infantry, for instance, to Cambodia. It is expected of countries with our military sophistication to provide the more specialist functions in Cambodia and not infantry. Many other countries which cannot supply the specialist areas that we are good at can supply infantry, if required. It is on those more specialised areas, communications being a prime example, that Australia would wish to concentrate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning the Prime Minister launched a construction industry reform program. The launch was attended by 250 or more leaders of the Australian construction industry from all walks of life in the industry. The building and construction industry in Australia is a $40 billion per annum industry. It employs half a million Australians. It accounts for 60 per cent of gross fixed capital expenditure in this country. However, its export turnover ratio is at the level of only 2 per cent, compared to the OECD average of 14 per cent. It spends a low amount of money on research and development and, by and large, it is an industry that has been dispute prone in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has therefore embarked on a reform program. That reform program starts by setting out an in-principle agreement outlining the objectives of reform to which all of the principal organisations in the industry have now committed themselves by signing the IPA. It also consists of a code of conduct for the industry in which we rate the performance of companies across a range of indicators which will be used in ascertaining how companies are performing and whether they are eligible for government contracts, State or Federal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reform agency will supervise the reform process. That is headed at the board level by Mr Paul White, the chief executive of Concrete Constructions, a national builder, and at executive officer level by Mr Ern MacDonald, who was formerly the chief construction manager of Civil and Civic and is a distinguished and recognised figure in the industry. The directors of the board are Malcolm Kinnaird of Kinhill Engineers; Jack Ritch of the AMP Society; David Chandler of Fletcher Construction Group; Martin Albrecht of Thiess Contractors and Robert Milne of Hooker Cockram, as well as Martin Ferguson of the ACTU, Stan Sharkey of the BWIU and departmental representatives. Obviously, it is a balanced board representing major employers in the industry as well as the key unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform program involves the setting up of model sites in which new methods of doing work will be trialled and proven up, and perhaps will then be a basis for wider adaptation in the industry. We have also established a tripartite council of some 47 members from industry, unions and government. All of the organisations, ranging from quantity surveyors through to earth movers and heavy construction companies, as well as the key unions, are represented on that construction industry development council. Therefore, the Government proceeds down this course of quite historic reform in this key industry sector for Australia with the support of all the major players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am therefore disappointed to see a press release in the name of John Howard, the Opposition shadow Minister, attacking this initiative, which has such clear and widespread support in the Australian community. He laughingly heads his press release, `A cave in to union power'. Of course, all of the major industry associations have signed and committed themselves to the reform process that we have undertaken. Every industry association that has a place in this industry is part of the advisory council under which this program shall be conducted. Of course, among those are some trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then, of course, this Government is committed to working with Australians from whatever walk of life, to pool their talents and abilities and to work together to reform our basic institutions.

We, as a Government, recognise that. In terms of that policy relating to the recession, as Senator Short puts it, the Government has embarked on a series of interest rate reductions over the last 12 to 18 months, and those will have an effect on the recovery from the current recession.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) to a question without notice asked this day by Senator Childs relating to productivity growth.</PARA>
<PARA>During his answer today on a question relating to productivity growth in Australia, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, as he has done on several recent occasions, drew attention to page 342 of the coalition's Fightback proposal's main document. He has sought to portray the figures for various scenarios in the modelling given on page 342 as the figures for productivity growth and other factors that would occur in the event of the coalition's Fightback proposals being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the Senate that the Minister is being totally misleading in making that assertion. If he looks at the first page of the relevant chapter relating to this matter&mdash;that is, page 333&mdash;he will see a reference to the Access Economics projections, which are on page 342. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a number of elements of the policy change underlying the "High Road" Scenario are similar to those embodied in the Coalition's policy package, the analysis does not purport to portray the outcomes which would be achieved by implementation of that package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, since the extent and scope of reform contained in the Coalition's policy package is without precedent in post-war history, it is unlikely that models based on economic performance over that period would be able to capture accurately the outcomes which might be expected to flow from its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Access Economics analysis summarised below must be seen primarily as providing a framework for the debate about medium-term solutions to our economic problems which must occur if we are to avoid a further decline in our living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer than those words. Those words say that the scenario on page 342 to which Senator Button has referred are illustrative only. The `high road' scenario, which shows the higher scenario productivity paths, is obviously a major underestimate of the productivity growth that would occur as a result of the coalition's Fightback proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor does it&mdash;this is the important point because this is where Senator Button is misleading the Senate&mdash;even vaguely purport to fully, accurately and adequately reflect the coalition's approach. It does not take into account all the factors in the coalition's proposals which would automatically lead to lower business input costs; therefore the scope for higher saving, higher investment and higher productivity growth in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not take account of all the tax reductions, such as the abolition of seven taxes: the abolition of the wholesale sales tax; the abolition of payroll tax; the abolition of the petroleum products excise; the abolition of the superannuation lump sum tax; the phase-out of all customs duties over the next decade; the abolition of the training guarantee levy; and the abolition of the coal export duty. I interpose to say that I am delighted to see that the Government today has had the brains to adopt one part, albeit a small part, of the Fightback proposals. Hopefully, it will be the first of many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is that the productivity performance that would occur as a result of the abolition of those taxes on business inputs&mdash;taxes totalling almost $20 billion&mdash;would of course have an enormous impact on investment, on the cost of production and therefore on productivity growth in Australia. It would therefore impact on our ability to compete in export markets and against imports. That is not&mdash;nor was it ever&mdash;contained in the Access Economics scenarios on page 342. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that can be said is this: that table on page 342 shows the `base case' scenario should there be a continuation of existing Government policies. That figure shows that productivity growth over the period through to 1999 would be about 0.43 per cent. On the `high road' scenario, which is a gross underestimate of the productivity growth that would be achieved through the coalition's Fightback proposals, the productivity growth factor would be 0.8 per cent&mdash;double the figure that would arise under the maintenance of the Government's existing policies. </PARA>

May I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that document presented three scenarios from a well-known, highly respected Murphy model. It followed the consequences of each of those scenarios. It is quite mischievous to suggest that the Liberal Party has got its numbers wrong or is confusing them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document did state was that the Liberal-National Party coalition in government would follow certain scenarios in adopting a policy of micro-economic reform, the consequences of which would be not dissimilar from those expressed in the Murphy model. The point is that implicit in the answer was an incorrect comparison between the OECD productivity data for Australia for the period 1983-90 and the figures used by Access Economics in the supplementary paper of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. The point is that the two sets of figures cannot be properly compared, as Senator Button somehow tried to do&mdash;this was a further furphy&mdash;because the OECD numbers relate to labour productivity in the business sector, while the Access measures refer specifically to the total real GDP per employee. </PARA>

<PARA>In conclusion, the high road&mdash;the preferred option of the Hewson plan&mdash;offers double the productivity of the Hawke Government's low road case during the last decade. Therefore, I think it is regrettable that Senator Button, representing the Government, this afternoon misconstrued the document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues Senator Short and Senator Watson have drawn attention to Senator Button's misquoting and misuse of the figures for the various high road, medium road and low road scenarios for the current decade. I draw the attention of the Senate to another matter that Senator Button has focused on, that is, the productivity growth which occurred during the 1980s when Senator Button and his colleagues were in government. In the answers by Senator Button some play was made about productivity growth in this area. It may be enlightening to honourable senators and others to learn that during this period Australia enjoyed an average productivity growth of 0.9 per cent per annum. If we compare that with other countries&mdash;countries of world best practice, a term which has become commonplace&mdash;it is worth noting that in Japan, in contrast to the 0.9 per cent productivity growth for Australia, there was productivity growth of 3.4 per cent per annum. This was almost four times the productivity growth per annum that we enjoyed in Australia. In France the productivity growth was 2.3 per cent; in Italy 2.3 per cent; in Germany 1.7 per cent&mdash;almost twice the productivity growth in Australia; and in Canada 1.3 per cent. Australia was noted during the period of the Hawke Government for extraordinarily low productivity growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Button has pulled the same stunt again today. He made comments and allegations during Question Time while he was on TV. Then, when we got up and sought to debate these matters, of course, Senator Button, like so many other Ministers in this Government, cut and ran.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the answer which Senator Button gave earlier today he chose to refer to page 342 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document carrying the subtitle `The way to build and reward Australia'. In so doing, he showed himself to be yet one more floundering Minister. I think it is important, in case anybody feels sorry for him because he is not on top of the material and therefore finds himself floundering, that we perhaps read from page 345 and then reflect upon how his own department interprets the current situation. I think this passage is quite important. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The favourable economic effects of the lift in productivity under the "High Road" scenario are reinforced by a cut in government consumption spending that lowers government expenditure in 1995-96 to its 1992-93 level, compared with a 6.6 per cent increase under the other two scenarios. This allows both lower income taxes than the other scenarios and reduces government borrowing, and induces a lower exchange rate. This encourages net exports and results in a lower current account deficit to GDP ratio of 3.7 per cent in 1999-00, compared with 4 1/2 per cent under the "Low Road" scenario. Foreign debt is 54 per cent of GDP at the end of the decade and falling by 0.8 percentage points per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>The importance of that statement is probably recognised by Senator Button's own department and, indeed, by his own Deputy Secretary, Dr Bell, who, back on 23 July, made a very sensible speech which was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. He said that there was increased pressure on the Government for further tax reform. He increased this pressure by criticising the indirect tax system as `penalising exporters, while business is urging changes to promote long-term investment projects'. The exact words of the report are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exporters are being penalised by the present "morass" of taxes, which cannot be rebated, according to Dr Bell, in contrast with competitors overseas who operate under "value-added taxes"&mdash;a form of consumption tax</PARA>

<PARA>As I said at the beginning, lest anybody feel sorry for Senator Button getting it wrong, like Mr Howe, lest anybody feel that Senator Button has not quite had the opportunity to get on top of the material, understand that his own department knows only too well that reform is essential, and that his own Deputy Secretary has gone on the record saying that the current system of the wholesale sales tax and the other morass of taxes is penalising Australia to the tune of 5 per cent per annum.

The impression he tried to create was that this Government has been battling on fairly successfully against all odds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put a slightly different suggestion&mdash;what I believe to be the truth&mdash;to this chamber, namely, that the Government has done an appalling job in relation to productivity growth. Those of us who are not economists can sometimes get confused by people talking about fiscal policy, monetary policy and `change this, change that', tinkering here and there with the mix of economic policies that are available to a government. But the bottom line is that what we want to come out at the end of the day from those policies is increased productivity. We want the nation to be producing more per hour worked and per employee. That generates the opportunity for more and safer jobs. It is something that I would have thought this Government should have been interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps germane to have a look at some of the remarks that Senator Button made. As I understand it, one of the claims he made was that this Government has been battling on against all odds, and that one of the difficulties in increasing productivity has been the price of capital. As I saw his face, he showed not a glimmer of embarrassment in offering that as a reason for not having the productivity growth we should have. Is it not those on this side of the chamber who have been saying since your Government got in, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the interest rate policy was too high, that the price of capital to manufacturing was too high, and that as a consequence people would not be shifting money into investment and into long term projects because they simply could not afford to do it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Day in and day out in this place, those on this side of the chamber, and even perhaps the Democrats on occasions, have been trying to point out to the Government that one of the reasons for the failure to increase productivity growth was the cost of capital. We were pointing out that it was this Government's high interest rate policy that directly relates to the cost of capital. Yet we have one of the most senior Ministers coming into this chamber today and saying, `We have been battling on quite well against the tide of the cost of capital', as though his hands were not on any of those levers. But he was sitting in Cabinet with Senator Evans and Mr Keating. Senator Tate and all the others went along with these policies which pushed up the price of capital and made it too expensive for a businessman or businesswoman to invest in new plant and equipment. That is why investment in plant and equipment has dropped off very badly under this Government. What were people doing? They were investing in bricks and mortar, not in plant and equipment that can generate jobs for the workers that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, came into government to represent. That is why we now have in many sectors of industry outdated, dilapidated equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a massive capital reinvestment in plant and equipment to bring us up to some sort of technological edge, at least, in some of these industries. That is the first point I wanted to make. It is a disgrace for Senator Button&mdash;who has now disappeared because he thinks he has better things to do&mdash;to come in here and offer as a reason for poor performance in productivity growth the cost of capital without even blushing and admitting that he has had a hand in pushing up the cost of capital and keeping it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make is that Senator Button in his usual jocular way says, `Look, between you and me, you cannot take too much notice of these productivity figures. There are different measures here, different measures there'. He is almost saying, `I don't know, it is all too complicated; no-one can work anything out'. Mr Acting Deputy President, why do you think the OECD and every other credible economic forecasting body makes a stab at productivity figures? Why do we bother looking at them if they are not worth anything? That is the question we need to put to Senator Button. Sure, there are different measures; I understand that. By and large, we use real GDP per hour worked, whereas the OECD countries use GDP per employed person. But we collect all those figures and we can make oranges with oranges comparisons. It is not as though there is some fruit salad of figures that every government finds totally incomprehensible. It is quite possible to make very sensible comparisons using the same sorts of figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button, who is supposed to be leading the Government in the Senate, says basically in his answers, `It is all a bit difficult. There are all different measures here and there and you really cannot compare. It is all too hard'. It is an outrageous admission basically of incompetence on his part. As to the impression he wanted to create, namely, that the Labor Government has not been doing too badly, let us have a look. We concede that there has been an actual fall in the rate of productivity growth in six of the last nine quarters since June 1989. The figures for another quarter are coming out at the end of this week, and I will be interested to see what the result is. I would not be surprised by a small rise in productivity. Why? Because more people are losing their jobs and so the productivity per person increases. There are fewer persons employed. That is a function of the policies of your Government, Mr Acting Deputy President, and the Government of Senator West and Senator Tate. There are more people out of work, and everybody opposite has had a hand in it. They are all going along with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a fall in the rate of productivity growth in six of the past nine quarters. What does the Minister have to say about that?  Why have we had that type of fall while other nations have not?  What is the explanation? That is what we want to hear, not some gobbledegook about one set of figures being different from another. Just on the set of figures that we produced for this nation, we find that there has been a fall in six of the past nine quarters. I think we deserve at least an explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that the productivity increases in two of the three quarters which did not suffer a fall were generated by a loss of jobs, which is not exactly the smartest way to generate such an outcome. But it happens. If we lose people from the work force and the same GDP is produced, obviously there is a real increase because a smaller number of people are producing the same number of things. It would be much better if the same number of people were producing more. As I say, there has been a fall in six of the past nine quarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Labor Government is so keen to compare its performance in the 1980s with the performance of Liberal governments, it might be worth looking at that as well. If we look at the changes in real gross domestic per hour worked&mdash;that is, productivity growth&mdash;we find that under Fraser it increased on average by 1.6 per cent while the Hawke Government has managed only 0.94 per cent. I suppose to some people who may be listening, there does not seem to be much difference between 0.94 per cent and 1.6 per cent. But when we are talking about the economy as a whole, they are not small figures at all. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I would like to draw to the Senate's attention is how we compare with other industrialised nations. Let me turn to a different measure of productivity. We have been looking at real GDP per hour worked. If we look at real GDP per employed person, we will see that, while the OECD nations have been speeding up their productivity growth, Australia has been slowing down. Senator Button has not given us an answer as to why that should be the case. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our total productivity during the Hawke era has been equally dismal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last, but certainly not least, it is worth looking at the productivity growth of some of the Asian nations. Our productivity growth, measured as changes in real GDP per employed person, has been below that of Korea and Hong Kong in every year except one. While we have been struggling to get growth rates of up to 4 per cent, the rates for both Hong Kong and Korea have jumped up to around the 10 per cent per annum mark. We have simply not been measuring up. We can see that the result of that is nearly one million people unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final remark is this:  it is most unfortunate if Senator Button wants to come in here and pretend that he understands productivity.

<PARA>In answer to a question asked during Question Time today, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) referred to a press release that I put out yesterday. I was fascinated to hear the way in which he approached this issue. What is really of concern to the Australian public is the extent to which the Government, with its vast resources, is able to keep track of its own expenditure. Very much at issue, therefore, must be the capacity of the Department of Social Security, which administers something of the order of $28 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of his answer today, Senator Richardson effectively said that he concedes that his Department's estimates were something of the order of $718m short of actual expenditure. My press release referred to four particular examples of areas&mdash;not an exhaustive list by any means&mdash;in which there were discrepancies. Of course, Senator Richardson did not quarrel with three of the four, and, therefore, one can take it that he concedes those amounts&mdash;$178m, $14.5m and $10.9m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the estimate for outlays on unemployment benefit-Jobsearch allowance, the figure in the 1991 Budget estimate was $4.2 billion while the 1991 actual outlay was $4.7 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the classic reasons that the Department has not been able to do the job emerges from Senator Richardson's answer the preceding day to a question from Senator West, who asked him about the waiting time for the Jobsearch allowance. Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A great many people are inconvenienced and do suffer hardship&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, as a result of the Government's policies in failing to deliver any significant economic growth over the past eight years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because of the waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Senator Richardson is conceding that there is a dramatic level of need in certain sections and yet he is absolutely refusing to make any significant funds available to voluntary agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator West can somehow pretend that that is a compassionate approach to the real needs of the agencies, she ought to think twice about the advice that she gives to Senator Richardson. For example, she only has to look at what the Brotherhood of St Laurence had to say, as reported on the front page of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper. If she does, she can contrast the level of demand with the impecunious, parsimonious response of the Government. Senator Richardson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>hardship&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">some 20 per cent of applicants now qualify under hardship provisions. The hardship provisions are pretty simple:  if one has in the bank less than two weeks of the benefit, which is less than $300, one would qualify.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the hardship test as far as Senator Richardson is concerned. The fact is that the hardship test involves a great deal more than that. It involves the application of a liquid funds or available funds test, which involves an inquiry into whether people have payments available, payments from previous employment, cash on hand, money in a bank or other financial institutions, shares, debentures, other investments, other moneys available at short notice, income available but not yet paid, or instalments of income due within the fortnight from date of lodgment. Indeed, the manual says that the liquid funds of a partner or a bank accounts held on behalf of dependent children should also be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, a whole range of matters simply are not being taken into account by the Department in the administration of this test and they ought to be. This is clearly condoned by Senator Richardson, who says that it is simply a matter of whether a person has $300 in the bank. If a person does not, he can get the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is that tested?  My press release says&mdash;on the basis of inquiries made by me&mdash;that no checking is done. People simply fill in a claim form and the Department takes their word for it. In other words, it is a notoriously unreliable measure of actual need. What does Senator Richardson say today? He says, `We ask them to produce bank accounts'. Does that go anywhere near meeting the requirements specified in the manual?  There have to be inquiries about all those other matters. One would have thought that the mere production of a bank account is nowhere near sufficient to meet those requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, Senator Richardson has come into this chamber and admitted that the administration of his Department is notoriously lax, because intuitively it is very hard to believe that one in five people do not have $300 or more to sustain them once they lose employment. By definition, they have been in the work force, they have been earning money and they have a whole range of other entitlements, yet we are led to believe that one in five people do not have two sticks to rub together. That may or may not be true but one could have no skerrick of confidence that it is accurate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Based on the proposition that Senator Richardson is conceding that his Department does no effective testing or scrutiny as required by its own regulations, it ought to be quite clear that there is a very big hole in the estimate of 20 per cent that he produced. Therefore, our estimate which takes account of moneys available to people through early retirement, termination payments, redundancy payments and the level of time they have been in the work force&mdash;which we estimate to be 18 per cent&mdash;is much more likely to be an accurate figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the least Senator Richardson could do is concede that all he is trying to do is mount a scare campaign. In what he said yesterday&mdash;not in his answer, but subsequently&mdash;he is pretending that 50 per cent of people who have lost their jobs and are out of work for four to five weeks would not have more than $300.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we combine that with Senator Richardson's own admission in the Senate today that the Government's Budget costings are $718m out, acting on the basis of the Budget estimates of outlays on unemployment benefits&mdash;as they then were for 1990-91&mdash;it is quite clear that a tremendous amount of work needs to be done in Senator Richardson's own backyard before we can attach a skerrick of credibility to his costings. No doubt that is the major reason why the Government has backed off from its decision taken earlier this week for Senator Richardson to call a press conference to explain where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document's figures are inaccurate.

<PARA>It suggests that the best remedy to the problems of farmers is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> or `Frightpack'&mdash;whichever way one wants to look at it. The trouble is that there is a huge credibility problem with this language. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it beats `incentivation' as a corny phrase. The problem in the rural sector in Australia is that there has been a collapse of international commodity prices in most of our agricultural exports, over which this country has little control but which has tried to meet the needs of the rural community. The other problem is the drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty with the credibility of this motion is: how will anyone believe that the introduction of a new tax of 15 per cent on all rural produce will help resolve the international commodity price problem or the drought? How will a new tax of 15 per cent do that? One does not have to think very deeply or for too long to see that it will not. One can conclude therefore that this motion is beside the point and irrelevant. It is simply an attempt to try to make it appear that rural Australia somehow has a vested interest in supporting the goods and services tax of Dr Hewson, a goods and services tax which will impose a new tax of 15 per cent on every bushel of wheat, on every clip of wool and on every pound of meat sold off the farm. The price to consumers will be much higher and, therefore, buyer resistance will be greater. To define it as it really is, not as the motion tries to, is to describe the dilemma of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government acknowledges the pain that the Australian community has undergone during the recession&mdash;a recession which has severely hit all of the nations in the Western world. As the Australian economy has adjusted to the impact of the recession, there have been positive economic outcomes which will be maintained in the future. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Bernie Fraser, said in Tokyo on 26 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will come out of the recession in better condition than we have been in for years&mdash;the recovery will be marked by lower inflation and greater productivity and profitability than we have seen in a long time.</PARA>
<PARA>Inflation has been curbed for the first time in decades in Australia. The consumer price index has been steadily declining since the December quarter 1990. The CPI in the September quarter 1991 stands at an annual rate of 3.3 per cent&mdash;the lowest increase since the March quarter 1970, after Medicare has been taken into account. This decline in inflation has been partly the result of deliberate government policies under the accord process, particularly the wage-tax trade-off at the beginning of this calendar year. As honourable senators will remember, that occurred in September last year. The drop in inflation that has occurred now puts Australia's inflation rate below that of our major OECD trading partners and below that of the OECD average. It gives Australia an edge in international competitiveness, a result which is very favourable to the export orientation of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a decline in inflation, interest rates have fallen markedly. Since the beginning of 1990, short term interest rates have been halved, with cash rates declining from 18 per cent to 8 1/2 per cent. The drop in interest rates will significantly reduce costs to rural industry during a time of drought and intense international competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, there has been an ambitious program of micro-economic reform. The Hawke Labor Government has also been undertaking a program of massive micro-economic reform, much of which has benefited rural industries and, in the long term, will substantially lower their costs. For instance, the waterfront reform program has seen a 50 per cent reduction in the cost of grain stevedoring. The work force at grain terminals has been reduced by up to 70 per cent. Since 1988-89, the time required to turn around grain vessels has almost halved from an average of 4.52 days to 2.4 days. Overall savings to the grain industry are estimated to be at least $10m annually. No lesser an authority than the Australian Wheat Board has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian ports are now amongst the most efficient grain loading ports in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government is very conscious of the problems being experienced by many farmers as a result of the rural downturn, low prices in the world commodity markets and drought conditions. This rural downturn is particularly severe. The short term outlook for many commodities is bleak. Many farmers living in rural Australia face considerable financial pressures and have few alternative employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises these problems. We are not sitting on our hands. We have developed a range of measures to assist farmers. These have been done quickly and to help those in most need. We have responded with a comprehensive targeted rural assistance package which includes, amongst other things, increased rural adjustment scheme funding, new social security provisions and assistance for farmers affected by the drought. The package has been well received by the farming sector. It demonstrates what this Government's commitment is to Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme encourages structural adjustment in rural industry by providing assistance to individual farmers for farm expansion and development; it improves the efficiency of Australian rural industry and its international competitiveness. Depending on farmers' particular circumstances, RAS assistance is available to them to improve their farms or to maintain their farms, or to leave their farms where their enterprise has no long term prospects. The Federal Government announced in October this year an increase in RAS funding of $60m in a full year to a total of $173m for 1991-92. As well as that, from 1 December this year, eligible farmers will be able to claim Job Search and Newstart allowances of up to $13,078 a year for married people, with an additional $624 for each child. These benefits have replaced the former unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements mean that farmers in extreme circumstances will find it easier to claim these benefits. Until now, many farmers have found it difficult to obtain unemployment benefits from the Department of Social Security because they could not satisfy the work test criteria of being unemployed. This applied even if they were not actively farming their property and were doing some minimal farm maintenance. This arrangement will inject another $10m into rural assistance this financial year and an additional $20m for 1992-93. Some 2,000 farmers will be assisted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policy on drought assistance is that drought is a naturally recurring feature of the Australian climate, an ongoing commercial risk associated with rural enterprise. We provide assistance for drought where it causes financial hardship, just as we do where the hardship is caused by other factors, such as low prices, which are beyond the control of farmers. The national drought policy will be considered by the Australian Agricultural Council in February of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World agricultural markets are dominated by high production levels, high stocks and widespread agricultural support policies. This is why Australian farmers are experiencing low world market prices, with prices for wool expected to fall by 32 per cent in 1991-92, with falls of 13 per cent for sugar and 22 per cent for rice, and with cotton down by about 5 per cent. But there are some signs of price improvements for wheat and meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government's attention has been directed towards reaching a favourable outcome for the Cairns Group of countries in the latest Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, recently led a delegation to Europe which included members of the Opposition and the National Farmers Federation. This delegation impressed on European leaders the need for substantial improvements in agricultural negotiations during the Uruguay Round. All these add up to a positive range of measures to assist farmers, in contrast to the Opposition's goods and services tax package which offers a chilling future for the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by repeating that there are problems visited on the farm sector by the drought and by international prices. Because of that, we have put measures in to ameliorate the effects on the rural sector. But what would damage the rural sector in this country more than almost anything else would be the introduction of a new tax which would impose a cost of 15 per cent on all goods and services sold or produced off the land in this country. That would be the single most cold-blooded, devastating blow that could be delivered to farmers in this community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not entirely, but to some extent we might debate that. Having taking the credit for one drought ending, the Government cannot get away from this one. The other pressures are entirely the result of the economic rationalist policies to which this Government is committed and which the coalition supports. That blind devotion of both parties to the philosophy of tariff reductions to achieve a supposedly level playing field is a monument to flat earth economics. That devotion has been responsible for much of the misery we see in rural Australia today. It has undermined our markets, it has threatened our infrastructure and it has reduced the viability of our country towns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That devotion has recently been challenged by the NFF, the MTIA, the Australian Dairy Industry Council, the Queensland Cane Growers Association and by economic commentators in recent issues of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. Like me, these groups and individuals have become disenchanted with policies which have led to supermarket shelves being stuffed with overseas produce. The policies have led to dumped fruit juices flooding our markets; they have led to dumped dried apricots, which have been well described by some of our farmers as `bad lemons'; and they have led to the notorious situation which has been described only in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that issue, in the section headed `Epicure'&mdash;and I think it is quite appropriate that the front of that section displays beetroots and radishes, my regard for which honourable senators will be aware of&mdash;we are told right at the beginning of the `fight for 3 cents an orange'. In that article, by Rita Erlich and Richard Yallop, we are reminded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are about 700 citrus growers along the Murray Valley and last financial year each made a loss of about $3000. A big contributing factor was the competition&mdash;not always fair&mdash;from foreign imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, orange growers saw their late-summer valencias competing in the Australian market against imported Californian navels&mdash;even though the United States refuses to let in Australian oranges&mdash;and then they watched the price of juicing oranges plummet as the Brazilians, who control 30 per cent of the world orange-juice market, drove down prices.</PARA>
<PARA>That situation which Australians find themselves in can be described as `misery' because it is a situation in which they have very little control. They can grow the best oranges around but, faced with that sort of situation and having little control over it, the reaction is one of misery. I have no disagreement with that word as used in this matter of public importance. But they are also miserable because they  see no respite from their circumstances&mdash;and there is no respite being offered in the package that is being touted by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About the only guarantee that is available to Australian farmers, as is available to all Australians at the moment, is the guarantee that the Australian Democrats have given that we will not permit the necessities of life to be taxed&mdash;certainly not to be subjected to a goods and services tax. The coalition package offers neither the respite that Australian farmers need nor the hope which is claimed in this matter of public importance. The package that we have constantly heard about in the last couple of days could be better described as a `Flightback'&mdash;a flight back to the prehistoric mumbo jumbo of the failed theories of economic rationalism, the dogma which says that money is king, that money is God and that money rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see evidence of this at page 308 of the `Flightback' package. There John, Valerie and their three children are used as an example of a farming family in Australia. That page is all about money. There is a promise there which John and Valerie&mdash;and I believe all Australian farmers would reflect this attitude&mdash;will believe when they see it. It is a promise which suggests that John and Valerie will be better off in three years time by some $30 a week. They would be well advised, as would I, to believe that when they see it turn up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the great hope. That is the best that is offered in this package. There is no mention of anything else other than money. Page 308 is solely concerned with money. What really concerns our farmers is reliability of markets; fairness in competition, both here and overseas; access to infrastructure and community services, such as education and health; productivity of their land and its continued productivity; and the continued fertility of their land&mdash;in other words, soil conservation. That is a hint that most of Australia's farmers have been traditionally concerned with being able to hand on to their descendants fertile, productive properties. They are concerned with a lot more than cash money. They are concerned with heritage values and with the traditional values, which enable them to admire the goodness that they can get out of their soil and its continuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we see any of these concerns reflected in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! </EMPHASIS>document? We certainly do not. We see about three-quarters of a page of cursory comment about the environment, a few platitudes about how wonderful it is and how we ought to encourage a few more tourists to come and look at it. That is the clue to the coalition's attitude here. It sees the environment as something that is separate, something outside the window to be looked at. The environment is what we live in and it is what farmers work with and nurture to earn their living and ours. By using and nurturing the environment, farmers are able to add to the prosperity of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic rationalist gurus that are worshipped by this mob&mdash;that is, both major parties&mdash;can provide no indicators, no direction and no incentive to help our farmers nurture their environment and to sustain their future and ours.

He was unable to offer any suggestion. He said it was too early to ask and that they had to think about it.

I commend the article by David Porter in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> because it is most enlightening and that is the sort of model which we should be following and emphasising. Those are the sorts of farmers who are fighting back against the economists' gobbledegook which has served us so poorly in delivering the situation we have now in rural Australia. These people are nurturing their land and instead of insulting them with the sort of verbiage that we have before us today, we should be congratulating them and we should be helping others to follow their examples to provide the entire country with a sustainable future instead of one which is so bleak and has no offer of respite from either the coalition's `Flightback' package or the continuation of the Government's present policies.</PARA>

A major rebuilding of the economic environment in which our farmers&mdash;the most efficient in the world, as Senator Archer has said&mdash;have to operate is now critically important. As Senator Archer said, the Opposition's Fightback package will enable farmers to cope with their worst downturn in 60 years&mdash;a downturn presided over by our current Treasurer, Mr Kerin, when he was the formerly ineffectual Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It amazes me that this Government is so intent on its factional deals that it rewards a man who has achieved what no other Minister in Australia's history has achieved&mdash;the destruction of our rural sector&mdash;by giving him the reins on all Government economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Fightback package&mdash;I am sure that all honourable senators have seen it&mdash;will ensure for rural industries that, in the medium to long term, recovery will be both assisted and locked in place by lower costs, cheaper interest rates and stable, sensible dollar levels. Above all, a revitalised economy resulting from these reforms outlined by Senator Archer, and also our industrial relations policy, will deliver an environment in which long term prosperity can be generated. It will ensure that farms are better able to cope with the seasonal and market vagaries that are part and parcel of farming life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> is an entire package. It is not just a GST.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous advantages for the rural community resulting from this visionary package. In addition to its overall benefits for the rural sector, this package will help rural women and their families in particular. It will help them with the abolition of petrol excise, which will dramatically reduce the cost for rural women to access services for themselves and their families, and it will significantly reduce transport costs, which will benefit rural women living in remote areas and Aboriginal communities with reduced costs for food and clothing. The package includes zone rebate increases of at least 25 per cent which will help women and families in remote areas, as will our proposal to increase family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be improved health access, especially with mobile units, which will provide mammography and testing for osteoporosis; the establishment of a training course in a rural centre, which will give nurses additional training to prepare for a career in isolated areas where there is little or no medical back-up; medicare rebates will be available from retail pharmacies; and the reform of the assets test will ensure that people in genuine need, such as retired farmers living on the family farm, are not precluded from the age pension, and I believe that is something of great importance. The package will ensure that all reasonable cases of hardship are fully considered in determining eligibility for the age pension.

<PARA>Two issues which are hurting rural women and their children, in particular, these days are education and health services. Already, rural women and children are significantly disadvantaged. Without question, they have reduced opportunities for education, health services, cultural experience and, of course, future employment. Those of us who inhabit this nation are all Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has done nothing to try to bridge this rift. Indeed, its policies have contributed to a disturbing widening of the gulf between these two nations. This Government has demonstrated that it has no interest in those non-metropolitan Australians. Its neglect effectively punishes those who, for a variety of reasons, choose not to live in the cities and big rural towns. To be a non-metropolitan Australian under this Labor Government is to be second class&mdash;a member of the B team, a reserve grade Australian. </PARA>

This Government's continual attempts to socialise medicine have led to a situation where country surgeries are closing and hospitals are downgrading services. Already, country people have reduced opportunities to receive specialised health services, as they either have to forgo the service or spend excessive amounts of money to travel to cities for their health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other examples of the way this Government has treated people who live in the country. I believe there are many problems with schooling for the children who live in the outback. So many of them have to be assisted with their schooling by means of correspondence.

Parents have to drive their children excessive distances mornings and afternoons in order to catch a school bus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I have said, we can see many of the problems which have arisen because of the way people in rural Australia have been treated by this Government. The situation reflects the incapacity of remote families to cope with the financial burdens associated with living in rural areas and it is set to worsen. It is not as though this Government has simply turned its back on rural problems, letting them fester by callous neglect. It is worse than that: its policies have worked actively to make things worse. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fluctuations of farm incomes or of the prices of farm commodities, particularly for an exporting nation like Australia, are cyclical factors which have been around for as long as Australian agriculture has been around. At present, this has been aggravated for a significant number of farmers by drought and by the policies which were adopted with respect to the wool industry, at the recommendation of the wool industry itself, about three years ago&mdash;for which all members of this Parliament on both sides, including the Australian Democrats, ought to take some responsibility. </PARA>

The underlying reality behind that, at least with regard to grain farming, is that gross over-investment in plant and equipment is the norm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza knows that very well. Like me, Senator Panizza grew up on a wheat farm in Western Australia and, like me, he has planted 25 or 30 wheat crops and he still has some contact with the industry. He knows very well that gross over-investment in plant and equipment is the norm in grain growing and in some other agricultural industries in Australia. Therefore, while it would be undesirable for other reasons, and for sectors other than agriculture, if there were a moratorium on plant and equipment investment in Australian wheat farming for five years the impact on efficiency would be barely measurable. Let us get that into perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the matter of public importance that has been submitted refers to the alleged hope for farmers contained in the package that the Opposition released a couple of weeks ago. Where is the hope? I will be objective about this: yes, there is one bit of good news for farmers, or at least for farmers who are exporters. Because the value added tax&mdash;which the Opposition calls a goods and services tax&mdash;will not apply to products that are ultimately exported, there will be an advantage to all Australian exporters in this tax system. But keep it in perspective. It probably amounts to little more than a 1c change in the exchange rate. That is about what it is worth to exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the negatives. Nobody denies that there will be an increase in the consumer price index in the order of 5 per cent. Some would put it higher than that, and I suspect it will be. Some people believe that that will be a one-off increase. It may not be. If everything the Opposition says is to be believed, the chain of cause and effect will go something like this: if this package is introduced, the consumer price index will go up by 5 per cent overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to stop that sharp overnight increase in the CPI settling down into a new, continuing and higher level of inflation, the Opposition, if it is in government, will have to do one of two things: it will have to tighten either fiscal policy or monetary policy. It has already ruled out the fiscal policy option. It has undertaken that all its expenditure cuts&mdash;nebulous though some of those are&mdash;and all the increased revenue from its value added tax will be delivered back in income tax cuts, or so it says. In other words, the option of tightening fiscal policy has been closed off by the Opposition three years in advance. </PARA>

The answer to that is monetary policy&mdash;high interest rates which, among other things, push  up the exchange rate. It would not take a very significant increase in interest rates to push up the exchange rate by more than the 1c gain, or perhaps the 1 1/2c gain, that exporting agricultural industries, or all exporting industries, would gain from the changeover towards a value added tax which would be rebatable on products exported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bjelke-Petersen read out a list of alleged benefits to various people in the country. One or two of them may have been justifiable. One was that petrol would no longer have the present excise applied to it. But we know that, for the Opposition to deliver on its commitment to land transport reform, if petrol were not taxed at its present level the Opposition would have to tax something else. The Opposition has not fixed the hole in its arithmetic that arose from that. As I understand it, and nobody has contradicted it, there is a rort here&mdash;a typical old Country Party-type rort&mdash;that would enable farmers to use excise-free petrol not for running the farm, because the amount of petrol used in agriculture production is negligible, but for running to town, to the city and all over the place. That is a rort. Farmers might welcome it, but they are not entitled to it and they should not get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bjelke-Petersen spoke especially about rural women&mdash;farmers' wives and mothers. But what we did not hear from her was anything about the 15 per cent tax that they would pay on all the groceries, the kids' shoes and the kids' clothes. Members of the Opposition continue to demonstrate that they do not understand their own proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in this place Senator O'Chee was complaining, with some justification, that the existing wholesale sales tax is applied on the freight component of goods delivered to the country. If the wholesaler invoices the goods in that way, Senator O'Chee is correct: the wholesale sales tax, at whatever rate, is added not just to the cost of the goods ex-factory, wherever it is, but also to the cost of the freight to transport the goods to their retail destination. But what he obviously does not understand is that, once this value added tax were brought in, a 15 per cent tax would be applied, not only to the freight costs of the small minority of goods that are subject to a wholesale sales tax, but to the whole lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt whether Senator Boswell understands this either.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the Liberal and National parties' Fightback program has given strong hope at last to Australia's hard-pressed farmers, who are suffering more than those in any other sector in the community because of the current disastrous rural recession. That is why the following matter of public importance has been proposed today by Senator Archer and supported by Senator Bjelke-Petersen and me, on behalf of the coalition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hope given to Australian farmers by the Coalition's Fightback program as compared to the misery of Labor's recession and failure to implement the fundamental reforms necessary to give farmers a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only will our economic reform package restore viability to farms by providing very specific reductions in production costs for farmers, but our overall policies and reforms will give a boost to business generally and put our languishing economy back on track&mdash;something that this Labor Government has consistently failed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two key elements of farm viability and survival are, firstly, the input costs to produce a commodity and, secondly, the commodity's selling price. Time and time again this Hawke Labor Government has tried to explain away and wash its hands of the plight of Australian farmers on the basis of poor prices on overseas markets. We heard that again today from Minister Cook in his response to Senator Archer's opening of this debate. Of prices and costs, costs are the most significant. Detailed studies have shown that over 60 per cent of farm viability depends on domestic economic decisions&mdash;decisions which the present Hawke Labor Government, failing as it is, has continually avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has recently forecast that the average farmer will be drawing on savings or borrowings this year, not only to cover farm operating expenses, but also just to meet normal day-to-day family living expenses. In what other sector of our economy do workers actually work for less than zero income? This is happening in our rural sector to thousands of Australian farmers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the recent Outlook Conference held on 16 October this year, the Bureau made the following prediction:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By many measures, farm incomes in 1991/2 are expected to be the lowest on record.</PARA>
<PARA>Farmers in my own State of South Australia have been hit harder than those in other States. Although there has been a slight rise in wheat and beef prices, mostly at the expense of those farmers hit by the drought in New South Wales and Queensland, the Bureau concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outlook in the South Australian farm sector continues to be bleak.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bureau's figures highlight that the value of South Australia's rural produce fell by nearly one-quarter in the space of one year, while returns for some major commodities were halved, compared to a fall of just under 10 per cent Australia-wide. While farmers have been hit by drought, poor commodity prices and the international trade war, these are not the main reasons for their difficulties. It is the Labor Government's high interest rate policies and the failure to implement the reforms necessary to reduce costs that have plunged the agricultural sector into financial ruin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real interest rates are still high and many farmers in South Australia are still paying overdraft rates in the high teens and low twenties&mdash;considerably higher than the current prime lending rates available. While prices are falling, production costs are escalating and are further increased by wholesale sales tax of between $4 billion and $6 billion on industry and agricultural production costs, tax of $1.7 billion on exports and $6.8 billion of fuel excise. High transport costs for road and rail and on the waterfront are contributing to the rural sector's misery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties' Fightback program presents a thorough and comprehensive scheme to redress these problems which Labor is either unable or unwilling to face. Firstly, the coalition proposes that the removal of sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise will dramatically cut costs for farmers. These are taxes which, under this Labor Government, have to be paid, regardless of taxable income&mdash;and farmers pay them, even if indirectly. In contrast, the goods and services tax will be fully refundable on all goods and services used in farming activity, including on vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We live in a vast country and removal of fuel excise is one of the most significant and far-reaching reforms in the Fightback program because it affects every aspect of our economy and every sector of the community. However, for farmers, who are so reliant on transport for their very survival, it will have an even greater benefit. The present Labor Government has admitted that road transport is taxed 3 1/2 times more than other industries, yet it has done absolutely nothing about rectifying the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the coalition's package, however, farmers will not pay excise on petrol or diesel, whether it is for off or on farm use, and any goods and services tax on consumption which is for business purposes will be fully refunded. This will give farmers a total reduction in fuel tax of around 26c a litre for business purposes and 19c a litre for private use. This reduction in fuel costs applies equally to the trucking industry and to rail transport, so the costs of transporting farm goods to market will be reduced, as will be the costs of goods that farmers have to purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land transport, of course, is only one element affected by the removal of fuel excise. Farmers have other significant excise costs related to running the farm, such as reliance on aircraft for both transport and agricultural practices such as crop spraying. The costs for all of these will be reduced. As I mentioned earlier, the removal of wholesale sales tax will greatly benefit farmers because, despite a view to the contrary, farmers do pay wholesale sales tax on a whole range of items they buy, and the effective rate they pay is almost 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payroll tax too affects farmers, as it does everyone, even if they do not pay it directly themselves. The total payroll tax bill of $5.8 billion is a direct cost on, and a disincentive to, employment and, as a consequence, is passed on to the consumer. Labor governments have consistently refused to remove this iniquitous tax, while at the same time declaring the need for the creation of more employment. Instead, Labor policies have led to more than a quarter of a million people losing their jobs in the last 18 months, pushing the rate of unemployment over the 10 per cent mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In government, the coalition will actually do something about it, and removing payroll tax is just one element of getting Australia back on the road to recovery. In the meantime, those farmers who are hardest hit by the recession will be given real assistance under a coalition government. Where the current Labor Government has ignominiously meted out only superficial bandaid treatment to suffering rural families&mdash;and, again, we heard some of this from Senator Cook&mdash;the coalition has recognised their very real, immediate needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family allowance will be doubled for families with combined incomes below $30,000 and the family allowance supplement will be increased by 6 per cent. The assets test will be replaced by an income test in cases of extreme hardship for all family and welfare benefits as well as for Austudy recipients. In addition, the coalition has made a commitment to increase funding to voluntary non-government agencies by $50m to assist with family crisis care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who are fortunate to be earning enough income to pay income tax, personal income tax will be slashed by about 30 per cent by raising the tax free threshold and lowering marginal tax rates. The dependent spouse rebate for families with children will be increased to $1,679 and the remote area allowance and zone rebates will be increased by at least 25 per cent. The assets test will not apply to retirees who wish to retire on the family farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is a major expense for many farm families who have to send their children away to school. The goods and services tax will not apply to education and a basic 20 per cent grant for all non-government school pupils will be restored. There will be no assets test for isolated children's allowances and the means test free boarding allowance will be increased to $2,400&mdash;an increase of some 55 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the benefits of the coalition's Fightback economic package are spread across the whole community and farming families will benefit immeasurably. It is a sad reflection on this Labor Government that it has, for the past decade, deliberately promised more than it could ever deliver. So we will shortly see a change of government which will introduce significantly changed circumstances for Australia's farmers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Since the Hawke Government established the first national program to combat land degradation in 1983, Federal funding activities to rehabilitate degraded lands and to develop and promote practices that will lead to sustainable land management have increased from $1m to nearly $25m in 1991-92.

The Opposition tends to neglect, or omits to acknowledge, that overseas factors play some part in the primary production aspects and sale of produce from this country. The Opposition has failed to recognise what is happening to our wool in the USSR. The USSR has traditionally been one of Australia's large purchasers of Australian wool. The main bank in the USSR has been bought out&mdash;Russia is offering to bail it out. The USSR is in a state of huge crisis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the coalition's Fightback, or should I say `Frightpack', package. One of the key implications of this proposed GST is its inflationary impact. We have seen a number of figures touted around as to what this impact would be. One needs to think very carefully about who inflation impacts upon the most. It especially impacts upon low income households. It is quite obvious that currently farming families are low income households. Therefore, the major impact must be upon those families, those people with large families and those who are retired and living off their savings. These groups cannot adjust easily to the changes in price levels. They consume a large proportion of their disposable income. Many farmers would certainly fall into this category at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Opposition takes no notice of that. In fact, Senator Chapman talked about zero income for some farmers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know, as Senator Walsh pointed out, that, when there is inflation, one of the ways to cut it&mdash;the only way that would be left to the Opposition&mdash;is to hike up interest rates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had the Opposition attempting to divert attention from the whole GST picture and its `Frightpack' package by trying to focus upon the reduction in farm inputs.

Senator Bjelke-Petersen was very concerned about the effects upon women in primary production. I want her to know how the GST&mdash;or the VAT, I should say&mdash;will impact upon things such as the price of food for primary producers, the price of their vegetables, the price of their meat, the price of clothing for their children and the price of pens and paper that their children need to take to school.

<PARA>The Australia Council is a very important Council. Over $50m of Government funding for the arts goes through the Council. About $60m or so is allocated to the Australia Council and about $8m is involved in administrative expenses of one kind or another and in the undertaking of some functions which may or may not be appropriate to the Australia Council. Whether they are or not, the fact remains that about $8m of the funding to the Australia Council for the arts does not end up going to the arts or, at least, to arts groups in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, this means there are some controversies involved, as there will inevitably be, in the distribution of funding for the arts. In fact, we have seen in recent times some very critical remarks about the Australia Council from the Sydney Theatre Company, as well as criticism of it from the Australian Chamber Orchestra and from various arts groups in Melbourne. The Australian Ballet is also very keen to get the same kind of one-line funding, divorced from the Australia Council, as the Government has arranged for the Australian Opera. So, clearly, it would be wrong to suggest that all in the arts administration garden is lovely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent I must say that I commend the new Chairman of the Australia Council, Rodney Hall, for his recognition of the need to have a look at the way things are working and at the way things are being done. In the annual report he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present we are in the process of looking afresh at many of our policies in the light of the need to clarify our role, especially in relation to developments in other sources of public funding for the arts through State and local government bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend Mr Hall for recognising the need for that review because, as he knows&mdash;and we have discussed this at some length&mdash;the coalition is concerned about the cost of the duplicated bureaucracies that are involved in the present arrangements for the funding of the arts. Many arts organisations being funded by the Australia Council also receive funding from State organisations, and some also receive funding from local government organisations. So here we have multiple bureaucracies funding the same organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt, as is evidenced by our Fightback program in which we seek to reduce the administrative costs of funding the arts, that the coalition is determined to see that arts dollars go to arts people and not to competing bureaucracies. We are also of the strong view that arts dollars should be distributed on arts based criteria and not on other criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having looked through this annual report, I must say that it is quite disturbing to see the number of other activities that the Australia Council has taken unto itself which involve the expenditure of considerable sums of public money on matters not directly involving the funding of arts bodies. It may be that they are very useful functions; it may be that they are an unnecessary diversion of arts money into things which are not of importance and that the money could be better spent by arts organisations themselves. Of course, those judgments can be made only after properly examining the way that the Australia Council conducts itself. Under the coalition that sort of examination will take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I am inclined to the view that the Australia Council's most useful function is in distributing grants to individuals and that it is not useful for it to duplicate the activities of, particularly, State governments in its grants to organisations and bodies such as the Sydney Theatre Company, for example, which is objecting to the nature of its control. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The annual report of the Australian Federal Police is one of the better and more comprehensive reports that have been tabled in the Senate. The report gives a very comprehensive overview in considerable detail of the functions and aims of the Australian Federal Police, the way in which it pursues its objectives and the way in which its functions are being carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following three days of the AIDEX exhibition and related protests, I have some specific interest in matters relating to the Australian Federal Police. In the short time available to me, I have examined the report looking for some trace of training of personnel for dealing with demonstrations and civil disobedience protests&mdash;tasks that the Federal Police carried out during the AIDEX protests. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless it is contained under some other heading, I have been unable to find such a reference in this report. I wish to put on record my concern that this is so. I believe that this is a matter that needs to be followed up. As I have foreshadowed, I will ask the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) to hold an inquiry as a first step in the preparation of a general agreement on some code of conduct to be followed by both protesters and police. I trust that this will now receive some higher priority in the activities of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the somewhat critical comments I have made in the past, I wish to take this opportunity to also put on record an incident at the end of AIDEX in which the Australian Federal Police was involved and which throws a different light on its personnel. One protester used eleven 44-gallon drums rather colourfully decorated with peace slogans and other graphic motives to take part in the protests. These were thrown behind a cyclone fence by the police. At the end of the three days, the owner, Mr Benny Zable, asked for these drums to be returned. I went with him, met with the sergeant of police and, after some friendly negotiation, that sergeant detailed 11 members of his force to retrieve the drums from behind the fence and have them carried around the building and deposited for protesters to take away. I believe that this was a very fitting and positive conclusion to the protests at the AIDEX site. I wished I had had a camera. It was beautiful to see 11 policemen each carrying a 44-gallon drum decorated with peace symbols. I believe that it augurs well for the inquiry and the future negotiations towards a conduct of civil disobedience demonstrations so that we can not only protect our community's civil rights but also allow the police in a reasonable way to pursue their law enforcement duties. </PARA>

The original Bill, which sought to ban at all times, 365 days of the year, any paid political advertisements on radio and television, was introduced into the Senate on 4 June. The original Bill had some 23 clauses and was guillotined through the House of Representatives prior to the winter recess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have yet again seen the outrageous use of the guillotine. Here we have a piece of legislation which seeks to limit freedom of political expression and freedom of speech in this country, yet the Government saw fit to guillotine the Bill. Not only are those opposite to be castigated for this sort of thing but also, and more importantly, the Australian Democrats who have supported them. It is patently obvious that the Democrats have dumped on their new senator, Senator Sowada, who, on behalf of the Democrats, gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures that the Australian Democrats recognise the need to contain costs and minimise corruption&mdash;with which, I might say, no-one would disagree&mdash;but were opposed outright to any ban on political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason the Democrats have a new Leader in this place is that the previous Leader did a deal with Senator Bolkus to support political advertising. In other words, they were prepared to trade democracy for self-interest. I might say that they have not changed their spots one bit, but they have dumped on their new senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At about this time last year I asked the Minister, Senator Bolkus, whether the Executive Director of the Labor Party, Mr Bob Hogg, had directed the Government to introduce legislation to ban paid political advertising on television and radio. I further asked him since when unelected Party officials had got to the stage of telling this Government what to do. Senator Bolkus responded that no such legislation was planned or being drafted&mdash;just 12 months ago. So much for the honesty of this Government. It is obviously following in the footsteps of its own Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who has a record of having stated that he has lied to the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are not dumb. It was absolutely transparent. This should be called the Hogg Bill. It should be called the Hogg Bill for two reasons. It was promoted by Mr Hogg, the unelected Party apparatchik, and the net result is that it puts the snout of the Labor Party more into the trough of the public purse. It is looking to get more money not only from the taxpayer, but also from sources such as the beleaguered television stations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original Bill, as I mentioned, was to ban at all times all political advertising on radio and television&mdash;365 days of the year. It applied not only to political parties but also to any interest groups in the community. No advertisement could contain any matter which referred to any present or past political party or the actions of a party. No advertisement would be permitted which included matter intended, or likely, to affect voting at any future Commonwealth, State or local government election. In part 3, tacked on the end, were a few clauses relating to disclosures of donations to political parties&mdash;four clauses out of 23. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this hogwash&mdash;all this nonsense&mdash;from the Minister and the Government about corruption is absolutely phoney. The coalition made its position crystal clear from the outset and we have not deviated from those principles and do not intend to deviate. Firstly, we would not accept any proposition whatsoever which sought to limit in any way freedom of political expression or freedom of speech in this country. There could be no compromise on a matter which struck at the very heart of democracy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note from Senator Cook's interjection that he does not even understand this. What Senator Cook is not saying is that this Government, which has been totally discredited with its handling of the economy and has brought this country to its knees, is not averse to going back and putting its snout in the trough simply to promote itself at the next election without having to seek funds elsewhere. It is going to the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the interjection I mentioned two principles. One was that we would not support in any way anything that sought to limit freedom of political expression, and the second was that we would support disclosure of donations provided all parties were treated fairly and equitably, there was protection against coercion of a prospective donor and there was protection against discrimination of a donor to a political party by a hostile government or a third party once that donation had been made known. I noticed in the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures that Senator Schacht tried to discredit that proposition, but anyone&mdash;any human being&mdash;knows that that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of that position, Dr Hewson wrote to the Prime Minister asking that the Bill be split. At the same time, I approached the then Leader of the Democrats with a similar request. The Prime Minister refused, adopting the Senator Bolkus line that the bans on advertising and disclosure were related. Senator Powell also refused the request, again adopting the Senator Bolkus line. I subsequently moved in the Senate on 20 June that the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs during the winter recess. This was rejected by the Labor Government and the Democrats. They did not want the content of that Bill aired in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was of concern to the Opposition that the general public did not know what was in the Bill. It is not surprising; no-one in the community would have imagined that a government of this country would introduce such an outrageous Bill. Community groups were informed of its contents by the Opposition and a task force was established under the able chairmanship of my colleague Senator Olsen to conduct its own inquiries. The evidence, with one exception, was overwhelmingly in favour of opposing the ban on advertising because it attacked, in a most unprecedented way, freedom of speech in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats were prepared to sacrifice freedom of speech. Senator Powell subsequently wrote to me and requested that we agree to refer the Bill to a committee&mdash;a born again&mdash;a proposal that she had previously rejected. The reason she made the proposal, of course, was that she was under attack because of the position she had taken of sacrificing her principles simply for self-interest. By this time, the ground swell of opposition in this country was of such magnitude that only a committee of inquiry to look at all aspects of the Bill would be satisfactory. We were delighted to see that, because it supported what we had tried to do prior to the winter recess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party appointed as the Committee's chairman an ex-Party apparatchik, ex-State secretary of the ALP, Senator Schacht.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the conclusion reached by the Labor majority on this Select Committee called into question the integrity of the committee system. It was a farce. One has only to read the evidence. The conclusion was quite clearly predetermined, which meant that a lot of genuine Australian citizens and community groups wasted an awful lot of time and money preparing submissions. It meant that a lot of taxpayers' money was wasted getting people to Canberra to give evidence. It meant that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> wasted its time, as did the able support staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has a long history of pulling these stunts. The last one in which I was involved, with a similar outcome, was the inquiry into Sydney Airport. Today the Minister, Senator Collins, signed a majority report opposing the building of the third runway. When I raised it with him and said, `I never expected that you, of all people, would sign a report like that', his response was, `You don't want to stand in the way of a potentially brilliant political career'. He followed the Party line; he did not listen to the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made a remark in this Senate at the time that, if that was indicative of the dishonesty which permeated members of the Labor Party on committees, I would not waste my time in the future going on a committee. As I said, it put the whole integrity of the Committee system at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 127 submissions were received by that Committee and 38 witnesses appeared before it. From the weight of evidence it was quite apparent that the ban on advertising should have been abandoned altogether and that fair and equitable treatment of donors was required. In addition, notwithstanding comments in the report, discrimination should have been addressed. I notice that, while even the majority Labor report acknowledged that, no attempt has been made in any of the amendments before the Committee to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate on the Select Committee report, Government speakers questioned why I personally put the coalition case at the inquiry. I know this is difficult for the Labor Party because of the control exercised over it by shadowy non-elected figures and the ACTU. But I made it clear that policy is determined by the coalition&mdash;by the Liberal Party&mdash;by elected members and senators who are ultimately responsible to the electors. The Labor Party, of course, is not. I remember well the leader of the Australian Workers Union in Queensland threatening elected members that if they supported the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) in his leadership bid<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> they would be politically dead.

Other witnesses who appeared included the Federal directors of both the Liberal and National parties, notwithstanding remarks made here by people such as Senator Aulich who intimated only last week that they did not appear or that they had to be forced to appear. Nothing could be further from the truth. It simply reflects the attitude of those opposite to the Senate Select Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has now decided it will adopt a back to the wall approach, a desperate measure by a desperate and failed government. It has shown it is totally incapable of managing its own budget, in the same way as it has shown itself to be totally incapable of managing the Australian economy. Is it any wonder that we are in serious economic difficulties in Australia today? If it cannot organise its own budget, how can it organise and manage the Budget of the economy of Australia? Because of its inability to control its own finances, it is in financial difficulties with its Federal Secretariat in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Canberra it has sold 34 per cent of John Curtin House to a group which initially was called `Second Ox-Tail Pty Ltd'. Have honourable senators ever heard a name like that? It is a subsidiary of the ACTU. Subsequently, that name has come under the direct control of the ACTU. The ACTU bought 34 per cent of John Curtin House for $4m. In New South Wales, the Labor Party managed to invest $3.8m in a building in Sussex Street, which has run it into debt to the tune of $7m. It is pretty brilliant stuff to be able to convert an investment of $3.8m into a debt of $7m. It puts the ALP in the same league as Estate Mortgage and Christopher Skase and all the other failed entrepreneurs. The difference is that the Labor Party has not only failed itself in the mismanagement of its financial affairs but also destroyed the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is opposed to compulsion. This Bill is all about compulsion. It wants to compel television stations, which have been through enormous difficulties&mdash;some are still in the hands of liquidators&mdash;to provide free time. We are opposed to that. It raises a whole lot of questions. If we request a television station to provide free time for political parties, why not ask the advertising agencies? Why not go next to the newspapers, and so on? People would argue&mdash;and I would be one of them&mdash;that this is the probable next step. It is only a matter of time before the Labor Party and the Democrats will come back into this place and say, `Listen, we have done all this, but the cost of running elections is still very expensive. It costs some thousands of dollars for a one-page advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>.

It also compels taxpayers to contribute to political parties, and we are opposed to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition stated that it would support disclosure provided there was adequate protection against coercion and intimidation, and provided all donors to all political parties were treated equitably. I do not think anybody can argue with that proposition. The claim was made by Senator Schacht that no tangible proof was presented with regard to coercion and intimidation. Mr Andrew Robb, who gave evidence, refused to give specific details on intimidation. Why? The answer is very simple: because it would have been a breach of faith to individuals who genuinely feared intimidation. It is very real. I see Senator Beahan laughing over there. With his background with the trade union movement, he would know what intimidation is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht claims to be the great exponent of civil liberties and human rights; he is forever standing up in here and speaking about Myanmar and South Africa.

He got the blessing of the trade unions and his tutor at the University of Queensland because he was going to do his PhD on the effects of the SEQEB strike on the people in Queensland who had been put out of work. He was welcomed because the trade unions thought, `Here is one of us. He will give us a great story'. I presume that is why Mr Sherry was called before the inquiry. But it backfired because it turned out, according to the evidence of Mr Sherry, that when he got among the union books and looked at the minutes he found incredible scams where money that had been handed in for the strikers had been diverted by the ALP into election campaign funds for ALP members.

I can recall commenting on it in this chamber at that time because I thought it was strange that that sort of warning notice would be given of the imposition of a tax which enabled people to high-grade resources. I might say that this is not the way to husband resources in this country. Of course, we now know the reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also say that it is a human reaction to take a dislike to someone who contributes to another political party and to view with suspicion the reason for that donation. It is a human reaction. All I am saying is that intimidation is a real thing and we must ensure that the amendments to this legislation are such that they protect people against coercion and intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point relates to what is meant by `fair and equitable'. The Australian Labor Party is the political arm of the trade union movement. The majority of funds provided to the Labor Party come from the trade unions in two forms. The first is by way of affiliation fees. The question is often asked, `Why do the trade unions affiliate with the Labor Party?'. Someone interjected here earlier about the Cooke report. Honourable senators should read the Cooke report because it points out why the Federated Clerks Union of Australia affiliated with the ALP at a cost to members of $30,000 a year or $2.05 to $2.10 per head. At a meeting with Premier Goss it was claimed that this was done because it enabled the union to influence government policy and have ready access to Ministers. That is the very thing that I have heard Senator Bolkus claim is a problem with the Liberal Party. That is why the Clerks Union affiliated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second form is by way of donations. In both cases the Labor Party has the benefit of obtaining what is virtually tax free money. Union dues are tax deductible. Therefore, any affiliation fees come from tax deductible moneys. Donations from the trade union movement are of a tax-free nature. It is not generally recognised in the community that all income received by trade unions is tax-free money. A trade union would pay no tax even if it owned, for example, the Gold Coast Casino, or a slab of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a trade union sells a major building which it owns in the central business district of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth, it does not pay capital gains tax. In my own home State of Queensland and, presumably, in other States, the unions are absolved from paying land tax. They pay none of the taxes that are charged to the ordinary person involved in a commercial enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Labor Party has this kick start, this head start to everyone else, it is apparent that the only way to move to levelling the playing field in regard to donations to other political parties is to permit tax deductibility of donations to political parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everybody on the Opposition benches seems to ignore the fact that this debate has been going on for an awfully long time. It has been going on in this Parliament for roughly four years and it has been going on for a lot longer in the more general political sphere, as anybody who has been around long enough will recall. But one could be forgiven for thinking that nothing has changed since the initial report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters first examined this issue. The same sort of rhetoric is being used as if a total ban were being proposed. This is despite the fact that the amendments to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill are proposing something quite different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals emanating from the report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, from the Government response to that report, from the initial legislation, from the Select Committee and its report and from the current amendments to the initial legislation have been variously described by the Opposition as draconian, a threat to democracy and an attack on the basic right of freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those comments are delivered by Opposition members with all the self-righteous fervour of people who really believe that the proposals mark the end of civilisation as we know it and that they alone are above reproach when it comes to the difficult question, the vexed question, of political fundraising. But those comments ring hollow for those of us who have followed the Opposition responses to electoral reform over the years&mdash;an Opposition which has opposed all attempts at reform, not just in this area but in almost every other significant area of electoral reform. They ring hollow for those of us who know about the fundraising record of the Liberal Party of Australia and, more particularly, the National Party in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Opposition has steadfastly refused to recognise the basic problem which was the subject of the initial report, has been the subject of the inquiry of the Select Committee into the Bill and is the subject of these amendments to the Bill now before the Senate. The problem remains one of pressing concern to all who care about the integrity of the political system, which members of the Opposition appear not to. It is against this background that their protests are so much humbug. I take no notice of them. I urge anybody who is bored enough to be watching this debate to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us firstly look at what this Bill and the amendments are trying to do. We need to be aware of what the Bill is now proposing. Some of the comments that have been made appear to have been directed either at the original proposal, at what the report of the Joint Committee proposed or at what the Select Committee proposed. This amended Bill is proposing full disclosure of all political donations. That part of it has not changed; it has been a consistent part of the Bill since it was introduced. In fact, it was recommended by the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes the provision of limited free time on commercial and national TV and radio networks, to be funded by those networks as a community service obligation. The free time is for the provision of information in a talking heads style with ads to be run concurrently on all stations. The idea of concurrent viewing is so that the costs overall will be reduced both for the ABC and for the commercial networks. The proposal is similar to current arrangements in both France and England, except for the concurrent running of the ads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has taken up the broad thrust of the Joint Committee's report and some of the specific recommendations of the Select Committee. The Bill is proposed against a backdrop of an emerging problem, which has two elements. The first is the exponential increase in the costs of campaigning and the second is the potential for corruption as parties are forced to meet these increasing costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an indication of the nature of cost increases, the cost to political parties of TV and radio advertising between the 1984 and the 1987 Federal Elections rose by 137 per cent while public funding, which is indexed and related to the CPI, rose by only 31.9 per cent. In other words, we are facing a situation where the costs of television, in particular, and radio advertising are rising exponentially far faster than the CPI and far faster than public funding where public funding in fact exists. </PARA>

On current prices, a 60-second advertisement in a prime time spot on Sydney TV costs about $12,000, and in fact can cost a lot more under certain circumstances. At the last election, the political parties jointly spent over $19m on broadcast advertising. These figures are staggering but, on overseas experience, they are likely to get worse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal Party has yet to be inquired into; that is the final part of the inquiry. Senator Panizza should not smile too much yet, because that is still to come. While all of this may be of no concern to the Opposition, it is of grave concern to thinking people in Australia&mdash;people who worry about the integrity of the political process. It is for example, of grave concern to Tony Fitzgerald who said this in his report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is an urgent need to consider establishing a public register of political donations. Lack of such a register has given rise to community suspicion and lack of confidence in the political process.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also of great concern to the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales where ICAC Commissioner Rodin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So long as substantial donations can be made to political parties or candidates without disclosure, they can be used to purchase influence. The law that allows secret political donations, creates conditions conducive to corrupt conduct.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>he is recognising there the element of cost, which Senator Parer seems to reject out of hand&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the problem will grow. It must be faced and dealt with firmly and openly. To allow large secret donations to political parties or candidates is but one step removed from allowing secret deals with political parties or candidates.</PARA>
<PARA>Against this background the Joint Committee, then later on the Select Committee, and the Government concluded that there is an obvious and urgent need for full and effective disclosure of all political donations. But that in itself is not enough. There is also a need to curb in some way the pressure for the exponential increase in campaign costs which are a feature particularly of those democracies which permit the unregulated use of TV and radio political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case for disclosure has been put by Fitzgerald and Rodin&mdash;I have already quoted from them&mdash;but perhaps more importantly common sense and I believe public opinion demand it. There is also a need to apply such disclosure in a way which prevents abuses such as have occurred in the United States where political action committees have burgeoned as a way of getting around attempts at regulating political fundraising following the Watergate scandal. Political action committees have been set up to avoid that regulation. The abuse is even more blatant in New South Wales&mdash;it is not atypical of the Liberal Party's approach to this whole question&mdash;where a company, Community Polling, was set up in order to blatantly disregard the New South Wales disclosure laws by laundering money to independent candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing that whenever or wherever, and for that matter in whatever form, disclosure is proposed it is opposed by the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg your pardon. I will do that in future. The public has a right to know who is funding future governments and those who have influence through positions in Parliament. It is not exclusively an issue of the Left: Barry Goldwater, that doyen of the extreme right in the United States, in commenting on what he saw as public concerns arising out of the Watergate scandal said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not. . . the people. . . but moneyed interests who are setting the nation's political agenda and are influencing the position of candidates on the important issues of the day.</PARA>
<PARA>Even John Hewson has supported disclosure, although he has equivocated under pressure from some of his Party's apparatchiks within the Party proper. Initially, Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My disposition is to support disclosure and you know, as long as it is done in an equitable fashion, and in those terms, you know, I've so far not had to comment very much on that particular item of the decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he flipped from that position and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am worried about the use of disclosure rules, the information that comes. . . as a basis for intimidation.</PARA>
<PARA>That picks up Senator Parer's position. I do not know whether Senator Parer or Andrew Robb saw Dr Hewson, but somebody got to him. Later, he flipped again and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have said it very clearly, that my disposition is, of course, in favour of disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill has made similar comments, saying that his predisposition is towards disclosure. When Dr Hewson and Senator Hill have said that, they have made no comment about intimidation, which is one of those shibboleths which Senator Parer and other members of the Liberal Party consistently raise, despite the fact that there is no proof of it and they have been unable to raise any proof, despite their attempts to do so. The attention of the Senate needs to be drawn to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that everything that Senator Parer and others are saying is suffused with paranoia about unions. He says that they are the major source of fundraising for the Labor Party. They are not. They are a very minor source of fundraising for the Labor Party, and a diminishing one. It is a source which has been diminishing for a number of years now. It is rather like the claims that are made ad nauseam by Senator Bishop and others every time we have an inquiry into an election&mdash;about cemetery voting and multiple voting. They make the claims, but they have never yet come up with the evidence. In the case of intimidation, they have not come up with the evidence. They failed to come up with the evidence in front of the Select Committee. They have failed in this, just as they have in all of the other claims that they have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to curb the increasing costs of campaigning, particularly the costs relating to television. I have already indicated the nature of those cost increases. The effect of this is to cut out individuals and most community groups from the political process. At the last election $1.75m was spent by all third parties on television and radio political advertising&mdash;only $60,000 of this was spent by community groups. The normal rule of thumb&mdash;I was a State secretary of the ALP once, so I have some idea of this&mdash;is that, unless on current rates you spend $100,000, you do not get the reach and frequency necessary to have any sort of impact at all on television, so many of those community groups have wasted their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly means that many of those groups are unable to be part of the political process. It means that money, not people, is setting the political agenda. In this regard, it is nonsense to talk about the Government's proposal being an attack on free speech. There is nothing free about television advertising, as I have already indicated. Clearly, only the wealthy can afford it and only the wealthy, therefore, can afford the sort of freedom talked about in such pious terms by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is never conceded by anyone in the Opposition that in the whole question of political advertising Australia, with its current lack of regulation, is the odd one out. There is nothing unusual about it; there is nothing unique about the Government's attempts to provide some sort of regulation to prevent the potentially dangerous abuses of the political system. Regulation is the norm in comparable developed democracies; it is not the exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 19 comparable countries that were looked at by the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters and the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures only four permit paid political advertising. One of them&mdash;Canada&mdash;limits it to the campaign period, but the rest of them have bans of various sorts. Does the Opposition really believe that John Major's England&mdash;or for that matter, Margaret Thatcher's England&mdash;is undemocratic; or that Mitterrand's France is undemocratic; or that Sweden, Austria, Italy, Norway or Denmark have draconian laws? Yet all of these countries limit in some way, or ban outright, political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the USA, which permits political advertising, has laws regulating the prices charged to political parties&mdash;something which might have been a good idea before the networks started taking political parties for a ride, as they have done over the last few years. Recently there have been renewed cries in the USA for further regulation of fundraising, of political advertising, following the abuse of earlier attempts, following Watergate, to cap expenditure&mdash;attempts which have been undermined by the growth of political action committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Opposition argues that these actions are being proposed because the ALP is broke. The ALP has always supported disclosure, not only of political donations but also of MPs' pecuniary interests. Both have been consistently opposed by conservative parties, Federal and State. While the ALP is under financial restraint from the many elections that it has had to face so, too, are all other political parties. I suggest that the Liberal Party and the National Party are in a lot worse trouble than is the ALP. The ALP is not broke. It will be able to fund the next election and it will be able to fund elections in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, honourable senators opposite should not forget that the ALP, through this very decision, is denying itself an advantage that it had over the other political parties. In successive elections since 1983 we have consistently beaten the Opposition hands down in the area of television advertising. The proposition that we exclusively are broke is a furphy put around to distract attention from the fact that the Opposition is nervous about disclosing who gives it money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has introduced this Bill, firstly, to provide a clean political system free from undue influence and the potential for bribery; secondly, to provide a level playing field so that all people can participate in the political process; and, thirdly, to ensure that bank balances do not set political agendas and that the impact of secret donations is reduced.

Further amendments are placed on the table at this hour of the night&mdash;6 o'clock&mdash;and the Government expects other political parties to have looked at the Bill plus the amendments, made a judgment on them and proceeded to have their own amendments drafted as a result of that. It is inefficiency and incompetence to the fore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is before the House clearly for the purposes of overcoming the quite difficult financial circumstances of the Australian Labor Party. That is the core of the problem. We are here to debate, and I hope stop, the Federal Government's manipulation of the democratic electoral processes of this country for its own party ends. It is doing so quite brazenly; it is doing so without any compunction; it shows no concern for those it will disadvantage or for the democratic process of free speech which it will cripple. It is displaying for all to see that we have a socialist government in power which totally lacks social conscience, capacity, ability and competence to get a Bill before this Parliament right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is certainly a first for Australia and a first step away from true democracy. Until now, Australia has set a proud example of democracy to the world. One has only to witness the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have come out here over the years and sought our democratic shelter from communist regimes and dictatorships. These people sadly learned the hard way the value of freedom of speech; of the right to be politically informed; of the necessity of not stifling political debate; and of the effects of being without such protections. They understand the true benefits that come from a free democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is an example of how the abuse of power, created by a desperation to hold on to that power&mdash;that is what the migrants overseas walked away from; they came to Australia to get away from that type of country, that type of system&mdash;can turn the resources of a decaying government to attempting the passage of manipulative, unprincipled legislation. I say this because, while public debate over the issue has raged for most of this year now, the real reason for the legislation has never been in doubt. I wish to add here that when I say `public debate has raged', I mean that the community and the constitutional lawyers, the Human Rights Commissioner and the Law Council of Australia have raged against this Bill, while the Government alone has kept pushing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason we are debating such an appalling piece of legislation&mdash;there are 37 amendments to the original Bill and further amendments to this legislation have been put on file within the last 10 minutes&mdash;is that, purely and simply, the Labor Party is more than a little short of money. That is the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we had revealed to us late last week, with the help of Senator Loosley, that the New South Wales branch of the ALP is technically insolvent with debts of some $7m. That is a lot of prime time television advertising, I might add. All around the country, the Labor Party is on the nose coping with the desertion of many of its major donors, given the policy direction it has taken; the cost it has inflicted on small, medium and large business; and the destruction of jobs in this country. The bread and butter campaign fodder&mdash;the donations of the trade unionists&mdash;has also fallen away as union membership drops to just 31 per cent of the working population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not misunderstand what this is all about. The ALP, the political wing of the union movement&mdash;the Australian Labor Party was formed by the trade union movement to be its political wing&mdash;has contracting membership down to 31 per cent. Donors are walking away and closing up their cheque books. I am sure everyone would understand why it is doing that. So, quite cynically, this Government has suddenly decided that elections are too expensive to fight by the present rules and Australians are asked to swallow that the Government, unexpectedly seeing the light with all the fervour of a born-again Christian, has nothing at all to do with its coffers being empty. That is really starting to test and stretch the imagination. That is about as believable as the tooth fairy, the Easter bunny and Father Christmas all rolled into one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course elections cost all parties far more than they would wish them to. All parties would appreciate less expensive campaigns. However, this side of the chamber is definitely not prepared to throw out something as critical as freedom of speech in a probably useless attempt to achieve such a result. Only the Hawke Government is determined to take this path by banning all paid electronic political advertising during Federal, State and local government elections and by-elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To even the most trusting of people, surely this is a highly suspicious and most hypocritical move from a government which has ploughed hundreds of thousands of dollars into electronic advertising, increasingly outspending other major parties in the area? In the last Federal election campaign, which party increased its electronic advertising more than any other political party? Members of the Labor Party did. What hypocrites, given their track record last year, to be in this House now proposing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has come to its decision despite much evidence before the Senate Select Committee that campaign costs will most probably remain at the same high level and whatever funds are available will simply be directed to direct mail, print media and telemarketing. So the picture is quite clear. This legislation is a very sudden and far from altruistic decision of the Labor Government. It did not ever hint that it considered electronic political advertising had made previous campaigns too expensive. No, it was far too busy having the commercials produced to keep raising the amount spent in this very area, in contrast to other major parties which are shown to have either contained or reduced their budget allocation for electronic advertising. That is in the report presented to this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no doubt, if the Labor Party had the available funds at this moment it would far outspend us again at the next election using its usual massive amount of electronic advertising. If it had the money, it would not be putting this legislation before this House. But it does not have the money, which is the reason for this blatant attempt at changing the rules. In an attempt to muddy the waters, the Government coated the advertising legislation ban with some disclosure clauses and then refused to split the Bill when it was pointed out that the two subject areas stood alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the sight of the Government jumping up and down saying that they were linked to bring an end to political corruption. Unfortunately for the Government, it could produce no evidence of proven Federal political corruption, which apparently so needed stamping out to cut campaign costs, and introducing an advertising ban was the only way, and it did not deliver disclosure laws strong enough or wide enough to stamp out any such corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we wound our way through the Select Committee hearings, it became abundantly clear that the Government's disclosure proposals were no less cynical than the advertising ban proposal. Disclosure the Labor way is farcical. It naturally leaves the unions and the ALP still hidden from view, with the tax advantage inherent in the union movement there to soothe the ALP's way, while union members&mdash;despite only 44 per cent of them voting for ALP&mdash;are to remain forced to contribute to it, without ever knowing what percentage of their union levy makes its way into campaign funds. </PARA>

There is no tax deductibility clause for all donors to political parties, which would go some way to levelling the playing field against tax deductible union contributions. There is no attempt to have the Auditor-General, for example, spot audit third parties involved in the political process who receive government grants. So there has been no attempt to ensure that governments do not provide taxpayers' funds to third parties to campaign on their behalf.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government had been fair dinkum about corruption, the disclosure laws would have been drafted far wider than they have been thus far. The penalties would have been far more effective than they are currently. That is the way in which the Government should have focused its attention on corruption of the political process, not by trying to artificially link in a political advertising ban. To save itself it has to eradicate the perceived advantage of the coalition, which is likely to attract a far greater level of donations and aid because of its winning approach&mdash;the Fightback approach it will take to the next election campaign. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that next time around there will be more people out there willing to support the coalition than the Labor Party&mdash;and well the Labor Party knows it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is proposed by the Government is not as severe as a total ban on electronic advertising, but it is vital that it be understood that it is still an attack on free speech. Neither the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, nor experts in constitutional law have backed away from that point. Third party organisations such as the RAA, the Real Estate Institute and the environmental lobby are totally banned from canvassing their views on the performance of political parties during campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should the AMA not be able to put its point of view on some policy issues in the health area? Why should the NRMA not be able to put its point of view in relation to policies affecting motorists in this country? That is not looking after single, main vested interest groups. Those bodies represent tens of thousands and in some instances hundreds of thousands of individuals who pay a membership fee to belong to an organisation that can represent their view. Why should the NRMA, the AMA, the RAA or whatever organisation that has a wide, in-depth membership not be entitled to put a policy point of view in a free, democratic society and argue its case? What is the Government so frightened of that makes it want to shut the door so that those bodies and organisations cannot participate in the electoral process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes which have been made to the Bill mean that the ban, which was to operate for 365 days a year, will now apply only to election periods. However, as an example of this, in 1988 in New South Wales, by the time we add up Commonwealth, State, local elections and by-elections, there would be no advertisements for something like 16 to 20 weeks of that year. So this nonsense about the ban being applied for only four weeks a year is exactly that&mdash;a nonsense. The fact is that this ban is far more wide reaching than the Government wants us to believe, or the perception that it wants to set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this ban allows the State to dictate exactly how political information is to be communicated to the electorate through the electronic media. It removes the right of political parties to choose the content and the timeframe of their advertising. It removes the right to choose the frequency of the time slots, and even the placement of them. A crucial factor in advertising reach is having the right demographics; otherwise it is a waste of time. If we want to communicate with one particular section of the electorate, the demographics are important in targeting and directing a message to the people to whom we want to communicate. The Government's roadblock approach removes that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also legislates to force commercial television networks to screen this State-controlled free time. It makes it far from free for them. Over recent years across Australia, we have seen television networks suffering financial struggles. The Government seeks to add to their worries by insisting that they provide the valued commodity of space for nothing, space for which they could be earning much needed dollars. It is quite a ludicrous situation, especially when the print media, direct mail, billboard agencies and telemarketing agencies will be receiving a revenue bonanza at the electronic media's expense as campaign funds are diverted from one area to another. Witness after witness before the Select Committee confirmed the fact that this action will not save total expenditure of dollars. It will be diverted to different areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commercial networks have in fact offered political parties reduced rate advertising. That offer has been ignored. They came before us and said, `Okay, if you want to try to contain the costs of electronic advertising, we will sell advertising space at reduced rates', as happens in many countries, for example, the US. The Government's proposal totally ignores that offer, yet it was eminently sensible. It begs the question why. Why would it ignore an offer from the commercial networks for cheaper rates in advertising? That is not a particularly difficult question, of course, given the current political situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having worked out that it is necessary to ban electronic advertising because Labor has no money, it seems that Labor has also decided it needs to be banned to avoid a memories campaign detailing the economic devastation of Labor. I could well see a coalition advertisement detailing the policy decisions of the past eight years and the havoc that those decisions have inflicted on Australians, but the Government wants to close the shutters on that. It does not want people to be reminded of its activities and its actions. So the networks pay the price which, in the economic crisis created by Labor, is likely to be a very heavy one for those networks. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, nothing in the Government's legislation, to any significant degree, helps the plight of the more than two million print handicapped; the migrants who can understand but who cannot read English; or the many rural communities that rely almost totally on the electronic media&mdash;particularly radio&mdash;for news and information services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report of the Committee accepted in part a carefully constructed proposal of the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia to use the parliamentary broadcast network and public radio to broadcast 90-minute loops of party political information during campaigns. But the Committee report did not think that proposal through. The NFBCA itself said that any ban on radio was a problem and that its members did not want to be tied down to specific narrow broadcast times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report of the Committee did not take into consideration some of the rural areas which have trouble with parliamentary broadcast reception, or the lack of public radio stations across Australia. The report was a quick hit attempt to quieten vocal and articulate critics of the ad ban, such as the NFBCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not government for the people; it is government against the people, with a few carrots tossed along the way. It is sad that this Government has been so overwhelmingly destructive that it has not been able to concede the intrinsic value of radio to so many groups in the community. Where is the sense, given that radio is cheaper than the print media? The evidence before the Select Committee demonstrated clearly that, in terms of audience reach, advertising on radio is far cheaper than taking out full-page or half-page advertisements in large daily newspapers, such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, and other publications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federation of Radio Broadcasters proved beyond doubt just how much cheaper radio advertising was, sometimes even in the capital cities, than the print media and direct mail. Only one witness before the Select Committee&mdash;Phillip Adams&mdash;put the point of view that radio should be included in the ban. He put forward the argument that image advertising would move from television to radio if it were not. The argument was such that it obviously could not be sustained. Yet because it fitted the Government's agenda, it was latched onto with alacrity and now we see it repeated as gospel. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are dealing with a situation where we have legislation which meets with widespread condemnation within the Australian community. Of more than 100 submissions to the Select Committee, only seven had anything supportive to say about the legislation. The legislation is in this chamber, not for the reasons of corruption which the Government so loves to peddle, but for reasons of near bankruptcy of both Labor Party funds and ideas on how to continue to cling to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To show any support for this legislation is to condone the abuse of power by this Government. The Democrats have sworn to `keep the b's honest'. This legislation is an opportunity to prove what they mean. While, as a party, they may feel somewhat appeased by the Government's back down from a total ban to free time and talking heads, the free time is far from free to the greatly disadvantaged media groups. It is far from providing freedom of access to political information by the disadvantaged in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even more important than those crucial issues is the fact that this legislation is not legislation for Australia. It is not designed to protect the political process&mdash;to keep it pure, as I heard one Labor member say. It is none of that. It is legislation which makes a mockery of what we are here for. It is legislation for the benefit of one political party&mdash;the Labor Party, and only the Labor Party. No-one else receives any benefit or any worth from this. If this legislation passes through the Senate, we are stamping our approval on party manipulation of the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, it is manipulation purely for financial ends: to help Labor balance its sick accounts and to make the next election cost less for the Labor Party. A side benefit is that it thereby denies other political parties, community groups and organisations the opportunity to express their views on the political process through the most successful medium available to them: the right to communicate the message of one's choice through the medium of one's choice and the right of people to receive the message of their choice from the medium of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not here to serve the Labor Party and its vested interests and we will let down thousands of Australians if we allow this twisted rationale to succeed. No-one would disagree about disclosure, and the coalition parties have supported the principle of full, fair and equitable disclosure. This situation was brought about by the Labor Party, which was so embarrassed about Western Australia Inc. that it decided it was appropriate in this climate to move in this direction. It was financially bankrupt and it was being embarrassed in Western Australia. As a result of that, it decided to move in this direction in order to demonstrate and set the perception that it was moving, that it was coming to grips with the problem. But it is not. It is infringing the rights of freedom of speech and infringing the rights of democracy within Australia.

This evening I want to readdress some of the issues that I raised on those occasions and put them in the context of the dissenting minority report of the Opposition members on the Select Committee, Senators Olsen and Kemp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do so, I would like to restate the underlying principle which over recent years has guided my particular interest in the problems addressed by this legislation. I believe I can do this in no better way than by quoting from Elizabeth Drew's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Politics and Money: the New Road to Corruption</EMPHASIS>. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is one thing to establish a system that guarantees contending factions an opportunity to express their views, and quite another to auction off the system to those factions that can afford to pay for most of the time to express them&mdash;not to mention the secondary effects that such an auction system has. Whether or not the person who has the most broadcast time always prevails, it is demonstrable that the power and the cost of political broadcasting distort the political process.</PARA>
<PARA>Elizabeth Drew observed the scene in Washington over a number of years as political correspondent for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Yorker</EMPHASIS>. She became extremely concerned that pressures brought about by the incessant need to raise funds were distorting the very nature and practice of government in the United States. She observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pressures of money have made it more unlikely than ever that politicians will take difficult positions, exercise leadership. They have distorted the legislative product and the legislative process itself. The role of the legislator has changed. And the methods by which money is now organized and distributed have taken the country far from the way that our system of representative government is supposed to work.</PARA>
<PARA>In a nutshell, those two quotes outline why this Government was forced to act. The Opposition constantly says that there is no need to act until our system is demonstrated to have been corrupted and distorted, after the US model. The minority report of Senators Olsen and Kemp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there was no evidence of any proven Federal corruption put before the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>By allowing this to stand, as apparently a kind of recommendation, they are implying that this is the end of the matter. In refutation of that self-serving claim, I would like to quote from evidence given to the Select Committee by Mr Henry Burmester, principal adviser of the Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that the Government is entitled to say that in the interests of public order it should take action in advance to preserve the integrity of a system. If it has evidence that action in a certain way may assist, then it seems to me that would be a reasonable and legitimate way in which to preserve the integrity of that process. In other words, it need not wait until corruption has been proved to take action.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the view of the Government when it formulated this legislation, and it is this view that has been endorsed by the Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal complaint of Senators Olsen and Kemp in their minority report appears to be that the report distorts the thrust of evidence by selective quoting. Frankly, unless all evidence to a committee features in a report, quotes obviously do have to be selected. It then becomes a personal perspective as to when `selected' becomes `selective'. I suspect that they are really complaining that the quotes used are not selective in the way they would have wanted; that is, they believe that the quotes should have been chosen from the evidence of some of the witnesses who have a material self-interest in the issues canvassed by the legislation and whose evidence thus suited Opposition senators, instead of from the evidence of a number of witnesses who gave substantive evidence and whose evidence has been used to finetune the legislation to cater for legitimate concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of free speech naturally entered into Committee deliberations, as it has entered into the debate on this legislation all along. The Opposition senators continue to claim that all that we hold sacred in this respect is under dire threat. Mr Andrew Short, of the Law Council of Australia, told us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would say that members of the community have the right to express and communicate ideas and messages through the medium of their choice in the manner they see fit.</PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, such evidence comes strangely from an organisation representing a profession which makes a considerable part of its income from representing those using the legal system in various ways to deny individuals and organisations the rights of unfettered free speech. I hasten to add that, like many others, I consider Australian defamation laws to be excessive. I readily concede that the right to unfettered speech has to be weighed against other interests&mdash;the right to privacy; the need to preserve social cohesion as in the case of racial vilification laws, and as is the case with this legislation, the right of the population to be protected against a distorted and corrupt political system&mdash;but I find it sad that members of the Opposition are prepared to debase the important debate about free speech and human rights for their own narrow and expedient political ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this tactic they have made much of the ambivalent attitude of the Commissioner for Human Rights and Equal Opportunity, Mr Brian Burdekin, on whether this legislation complies with articles 19(2) and 19(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a party. Article 19(2) requires parties to guarantee the right of freedom of expression. This right is not absolute, as article 19(3) makes clear. It provides that the right may be limited in the interests of political order, which of course refers us back to the quote from Mr Burmester of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition scorns the advice that the Government has received from its official legal advisers in the Attorney-General's Department that the legislation's aim of preventing political corruption falls within the meaning of article 19(3), which means that the legislation does not breach the covenant. All of a sudden the Opposition has preferred to listen to a man, Mr Burdekin, whose job it has vowed to scrap if ever it wins government. Mr Burdekin did appear before the Committee. I do not have time to go into the details of his evidence, but by and large it reflects his opinions, which have previously been widely canvassed in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to fully understand the expedient nature of the denigration of the advice offered to the Government by the Attorney-General's Department, one has only to go back a couple of years to an interview conducted on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law Report</EMPHASIS> with the then shadow Attorney-General, Neil Brown. I have mentioned this in an earlier debate in the Senate. In affirming that the Attorney-General's Department is the pre-eminent source of legal advice for the Government, Mr Brown said in reference to whether the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would be missed when it came to advice to government on Australia's obligations under international conventions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I'm quite satisfied that the lawyers of the Attorney-General's Department will exercise their function with true detachment and independence of mind. I think non-lawyers often think that it's impossible for lawyers to do that, but most lawyers realise that it can and is done on a daily basis by lawyers. So, I don't really have any concerns about that . . . I would be quite happy myself, to have the Department itself and lawyers in the Department, look at our international obligations and whether they are being complied with under these conventions.</PARA>
<PARA>The story has apparently changed over the short period of a couple of years. Looking on the bright side, the Opposition's new-found reliance on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may mean a reprieve for Mr Burdekin and the Commission. </PARA>

I raise this again only because I believe that certain of Senator Kemp's prejudices and obsessions which have been on display to us since the end of the sittings of the Senate last year, acted to materially distort and devalue his contribution to the Committee. I refer mainly to his religiously held belief that the trade union movement&mdash;including officials and members of trade unions&mdash;is basically responsible for all evils in Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out there where Senator Kemp is, on the loony Right, workers are resources, just like the raw materials used in production&mdash;just part of the equation&mdash;and the unions, in working to protect the wages and conditions of workers, distort the perfection of the market. Because of this belief, Senator Kemp sat through the hearings eagerly attempting to elicit anti-union statements from witnesses&mdash;I might say, without much success. His attempts to demonstrate that the disclosure of political donations to the conservative parties is dangerous because of so-called union intimidation practised against donors fell particularly flat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Ironically, the only time that Senator Kemp really hit pay-dirt in following this tack was with the final witness before the Committee, Mr Mark Sherry. This really is sad and pathetic. Senator Kemp and Mr Sherry are both great denigrators of trade unions, but they approach it from absolutely diametrically opposed viewpoints. Nevertheless, I think Senator Kemp appeared willing to risk the label of a born-again Trotskyite in his obsessive quest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned some of the details of Mr Sherry's evidence in my speech to the Senate last week, and I want to expand on that tonight because I personally took great exception to his evidence. His written submission to the Committee raised matters almost entirely outside the terms of reference of the Committee, and his evidence before the Committee on the final day of hearing reflected precisely that. I did not believe that he should have been called to give evidence before the Committee and I voted against him being called. I believe that my stance on that occasion&mdash;and within the Committee I was in a minority of one&mdash;was vindicated by his evidence, which was almost entirely a diatribe in which he slandered and belittled a whole range of individuals involved in the trade union movement under the protection of parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this matter because I believe it is essential that it be made clear that his evidence does not stand unchallenged. It was subsequently refuted in a late submission to the Committee from solicitors representing Mr Ardill of the Queensland branch of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, who was grievously slandered by Mr Sherry. In this response, Mr Ardill was able to demonstrate comprehensively that the claims Mr Sherry made against him were false. That needs to be put on the record in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the appearance and leading questioning of Mr Sherry was part of a consistent pattern by the Opposition members, or, more particularly, Senator Kemp. The Opposition members came to the Committee carrying a brief to thwart, delay and sidetrack the Committee. Why? It is quite simple. Issues of free speech, the political process and obviously Senator Kemp's union bashing, were not the main issues that this Committee had to deal with, but the Opposition would bring any red herring into the debate because of the absolute fear and loathing that it had for the disclosure provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has hidden behind its new trendy phrase of free, fair and equitable disclosure. It does not believe in the disclosure of political donations at all. I do not believe that in the vote on the second reading or in the committee stage the Opposition will be supporting any disclosure provisions at all. The Opposition has claimed total opposition to the banning of advertisements but total support for the disclosure of donations. The Government has always been fully committed to putting the two issues into the one piece of legislation because they genuinely are clearly linked. The Opposition knew of this strong belief, and I suppose that is why it dared to ask for the two issues to be separated. I bet Opposition members had a few sleepless nights, because I can imagine they would have been very worried that the Government would weaken and that they would have to put their money where their mouths were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer made it absolutely clear to the Committee that he supported so-called full, fair and equitable disclosure but he said, `We won't be able to accept anything the Government puts forward'. He suggested that if there was any form of disclosure, donors to political parties would be intimidated. When asked to put up an example of intimidation, not one witness before the Committee, from the major political parties particularly, could come forward with one. There was no example given by any of the major political parties of the intimidation of any donor in recent Australian political history. By `recent Australian political history', I mean in the last 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's case fell down absolutely on this point. There was never any suggestion made by any witness before the Committee that political advertisements in Australia were in any sense a worthy or constructive part of the political process in this nation. There was plenty of evidence, particularly from witnesses such as Mr Phillip Adams and Mr Rod Cameron, about the nature of political advertising and how it debases the political process in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was with some interest, but not a lot, that I listened to Senator Faulkner's speech on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. Part of my lack of interest was due to the clear indication from his body movements that he was not speaking from the heart. He was, if not reading his speech directly all the time, speaking from very copious notes. He only intermittently broke away from those notes to give us some indication of what he really thinks, or some indication as to whether he is capable of thought at all without some notes in front of him. Nonetheless, it has been an interesting exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I would like to raise is one which Senator Faulkner raised: the question of public order. Senator Faulkner said that, unless there is free and proper conduct of elections, public order is destroyed and, because public order may be at risk if elections are not conducted in a free and proper manner, we are justified in limiting the freedom of speech that all Australians now enjoy to protect that public order; in other words, if we think there is some sort of corruption going on in the democratic system, we are justified in limiting freedom of speech in order to correct that corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a total non sequitur; in other words, it is just a nonsense. If one really wants to maintain public order in its most general sense, one must have the free and proper conduct of elections. On that much at least I think both sides agree: there has to be free and proper conduct of elections. We differ in that I say that what is essential, more than anything else, to the free and proper conduct of elections is freedom of speech in those elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean speech that is not paid for, as some of the less intellectual members of the Labor Party have chosen to say; it means an unrestricted exchange of views. I want to know what people on the other side of the chamber have to say. They may want to know what people on this side of the chamber have to say. We all want to know what the Democrats will have to say and what Senator Harradine, who is not in the chamber tonight, as an independent, has to say. We want to know what Senator Vallentine has to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People casting a vote, especially young Australians casting a vote for the first time who have not yet perhaps built up a voting pattern or a voting habit, will want to know what each person they might be asked to vote for stands for. That does not seem to be an unreasonable expectation. They can find that out only if there is an unrestricted exchange of views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is seeking to say, `Well, you can have this exchange of views but only through the print media'. There is no sense in that&mdash;no sense at all. Why should one have an unrestricted exchange of views through the print media but not through radio and television?  I have no doubt you will understand, Madam Acting Deputy President, that this is especially the case when most Australians spend far more time listening to the radio and watching television than they do in reading newspapers. Certainly, single mothers at home with a couple of children have no time to sit down to read the paper to get an idea of different political views. But they can have the radio or television on while they are doing the ironing or any of the range of tasks they may perform, as workers can have the radio on on their way to work. People often have the radio on at work, and certainly some people listen to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drive Time</EMPHASIS> on the way home. But this legislation says that we will have an unrestricted exchange of political views but only in the print media. Of course, it is not an unrestricted exchange of views on that basis, is it?  It is not unrestricted at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party says that we have to have this restriction on freedom of speech because of corruption in the system. Members of the Labor Party might know a lot more than I do about how the system is corrupted. In fact, on the basis of some of the speeches that have been made, I suspect they do. But that is what we really want to know. How will this Bill get rid of corruption in the system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Suppose the Labor Party were to have a leadership change, as is expected, so that the honourable member for Blaxland, Mr Keating, became Prime Minister. Would anybody in this chamber&mdash;you, Madam Acting Deputy President, or Senator Faulkner, Senator McMullan or Senator Aulich on the other side of the chamber&mdash;honestly think that Mr Keating would say, `Oh, well, hell, we can't advertise on radio and TV. Never mind, we will just put in a few print ads. We won't spend anywhere near as much as we did, and everything will be okay.'? Oh, no, no-one imagines that. No-one in his or her right mind would imagine that. The most stupid person I have ever met would not imagine that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every penny that the Labor Party can lay its hands on will go into the most direct advertising campaign towards Australians that we have ever seen. There will be direct mail funded by the taxpayer, letterbox leaflets&mdash;you name it. The same amount of money can easily be spent. Certainly if one wanted to reach the same number of voters through the print media one would need to spend more than is spent through radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Government has not told us how it will ensure that all the money that now goes into electronic advertising will not go into some other form of trying to woo voters. I have never met anybody who imagines that parties in opposition will, all of a sudden, not feel determined to seize the reins of power. Nobody I have met would believe that governments would not do everything they could to keep the reins of power. At very best, all that will happen as a result of limiting the opportunity of Australians to place advertisements on radio and television, and therefore for other Australians to hear those views on radio and to see them presented through television, will be a reallocation of expenses from one area into another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity for corruption, the need for money, will still be there. I am amazed that Senator Faulkner, with his great intellectual skills, either cannot see or chooses to bypass that issue.

How does this Bill do that?  I will be very interested to hear what Senator Aulich has to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other points that Senator Faulkner chose to make concerned the business of free speech. He made some remarks about the Human Rights Commission. He used the typical common parlance of freedom of speech to try to create the impression, I suppose, that he agreed with Senator Aulich's remarks the other day that this Bill does not attack free speech but rather attacks bought speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Aulich interjects `That's right'. As I pointed out to him the other day, at an Estimates committee meeting I asked representatives of the Human Rights Commission whether they employed qualified and decent staff. They said, `Yes, we do'. Then, when I asked, `Would you employ someone who, in response to the question, "What is free speech?" said "Not bought speech"?', they were somewhat embarrassed and declined to answer. All the officers from the Attorney-General's Department behind them were in gales of laughter. Why? The reason the Human Rights Commission declined to answer is that that is what Senator Bolkus, the relevant Minister for this legislation, had been saying. They knew that it was so stupid they could not possibly give an honest answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one who has done elementary human rights law believes that `free speech' means `not bought speech'. Even someone who failed elementary human rights law would understand that. It means `unrestricted speech'. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sorry to labour that point but it seems that members of your Party have misunderstood that point and need to be reminded of it again and again. `Free speech' in human rights legislation does not mean `bought speech' at all; it means unrestricted speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner then went on to have a cheap shot at a member of the legal profession in my State, Mr Andrew Short. I do not know whether Senator Faulkner has any understanding of how the legal profession works or whether he has any understanding of the legal system at all. If he has, it has not been obvious to me in the time that I have shared a place in the Senate with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner said basically that it was unusual for Mr Short, a member of the legal profession, to come forward and argue in favour of free speech because, after all, the legal profession was engaged in trying to ensure that everyone else does not have free speech. In those remarks he referred to the fact that if I say something about you, Mr Acting Deputy President, which is libellous or slanderous, you may go to a member of the legal profession who would protect you against what I have said and who would give you access to your rights and assist you in putting me back in my box if I have done the wrong thing. That is what members of the legal profession do when they access the laws of defamation and slander. They are not trying to ensure that I do not get my free speech; they are trying to ensure that I have my free speech without unfairly impugning your integrity and unfairly limiting your opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So to suggest that a lawyer who might work in the area of defamation and slander is out to curb people's free speech is almost a laughable notion. I almost regret having wasted time on this point but, since this member of the profession is from my State and Senator Faulkner chose to make such a cheap point, I thought it was probably worth a couple of minutes. I would be interested to hear any Labor speaker get up and make a case for saying that the protection of their rights and my rights against being unfairly libelled or unfairly slandered is a bad thing. If they are prepared to do that, we might have a better debate. </PARA>

I have made this point before; it is a very simple one which I would have thought members of the Labor Party would have understood. It requires one party that wishes to buy influence, by fair means or foul&mdash;I do not suppose that there are any fair means of buying influence&mdash;and it requires another party that is prepared to sell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Removing the need for the parties to raise money for electronic advertising will not, firstly, remove the need for them to raise money to persuade in some other way members of the Australian electorate which way they ought to vote. That is the first thing that the legislation will not remove. Because it will not remove that, there may still be some people who, if they already have this view, feel that because they need to raise money they can exchange favours for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But more particularly, if those people who want to buy influence are there now, they will be there after the passage of this legislation. People do not care whether they sell their influence for advertising money, a free 12 months test drive of a BMW or some private school fees. People who want to buy influence will not be removed by the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that there are people who are prepared to sell influence, they are also not removed by the passage of this legislation. To the extent that there are still people in the community who want to buy influence and buy it improperly, and to the extent to which there are still people around who are prepared to sell it but should not, those two groups of people will find a way to meet. The passage of this legislation will touch none of them because, as I say, firstly, these two types of people have a natural affection for each other and, secondly, to the extent that advertising costs might play a part in this matter, the parties will simply reallocate those costs to other means of convincing Australians that they ought to vote for one major party or another or for the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point I want to make relates to cost. It is quite understandable that people should talk about millions of dollars, but most of us in this chamber are not millionaires. I say `most of us' because I know that there are quite a few millionaires in the Labor Party; there are far more than there are on my side of politics. They are not big noters about the amount of money that they have but we all know that they are there. There is a general understanding in the community that there are more millionaires in the Labor Party&mdash;the champagne socialists&mdash;than there are on this side of the chamber. We have had much discussion from these people about the outrageous cost of electronic advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this chamber the other day, Senator Schacht indicated that the cost of electronic advertising at the last election was $30m.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am familiar with the views expressed&mdash;in fact, I concur with the views&mdash;that quite a bit of political advertising we have seen from both the major parties, and certainly from the Australian Democrats, has not been what one would call substantive. One would be drawing a very long bow to say that some of this advertising had any real substantive comment in it at all. I can understand that some people ask, `Why do we bother? Why do we allow these people to do this if there is nothing substantive in it?', forgetting that people should be allowed to do what they like as long as they do not offend anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very good reason why non-substantive political advertising should still be allowed. I think I raised in this chamber the other day&mdash;Senator Aulich must be a slow learner if he has forgotten&mdash;the matter of the Labor Party advertising in the last election. It was very good. There were beautiful panoramic scenes of the environment. The voters were told, `Vote for us, we are the Party that cares about the environment'. We had Kakadu, Uluru&mdash;the lot. It was beautiful, panoramic, wonderful filming, wonderful production artwork, trying to convince Australians that they should vote for the Australian Labor Party because it was the pro-environment party. Of course, we now know what the environmental movement thinks of the Labor Party and how quickly that little deal that was stitched up was sold out on. We know that, and most Australians understand that now, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do I condemn members of the Labor Party for running that sort of advertisement? Yes, in the sense that they never really meant it, in my view. Yes, for saying something that they did not mean. But I do not condemn them for not being substantive, because that advertisement, and any other non-substantive advertisement, plays a very useful role in promoting debate on the issues. When people go into a pub they see such advertisements on Sky Channel. If they asked, `What do you think about that?', there would be a few guys standing around the bar talking about environmental issues. I think that is a good thing. Political advertising does not simply have the role of passing on substantive information; it has the role of promoting debate on particular issues. That is a role for this type of advertising that is often forgotten and overlooked, but it is very necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians admit that politically we are a very apathetic nation.

That is the role these little people were going to play. These are the people whom Senator Walsh says are the fairies at the bottom of the garden. What do we find them supporting now? We find them supporting something that will give them a big slice of taxpayers' dollars to advertise their own position&mdash;a slice of taxpayers' dollars that they could not get by asking the taxpayers for it. There is a little self-interest&mdash;quite a large self-interest&mdash;motivating the Australian Democrats in pushing this matter through this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already canvassed my views as to how the abolition of the use of electronic advertising will not remove any opportunity for corruption that now exists&mdash;not at all. I also make the point that I do not think the disclosure matters and the advertisement ban matters are related at all. If the Government is genuine about wanting to get rid of the possibility of corruption, it will support full, fair and equitable disclosure in any event. The Government will not make it contingent on getting an advertising ban. These two matters can stand alone, and they should stand alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second last point I want to make relates to intimidation. I am amazed that Senator Faulkner is without such wit as to be able to understand why someone who feels intimidated is not prepared to come forward and say, `Hey, I have been intimidated by these people. They have threatened me'. Does that amaze anyone? It does not amaze me. If someone came and threatened the daylights out of me, I would be a bit careful about fronting up and owning up to it. I would be too embarrassed; I would be frightened for my future. The mere lack of evidence on this matter does not mean much at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My last point in relation to this matter is this:  this morning I heard some speakers on the other side of the chamber&mdash;and I think Senator McMullan was one of them&mdash;saying that the matter was not being shoved through, that there has been plenty of time, because the idea has been around for four or five years and we have had various committees looking at it. But they completely overlooked the fact that a significant number of amendments to the Bill have been put in at the last minute. Just before the suspension of the sitting, I heard that the Government is still working on amendments. We still do not know the proper detail of the package we are being asked to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is the Government's view that, in general, an idea that has been hanging around like a bit of fairy floss for a few years should be supported, then I look forward to when the people on this side of the chamber move over there and get into government. If we have legislation to introduce on proper enterprise bargaining&mdash;so that one does not have to go to the industrial commission and say, `Please, sir, may I have this; three bags full, sir'&mdash;I assume that the Labor Party will not expect to have time to look at the details. I assume it will be happy with the argument, `The idea has been around for a few years; you've had plenty of time to think about it; you won't need the time for the detail'. That example shows how ludicrous that proposition put forward is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea has been around for a while. But I am not paid to vote on an idea in general; I am paid to vote on specific details.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is an interesting one. I understand that Senator Vanstone may have wanted to be on the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures which looked at this issue but that Senator Kemp went on it instead. It was interesting to see his contribution from time to time during the hearings, although I will not go into those details. However, one thing that has come out quite clearly in the discussion post the Committee is that a number of vested interest groups have written to this Parliament to give their views about the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated the other day in a previous debate on this issue, those vested interest groups have from time to time been used by the Liberal Party of Australia in various ways. For example, the Liberal Party has sent them draft letters suggesting that those letters could be forwarded to members of parliament. Unfortunately, the vested interest groups have not bothered to change the nature of the letter very much, so  basically what has been received by us in this Parliament is a copy of the letter sent out by the Liberal Party. The letters have come back to us saying, `Isn't it terrible that what the Labor Party wants to do is in fact stop free speech'. The interest groups then parrot back to us what the Liberal Party has told them they ought to say. In some cases, those people have been innocent dupes of the Liberal Party: they have been welfare groups who do not think too much about it and who believe what the Liberals told them in their letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received one such letter today, written to a prominent Democrat senator. This letter, dated 3 December, is a perfect example of the ways and means being used by the Liberals and the National Party of Australia to try to undermine this Bill. First, the Opposition has said that the Bill is a ban on free speech and then it has written letters and sent them out to various organisations. Honourable senators will recall that Senator Parer said the other day, `Would the Liberal Party write speeches for people?  Would the Liberal Party draft letters for them, send them copies of those letters and then ask them to send them back to members of parliament?  No, the Liberal Party would not do that'. Yet here in front of me is a fax of a letter signed by nine people from one particular company based in Hobart, Tasmania. This fax was sent to one of the Australian Democrats and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator X&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we will protect the identity of the particular senator&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that tomorrow the Federal Government is planning to introduce legislation into the Senate to outlaw the placing of any advertisement which could be construed as in any way political on the electronic media.</PARA>
<PARA>That is normal language that people in these companies use. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I further understand that you will be voting in support of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>This is pretty quick, considering the letter is dated 3 December. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask you to reconsider your position and vote against the legislation. It is an infringement of the right of any Australian to express views on any issue without hindrance.</PARA>
<PARA>Then in upper case, just in case the Democrats do not get the point, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stick by the Democrats' stated position of open government&mdash;don't allow yourself to be bought by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter is signed by these people `All of APPM, Hobart, Tasmania'. It is nice to hear that some people in Tasmania have views about freedom of expression. But this letter, as with other letters we have seen, give a lie to what the Liberals told us the other day during the debate on the Committee's report. The Liberals said to us that they do not write letters for vested interest groups; they do not write letters for various individuals; and they do not write letters to people to inundate this Parliament with faxes. They allow free speech to be just that:  the speech of individuals or concerned groups based upon their view of the facts and then to put their view to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could anyone in this place&mdash;including Senator Parer, who tonight indulged in the typical sort of personal attack that has now become par for the course in this Parliament on the part of the Liberals&mdash;say that that is an example of free speech?  It would seem to me that that is an example of organised speech where someone in the Liberal Party writes the letter and the individual or interest group sends it to this Parliament, to the Democrats, in an attempt to convince the Democrats that that is an expression of his own views. It is a typical example of the organisation which some political parties use under the guise of free speech to make their so-called views known to Parliament. So much for Senator Parer and his view that the Liberals in fact have never organised vested interest groups or individuals out in the community to write to this Parliament in order to put pressure on the Democrats. </PARA>

I have no time at all for political parties which use individuals in the community as dupes in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move to my next point. The basic question in this whole Bill is how to stop the escalating costs of political campaigns at election time. It is a major issue and I think every party agrees on that point. Some parties have less concern about it than others, but certainly the Labor Party&mdash;and I am sure now the Democrats&mdash;have indicated quite clearly that the day when we can continue to spend up to $16m each election on electronic advertising alone for election campaigns has gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next day or so, this Parliament will make the decision to put all of that aside. It will say that the pursuit of that sort of money, to pay for that sort of very expensive campaign, is no longer tenable and acceptable in a democratic system. At the last election all political parties spent more than $30m campaigning, $16m of which went on electronic advertising. That is the problem. How do we stop that sort of expenditure in election campaigns? The major reason why we need to look at this is that there is a potential for corruption in a system in which $16m is going to be spent on one form of campaigning&mdash;$34m all-up between the major political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the political parties are in search of that sort of money to be available to compete with each other, someone has to give them that money. Nobody gives political parties money except, basically, for two reasons: one is that they are absolutely idealistic, they believe in the cause of that political party and they will contribute to the best of their capacity to it. I have been given money at different times in my political career by some very poor people&mdash;literally $2, $5 and so on. Once, when I lost my seat, someone who I had never met gave me money out of the blue to say, `Hope you will get through the next few weeks'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As every member of this Parliament knows, when election day comes, that is the end of our salaries. If we do not have a job after that, it is tough luck. Someone I had never met before in my life helped me out during that time. In one way or another that person must have been impressed with what I did&mdash;as was indicated in a letter sent to me. Pensioners give money to individual politicians or parties because they are idealistically impressed by those parties. That is one side of the coin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin are the people who have enough money to pay political parties to achieve a benefit for themselves as individuals or the groups they represent. Those people say, `I will buy the best political party I can buy'. We have seen that operating in Australia in the last few years on a fairly systematic basis. It certainly operated in the United States on a very systematic basis for a very long time. It operates in Japan. One Japanese prime minister told me, in a private interview&mdash;it is no longer private because he has since published that information&mdash;that it cost him $US28m to become prime minister and that he was unlikely ever to be prime minister again because he was never likely again to be able to raise $US28m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the Japanese system, brought about partly by their electoral process whereby there are three people in each electorate and there is a tendency for people to try to work within the dominant political party to get the numbers to become the leader of that party. That costs money. The election campaign is a question of funding the right members of the winning party in order to get oneself elected as leader. Endemic corruption is built into the Japanese system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Endemic corruption is also built into the American system, where every senator literally has to raise $10,000 per week in order to run a moderate campaign. That is a large amount of their resources, ideas and intellectual energy that should be preserved for other activities going into fundraising. In a sense, they make themselves available for vested interest groups to pay them. What do those vested interest groups want? They want benefits for themselves. If it is not the oil lobby in the United States which is asking for a minimum taxation or, in many cases, tax write-offs, by putting money in the coffers of various senators and members of the House of Representatives, it will be other interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways, Australia was going down the same road. We are lucky because this Government has made the tough decision. It has said, `We are going to ban paid political advertising during election campaigns'. This Labor Government had the courage to say, `We do not care whether the major television networks in this country hate us because of it, or whether the major television networks of this country lose income because of it. We do not care whether many of the newspapers, misunderstanding this Bill, have said, "We oppose it and we think the Labor Party should be thrown out of office because it has brought in this Bill"'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that a government has to take a stand at this time. We have to make a decision now as to whether we are going to have the best Parliament that money can buy&mdash;like the American system or, for that matter, the Japanese system&mdash;or whether we are going to have something that is peculiarly Australian which is, on the whole, honest&mdash;particularly at the Federal level&mdash;and where the Parliament owes very little to outside interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I want to be able to get up in this place and say that the tobacco industry stinks, it gives people cancer, it deliberately encourages young people to smoke and, ultimately, many of those young people kill themselves. I do not want to get up in this place, as I did one year, and ask a question about tobacco bans and have one of my colleagues say, `Hey! We get money from them and so do the Liberals'. I know that tobacco smoking is a death dealing exercise. It is being pushed on young people in this country by people who are prepared to spend a lot of money, and once they used to give to all political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to see those sorts of interest groups thrown out of the political scene. I want to be able to vote freely on that sort of thing. If my vote and my views about tobacco advertising are going to be canvassed, I want to make those views plain in this place. I want to vote in a particular way, without concerning myself about which vested interest group is giving money to my Party, the Liberals or any other party in this Parliament, in order to protect itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the danger of having election campaigns which cost $34m or more, where $16m is spent on electronic advertising. At the end of the day, you have to get the money to pay for it. That means you have to go to vested interest groups, or they come to you. They say, `Here is the money, but the price of our support is this, this or this'. I do not want to pay that price as a member of a political party. No-one in this Parliament should have to pay that price&mdash;to have their judgment and their views about particular issues affected by the people who pay the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party seems quite happy to go on with that system because, traditionally, it has always raised more money than the Labor Party. In recent years that has not been the case. In fact, the Liberals are better at rearranging their finances between their Federal office and their State branches. That is the major reason why we appear to be spending as much as, or slightly more than, the Liberal and National parties. That is not the case. The fact is that our accounting system is much more honest and open. We say, `That is what we spent on the Federal election'. On the other hand, the Liberal Party says, `That is what we spent on the Federal election, but we had some administrative costs which came out at the same time as the Federal election which happened to be ascribed to the State branches'. Of course, under the current disclosure arrangements, State branches do not have to tell us what money went through their coffers at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, all political parties will be prisoners of vested interest groups if, in order to run expensive election campaigns, they have to keep chasing money. The potential for corruption is there. When I was a member of parliament in Tasmania, I was the Minister administering the Electoral Act. Down there we had a system that limited expenditure to $1,500 per individual when running for parliament. The situation arose where I had to prosecute members of my own Cabinet, put people into court, because they had overspent and then said they had done otherwise. </PARA>

I have no problems with that, provided it is public, so that everyone knew that the two or three political parties received money from such and such a source.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to move money around between election fundraising and administrative costs so that, for example, it is moved out of what is in effect electoral fundraising into the area of administrative costs&mdash;to pretend that the money was never given for election purposes&mdash;is wrong.

It has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Liberals may think at this time that, coming up to this election, they are going to get more money from business But, as with all political parties, the people who are most likely to give money are the people who believe they are going to get something out of it for themselves.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes $15,000, $100,000 or so in a Federal campaign from a particular company may be a handicap for the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this Bill covers both areas. First of all, it cuts back on the whole question of the enormous competition that exists at the moment between various parties in the electronic media&mdash;a terribly expensive way of campaigning. If we cut that out, we cut out the search for major amounts of campaign funding. And if we cut out the search for major amounts of campaign funding, we cut out the capacity of dishonest people to corrupt political parties. That is the first issue. On the whole, Australia has been relatively free of this type of corruption, except at State level. I think it is time we got our house in order and I think this Bill is the way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the Bill concerns the question of disclosure. It basically says that, if people give money to political parties in any way&mdash;whether they give it to their administrative fund, their election fund or whatever fund they care to call it&mdash;that must be made public. At any time it is subject to a spot-audit by the Electoral Commission. I do not think there is anyone in this House who would disagree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that the Liberal Party has got itself hooked on one ideological problem. I do not cast aspersions on it; I do not say that it is necessarily crooked; I do not say that it is more likely to be influenced by business money; I do not say that it is a party made up of the sort of people who are the creatures of big business. But the Liberal Party has a view about so-called freedom of choice. It says that campaign expenditure, big expensive TV campaigns, are related to the freedom of choice enjoyed by the voter, someone who can choose to vote one way or the other based on the information that is coming to them via paid advertisements. Surely honourable senators opposite cannot believe individually that paid advertisements are the only way to learn the truth about what a political party wants to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be other ways; there are other ways. The Bill says that there are other ways.

Out of the 19 countries surveyed, 14 do the same sort of thing as that which we are proposing in this Bill. Those countries ask why people should buy votes during campaigns. Why should political parties be able to buy votes because they can afford to buy paid advertising? There are controls over the situation in those countries. There may be no political advertising at all, or parties are given free time, or some other arrangement is in place. They do not say it should be open slather&mdash;`You can buy whatever time you like'. </PARA>

I do not believe that because someone has money that person should have more influence in this community than anyone else. I do not believe that because someone can raise $50,000 they should have the right to have three one-minute advertisements on television, and that $50,000 is excluding the cost of making them. I believe that free speech is what people say in this place, what people say in the street, and what people say on television when they genuinely get free time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991, although after hearing Senator Aulich one would wonder whether that is the case. This legislation is notionally to impose a ban on the broadcast of political advertisements, to strengthen the rules relating to donations received by political parties, and to increase the public funding for each Senate vote. That is how the Australian Labor Party would have us describe the Bill and that is how&mdash;albeit rather pathetically, without much gusto&mdash;it has tried to sell it to the Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we all know the real story behind this legislation. It is quite interesting to see Senator Aulich leaving the chamber now when he was so critical of Senator Walters earlier for walking out of the chamber and then coming back in. I imagine that Senator Aulich will not return; he will now go back to his office and go to sleep again. The simple fact is that the Labor Party is on the nose around Australia. Even in States in which the Labor Party holds government, it is a fairly tenuous hold. In Tasmania, which Senator Aulich purports to represent, in Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia, the prospect of going to the polls is rather frightening for the Labor Party because it knows it will be resoundingly and deservedly thrashed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moneymakers of the Labor Party have either lost enthusiasm for their jobs or they are under scrutiny by various royal commissions and the like. There are no Brian Burkes raking in the lolly over cosy lunches any more. Those days are definitely over for the Labor Party. The local bagmen do not have the charisma to entice too many people to the dinner table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hard fact is that the various State offices of the ALP are still trying to pay off the excesses of the last Federal election. Some say that in New South Wales it is $7m in debt. Of course, we know what sort of week Senator Loosley has had. As former New South Wales State Secretary, and now the Federal President of the ALP, he has managed with a little help from his executive to put New South Wales into a fairly tight financial position. Some people, talking in financial terms, would call it insolvency, and many have referred to it as insolvency for the Labor Party in New South Wales. The sum of $3.8m is a fairly large miscalculation in balancing the books, even by ALP reckoning. Senator Loosley appears to have done it with such flair and ease that clearly he realises that he has the financial skills to be Treasurer of this country under the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of that degree of financial management and in light of the Burke allegations, is it any wonder that the rank and file of the ALP no longer have any stomach for the lamington and pie drives or the chook raffles of the past? They are not giving money&mdash;and why should they, particularly in a recession, when in years past millions could be promised over one lunch and others lost so easily by the Federal President of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, we are here today. The Government cannot make up its mind about this Bill. One might suggest that the Bill has had a chequered career. One might also suggest that the Government is so confused and divided on this issue that its on again, off again attitude is merely reflective of who is running the show at whatever time it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time we were due to debate this legislation, which was in August, we were called back to Canberra a week ahead of schedule because the Federal Government was convinced that it had to have its political broadcasting ban Bill put through parliament. As we all know, the Government changed its mind and agreed to let the Bill go to the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures. Even the Government senators on that committee clearly could not get it right, because we now have 37 amendments, and I think there were some more tonight&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;More are coming tonight. We have all lost track of how many amendments there are to the Government's own Bill. Mr Deputy President, help us; help all the Australian people. We have that many amendments to your own Bill before the Bill is even debated. It is bad drafting, bad organisation, or just a bad Bill. I think that when the Australian people see the Bill&mdash;and I am quite sure that Senator Kemp and Senator Durack would agree&mdash;they will think that it is a despicable Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that many amendments needed to the Bill, it has obviously proved itself on the course here before we even get going with the debate. If the Public Service boffins get it wrong, I suppose we can just call it a typographical error, as Mr Howe did last night. If anything is wrong with the Bill, I suppose those opposite will blame somebody else rather than blame their own Party for drafting the Bill in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four months ago, any talk of sending this legislation to a committee or curtailing the ban to an election period only was cynically dismissed by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus). We were told that we could not do it because the Bill was all about preventing corruption at the Federal political level, remember. Since then, we have had all sorts of changes, and helping them all along in this charade of democracy are the brokers of this Parliament&mdash;the keepers of parliamentary morality&mdash;the Democrats. So devoid of credibility are the Democrats after their appalling efforts last week with AIDEX that this morning one of my staff had to demonstrate that she was not a Democrat staffer because the taxi driver would not drive her if she were a Democrat staffer. That is what the community thinks about the Democrats. It matters little who is their leader; they are a spent force, as dead as a dead duck in the water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, deals have been done between the Democrats and the Labor Party and that is what this Bill is all about. When one starts to consider the implications of this legislation, one has to ask oneself why would any party&mdash;especially, as I have said, the champion of the worker&mdash;wish to deny information to the public. According to the ALP members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, they were concerned that there was a possibility of corruption entering Federal politics due to the high cost of political campaigns. They argued that, with the increasing use of television and the prospect of $10m or more being spent on electronic advertising, political parties would need to depend increasingly on donations from the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this really an admission of the Labor Party's own corruption, as we have not held the purse strings in the Federal Parliament for the last eight years? Is it an admission that the big mates of the Labor Party have now called in all of their favours and are not needed any more?  What is the story?  Why does the Labor Party want to introduce this legislation?  I guess the ALP would know because it knows all about doing favours for the corporate sector. It would also know that those corporate figures who supported the ALP so generously in years past are unlikely to do so in the future. Those who are not in a bankrupt state or in gaol have woken up to the fact that the ALP will not win another term, so why waste their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Labor Party so concerned as to the integrity of its own Party members and elected representatives that it has to put in place legislation to remove any temptation to sin?  Strangely, no other explanation has been given for introducing this legislation. In fact, little explanation has been given by any of the Labor MPs and senators to sell this particular notion. I have to ask myself, therefore, just how many on the Government benches actually believe in this Bill?  I wonder just how many actually believe that to deny one's right to be informed and to discriminate against radio and television is appropriate in this era. The speakers list says it all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation remains an attack on free speech and the basic freedoms associated with democracy. That is not just my view; it is the view of the Human Rights Commission and the view of many professors of law at several universities around Australia. The Government is again wasting taxpayers' money. All it is doing is shuffling the chairs on the deck of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>. This Bill will ultimately fail, if not in legislation, then certainly in practice, and with it will go the Government and the Democrats. They are looking for issues to give them a reason to exist, but they picked the wrong one in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be under no illusion: this Bill is totally and utterly a Labor Party attempt to ban free speech in this country. It really astounds me that people on the other side of this chamber want to do that, but I can understand the reasons for it, to which I have just alluded. I find it ironic that this champion of the workers' cause finds so much enthusiasm for the denial for such basic freedoms which are enjoyed by every civilised country around the globe. I will quote from today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, in which Michael Millett said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one thinks about it, one realises that the Government has done a pretty poor job of selling this legislation. If one talks to the people in the community one finds that they know very little about it. That is what this is all about: keep the people out there in the dark; do not let them know what is going on. That is what this Government is about. That is what it has done with the economy for the last few years when it said that it was actually doing everything right, and things were turning around and would be right very soon. That is what the Government has been on about all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP probably thought that, if it floated the Bill with the sales pitch that no longer would anyone have to watch boring television commercials about politics, people would be so grateful that they would think the legislation was a grand idea. The Government failed to realise that people in the real world are informed and want to be informed. They do watch more than just <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Neighbours</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">E Street</EMPHASIS>, and during an election campaign they like to see what political parties stand for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is as much an insult to the intelligence of the electorate as it is to their democratic rights. It is cynical, and the transparent dishonesty contained in this attempt to gag free speech will be seen for what it is. If the Labor Party is so seriously concerned about the potential for corruption in Federal politics, why has it taken it eight years to introduce legislation that will supposedly prevent it?  Why is it only now when, coincidentally, the Labor Party faces massive problems financially&mdash;not to mention politically&mdash;and when its flamboyant fundraisers have shot through, that it decides that this legislation is just what Australians need to keep them politically pure and incorruptible?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we all know it is no coincidence at all. At the last election the Labor Party saw the impact of advertising on television and radio. It saw that groups such as the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the National Association of Forest Industries could use electronic advertising very successfully to put the Labor Party on notice. Of course, those groups will not have any chance of advertising in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has rarely been able to run a decent television campaign, but it has spent mega-millions trying to do so. Now that it can no longer afford to play the game, those opposite want to change the rules and take their marbles home like spoilt little kids. The Labor Party is unable to present policies to the voters of this country for scrutiny because it has none; it is bereft of ideas. When we have a situation where the Labor Party is bankrupt, politically and financially, those are, and must be, the overriding reasons as to why in the face of such opposition this legislation is still being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the Opposition senators who served on the Select Committee submitted a dissenting report which left the Australian electorate in no confusion as to how the Opposition feels about the legislation. In their dissenting report, Senator John Olsen and Senator Rod Kemp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We remain implacably opposed to ANY `ban' on electronic political advertising. This position is vindicated by the quality and the strength of evidence against such a ban provided to the Select Committee by all but 7 of its 127 submissions and 4 witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask you: what were the Labor Party members of the Select Committee doing? Did they have their ears closed and their mouths open, which is the traditional Labor Party attitude? Did they have their ears closed to any decent evidence that came before them, or did they just not want to hear it? Had they taken a fixed position before the inquiry even started? I would suggest that their minds were ideologically set before the inquiry even began.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In no way is it just the Opposition that is opposed to the Bill. Many others realise its consequences and are as concerned about them as those of us in the Opposition are. Their concerns are not of a political nature; they are concerned with a denial of basic human rights. Professor Philip Alston, the Director of the Centre for International and Public Law and adviser on human rights issues to the United Nations, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we've got before us is a Bill . . . which . . . in my view can only be evaluated as being clearly, and I underline the word clearly, because lawyers don't normally use it, clearly inconsistent with human rights provisions and provisions which are binding upon Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us think about that. Professor Alston is someone who knows a little bit about international law. Of course he is not the only lawyer to dispute the legislation. The Law Council of Australia has condemned it as an infringement of free speech and a contravention of international law.

The Government is denying country people the chance to know what their candidates and political parties stand for. Many parts of that area of New South Wales, in the electorates of Richmond and Page, are quite isolated. There may not be a five-day-a-week mail service; mail is often delivered on only two or three days a week. Bread, milk and newspapers come with the mail.

As Senator Kernot is in this chamber, I will give her this information: I have had the opportunity this afternoon, as a result of my exchange with Senator Coulter, to seek information from the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, often called FACTS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FACTS estimates that the cost of free time is in the order of $18m. It has estimated that five-sixths will be in prime time and one-sixth will be in fringe time. I do not know whether Senator Kernot has figures on the cost of free time. In fact, the Government has not specified where this free time will occur. It is a natural assumption that there will be six minutes free time per station with five of those minutes most likely to be in prime time and the other minute in fringe time. If that is not correct and if Senator Kernot has other figures, it would be appreciated if she could lay them before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is saying that free time is needed for the major political parties to put their wares before the public under strictly controlled conditions. According to FACTS, the cost of that free time is $18m. That figure in fact is higher than the one that I gave Senator Coulter this morning. I thought it was of the order of $10m. But, having spoken to Mr Branigan in the course of the afternoon, I have learned it is $18m. I will be interested to see what Senator Kernot's figure is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure of $18m is very interesting. I wonder whether Senator Collins knows that $15m was spent on electronic advertising in the last election. So, under the so-called free time arrangements in this legislation, television stations will be asked to contribute advertising time worth in the order of $18m. I would be very interested, as I said, to know what Senator Kernot's assumptions are. Unfortunately, Senator Kernot has now left the chamber, so it is a bit fruitless to put figures forward but I hope some people will be listening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Bill the Australian Democrats will receive of the order of 10 per cent of the free time. So 10 per cent of free time will be awarded to the Australian Democrats. If we were to put a monetary value on this, the Australian Democrats would receive one-tenth of the $18m-worth of free time. That works out at $1.8m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at what the Australian Democrats spent on television and radio advertising in the March 1990 election. Although the figures are not directly comparable they do, nonetheless, provide a fair guide. We find that the Australian Democrats spent of the order of $300,000 on electronic advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the figures supplied to me by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, this Bill will enable the Australian Democrats to obtain $1.8m-worth of free time.

Where will we be then? We will be with a Bill that bans political advertising because political advertising will not be permitted under the free time arrangements.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many in the community rightly think that most political advertisements on radio and television are banal, trivial and misleading and we would be better off without them. The advertisements are also artful, clever manipulations that play on the emotions of unsophisticated voters. They are crafted with the aid of psychologists and market researchers to enable political parties to respond to gut feelings in the electorate and curry favour with those who hold those gut feelings. Any thought of politicians leading, inspiring or persuading the electorate is not countenanced in the mediums of the 30-second grab.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TV (and to a much lesser extent radio) political ads debase and degrade the entire tone of political dialogue throughout the western world.</PARA>
<PARA>That is similar to the way in which Senator Brownhill entered the debate this evening with his reference to dogs. Mr Robertson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their content almost never enlightens or informs. They are created by the same people who dream up campaigns for soap and cigarettes. They aim to manipulate the emotions, insidiously working to suspend reason and rationality. Often they pander to the basest and most selfish instincts of the electorate. They twist facts, selectively highlight half-truths, sometimes lie outrageously.</PARA>

But their real job is to hit and run.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rod Cameron, with a background of 20 years involvement in 54 State and Federal elections, gave the Committee an analysis of the tricks television advertising uses to engage and move its audience, noting that the audience to which such advertising was directed was the lowest common denominator in the community, the 40 per cent of the population that he said, if given a choice, would not vote. He described five types of advertisements that work. They did not include any based on substantive facts or information. They depended largely on emotional manipulation and scare tactics. These five were:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Corcoran argues that televised political communication actually forecloses&mdash;not opens up&mdash;rational public debate. Its purpose is precisely the opposite of classical rhetoric: its purpose is not to persuade, but to control; not to stimulate thought, but to prevent it; and not to convey information, but to conceal or distort it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Television advertising, the sort of political advertising that we see which is able to engage and move its audience with pictures and symbols, does not encourage voters to make reasoned and rational assessments of politics and policy. If democracy is understood to involve collective decision-making that reflects a concern with the interests each individual has to protect, I think it can be argued that televised political advertising actually interferes with the individual's ability to assess and defend his or her own interests, and it interferes with democracy itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all vulnerable to being manipulated through the use of the subtle tricks of the advertising trade. Television advertising is especially an area which utilises visual and, therefore, non-rational appeals. The use of televised political advertising is similarly oriented to causing people to make political choices on grounds other than reason. Voters are asked to feel good or bad about parties and to identify with political leaders, and they are not lectured on the merits of the policies they advocate. To allow televised political advertising is to encourage the view that this is acceptable within a democracy and I would argue that that sort of political advertising is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very basis of the rights of free speech and of free press is that these enhance discussion and reflection within the community and lead to more informed decision-making. It is my strong contention that televised political advertising of the type we are accustomed to in this country leads to less informed decision-making, and this is against the principles of democracy. That is why the Democrats have argued from the beginning for the concept of talking heads. At least with talking heads we will have an opportunity to listen to the merits of an argument and to hear politicians canvass policy. Why should voters not have the opportunity of listening to someone they may have to vote for? There is absolutely nothing radical in this proposal. It is done in overseas countries. </PARA>

In France, the following rules have been established for the televising of election campaigns: each candidate on the opening and closing dates of the first round of the elections would be entitled to five minutes, not two minutes. Between these two dates each candidate would be entitled to four slots of 15 minutes. This is free time we are talking about, and talking heads in French election campaigns. There is nothing radical in what we are hearing. These election broadcast slots could be made up with as much as 40 per cent film footage but they could not use the flag nor any combination of its colours; they could not use the national anthem on the soundtrack; and they could not use archival footage without the consent of those involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second point Senator Kemp raised was the possibility that this Bill would be challenged in the courts in the near future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point Senator Kemp raised was the fact that commercial radio is not included.

At this stage, it is quite happy to be exempted from the free time proposals that will apply to commercial television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp also asked: why the rush? I do not agree with the proposition that we do not have enough time to debate this Bill. We are devoting more time to this Bill than we have devoted to some major taxation Bills, some major social security Bills and the major telecommunication Bills, which we debated for eight hours in total, changing the entire structure of telecommunications in this country. That did not matter because the Opposition agreed with the Government's view on that. We have plenty of time to debate this proposition by 7.30 p.m. tomorrow. We will have plenty of time for the committee stage. We will then be able to get onto other important legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the position of the Australian Democrats on this issue. Since we had the first Bill presented, which was referred to a select committee, the Australian Democrats have had the opportunity to survey their membership. The results of that survey do not change the status of our 1988 policy. Nevertheless, the survey was very helpful in alerting our senators to the views held by our members. In the survey, 92 per cent of our members who responded said that they did not support the status quo; 73 per cent said that they supported an option for campaign only bans, replaced by regulated free time, including talking heads, truth in advertising and the whole thing being monitored by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are proposing in this Bill is supported by at least 50 per cent of the community; there is not a massive community campaign against this issue. If Dr Hewson gets 50 per cent of the vote, he is elected&mdash;nobody will quibble with that. Fifty per cent of the community agrees, some are undecided, the rest are opposed, based upon what they knew of the last Bill. There is not massive community feeling against this proposal. Indeed, half of them are glad that some change is being effected to the way political campaigns are conducted in this country.

Political parties and political candidates will have to stand up in front of people who are asked to elect them and say, `Judge me on what I am saying because I actually have something to say. I am not relying on glitzy, subliminal, manipulative images and messages'. The Australian Democrats are not afraid to stand up as talking heads and deliver substance on policy.

The Bill strikes at the heart of our democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment Senator Kernot on what was, for an Australian Democrat, a very thoughtful and sincere speech. I listened to it with great interest and even pleasure at some points. The speech had a couple of blemishes. One of them was the quite scurrilous attack, under parliamentary privilege, on a great Australian, Professor Ashley Goldsworthy, a person of the utmost integrity and accuracy, as we would expect from a leading mathematician. I will not let that attack pass without comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that concerned me a little was the evasiveness on the very clear and repeated questioning from the very articulate Senator Kemp. I would like to repeat Senator Kemp's questions in case other Democrats have the courage to enter the debate. I would ask them: surely, when Senator Kernot says that the value of the advertising in Sydney alone is $5m, this more than proves the point that Senator Kemp was making?  That would work out at an equivalent of $18m Australia-wide. Santa Claus has come early if one can get $18m for doing nothing other than running along with the rabble over the road here and voting for a Bill they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot is handling this Bill for the Democrats, and we want to know from her how much time the Democrats took in paid television advertising in the March 1990 election. We would also like to know how much television advertising will now be available to the Democrats free of charge in the 1993 election. If Senator Kernot could answer those two questions, we would be in a much better position to judge both the Democrats' credentials and their honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to matters of relevance to this debate. I am pleased to see that that great custodian of morality, Senator Aulich, is now in the chamber because I have a few things to say about him later on tonight. The Government puts the case that it is attacking corruption, but it is not prepared through any one of its speakers to give a demonstration of corruption in the electoral process in relation to fundraising. This Bill is just a cynical use&mdash;or misuse, to be more precise&mdash;of power by the Government of the day. It is not about funding; it is not about corruption; it is about human rights and the human rights of Australians to have a free say as to whom they want elected in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Free, not in terms of financial restraints but in terms of being able to get up and put a point of view before the public. We take freedom of speech for granted in Australia. It has been with us ever since Federation. I think the reason why we have freedom of speech in Australia is principally that this country has been ruled by governments of a Liberal persuasion for the great majority of the time since Federation. One of the dearest things that a Liberal government and governments of that persuasion have is a basic respect for an individual and an individual's rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to a free election will be put at risk by what the Government is proposing to do. When Senator Kernot was speaking, one of the interjections made on this side of the chamber was to the effect that this Bill is a major step down the path to a one-party State&mdash;and nothing would be dearer to the Labor Party's heart. The right of access to political power is being denied because the vehicle&mdash;public advertising, putting a point of view to the public&mdash;is going to be denied to the parties competing in an election under this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will affect the capacity of ordinary Australian citizens to work for social change through the avenues that are available to them in a civilised society; they will not be able to use the media to get a point of view across. In the State of Queensland, which I represent, that is going to be of particular relevance as we have a very large rural community. The rural community relies very heavily now on the electronic media. In country towns and on properties, most people now have television, an indifferent mail service and an indifferent distribution of newspapers; radio is often unreliable and television provides the medium. By denying the right of political parties to put their points of view on television, we are very much circumscribing the right of rural Australians to be informed of what are the issues of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly revert to a point that was made I think by Senator Macdonald by medium of interjection. There is a very strong case to be made that this Bill is quite unconstitutional, that it will not stand up to a challenge in the High Court and, if we do go ahead and pass it, that it will certainly be challenged at least by one of the State governments. The Government is attempting with this Bill not only to take away the rights of Australian citizens in voting for a Federal election but also to ride roughshod over the sovereign States and say, `You will conduct elections in accordance with these practices', and that simply cannot be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the arguments that have been put up by the Labor Party. There has been an awful lot of pious breast-beating, particularly by people like Senator Aulich, about the high costs of campaigns, as if there were something terrible about having an expensive election campaign. I think that is about as relevant a concern as my being concerned about the mates of the Labor Party buying a brand new Rolls Royce. It is simply none of my business what sort of car they buy. If they buy one, I presume they can afford it, and I would think the running up of big bills by any party in an election campaign is that party's concern and not mine if I am not of that party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This concern about high costs leads inevitably in the eyes of the Labor Party to the belief that principles must be sold out&mdash;and that is not a necessary corollary at all. Looking at the history of my own party, the Liberal Party, we have a practice that no member of parliament ever raises funds. I never know what funds are raised in a campaign I am in and I have never in my life collected money for a campaign I have been involved in. We separate the organisational side, which looks after fundraising, from the political side, or the parliamentary wing&mdash;those people who stand for election. I do not know what the practices are in the Democrats or the Labor Party, but I would suggest that that is not a difficult principle for those parties to follow if they are not already following it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to contemporary American practice. There has been some reference to that in other speeches. I saw an article the other day stating that millions of dollars were raised by Republican and Democrat candidates, and a great amount of that money was raised from donations below $20. The fact that we might be spending millions of dollars on campaigns does not mean that we have to go to companies or corporations or individuals and attract donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars. If we have enough people supporting us and putting small amounts in, we will reach an aggregate that is sufficient for the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from anything else, no-one is forced to spend money in a campaign. The decision as to what is spent by political parties is a decision undertaken by the parties themselves and the individual campaign committees. I have no hesitation in saying that the biggest waste of money in Australia, in my judgment, is that spent on political parties, political candidates and campaign committees at election time, whether State or Federal. The money that is spent is wildly unproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think back to before I came into the Parliament when, for three elections, I was the campaign manager for one of the State seats in Queensland, the seat of Toowong. The average figure for my campaign expenses in the 1970s was $250 for a State seat. Senator Gerry Jones may think back to what he was spending out at Everton or wherever he was. I would think the median figure in those years was $10,000 to $15,000 for a State seat. Being a good Scotsman, I ran that for around $250 for two elections and, for the final one, inflation caught up and I had to put $450 on the budget line to win the seat of Toowong. I have no hesitation in saying that there is a gross degree of waste in campaigns, but that is a responsibility of the individual campaign committees. It does not mean that there is anything wrong with it. If people are silly that way and profligate, that is their business. It is not a crime against the state, as the Labor Party is trying to make it out to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, money is the root of the problem here for both the Labor Party and the Democrats. Senator Loosley was targeted in the press for running the New South Wales Labor Party into the red for $7m this week. It is not right to see it in terms of Senator Loosley's bad judgment. Of course, it was all the New South Wales Right&mdash;it was Senator Richardson and it was the world's best Treasurer, Mr Keating. It was the New South Wales Right which made the tragic miscalculation of the market in New South Wales and ran up a debt of $7m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of the strange ironies of politics that the New South Wales Right has this great conceit that somehow or other it can handle money. It laughs at the New South Wales Left, which it thinks is a bunch of mendicants. It was not the Left that ran up a debt of $7m; it was the bunch known collectively as the New South Wales Right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because the Labor Party is bankrupt that it is desperate to transfer the cost of its campaign to the public purse. As well as being in trouble itself, all its big mates are in trouble. Poor old Laurie Connell is fighting every day before a royal commission. Bondy is trying to live quietly, and pretend he does not know anything about anything. All the money that used to flow in from those people has gone, so the Labor Party is desperate. It wants to bring in a system that will transfer its campaign costs to the public purse, in the way it did with direct mail through the postage allowance for members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another pernicious twist to this. The Labor Party wants to bring in a system that will deny anyone else the opportunity to pay for advertising on television, while it does not have the money to pay for it itself, secure in the knowledge that it can swamp the nightly news broadcasts on television with vacuous statements known as `photo opportunities' by the Prime Minister and the more photogenic of his Ministry. Throughout the election campaign it will be doing this and doing that, making statements of national importance and beating the requirements of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same sorts of motives apply to the Democrats. They are bankrupt. They have never had any money. As Senator Kemp pointed out, this Bill outrageously advantages them. It gives them something like six times more exposure on national television than they had at the last election and, what is even more galling, at no cost. I estimated before that the Democrats would benefit by $18m in free advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of this Bill is the disclosure of funding. As Senator Parer said, we have no problems with this provided it is fair, open and equitable to all parties and provided that opportunities are not presented to the bully boys in the union movement to stand over companies and demand donations. Senator Aulich spoke quite a lot about big business supporting the Liberal Party and the ALP somehow or other having missed out. Having taken the time to access the returns for campaigns through the Electoral Commission, I have positive proof of the huge funding that the ALP derives from the unions. The amount of money it gets from the unions is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a couple of occasions previously in this chamber I have spoken about the way the ALP clearly rorts its own legislation. I have spoken about the 1987 election return from the ALP headquarters in Canberra. After hundreds of thousands of dollars declared as gifts from various workers' unions, tradesmen's union clubs, the Canberra Tradesmen's Union Club, the AMWU National Council political fund and the Operative Painters and Decorators Union, we find at the end of the return to the Electoral Commission an entry for ALP Legacies and Gifts Ltd of 22 Brisbane Avenue, Barton, ACT for a donation of $1,946,348.19&mdash;nearly $2m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have invited Senator McMullan, who was signatory to this when he was the Secretary of the ALP, to explain where that came from. In the absence of any explanation from him, I think I am quite entitled to come to the conclusion that the ALP Legacies and Gifts, with its gift of nearly $2m in the 1987 election, was just a slush fund for the old mates to contribute to the Party without having their names put on the return which went before the Electoral Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short is quite right; it would be par for the course. The Bill which calls for disclosure of donations at the present time was very carefully crafted. One of the things that Senator Aulich had a great weep about was the way that donations could be divided into administration expenses and electoral expenses. Senator Aulich virtually said that the Liberal Party was dishonest and hid donations as being donations for administration and, by inference, took some of its election funding out of the administration donations which were then kept secret. The point I make is that the Act that covers that was brought in by the Labor Government, and it was brought in because the Labor Party could see a way of manipulating the system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Party is full of sanctimonious individuals. I am sorry that Senator Schacht has left the chamber. I have been quoting Senator Evans but Senator Schacht, Senator Sherry, Senator Aulich and all of their colleagues pump themselves up over civil rights; however, their concern for civil rights extends only to nations outside Australia. They are not interested in the Australian population at all. They tour the world, posturing about civil rights and perceived faults in other countries, but they are not prepared to stand up for the maintenance or extension of civil rights to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, again I refer to Senator Aulich and his comments about funding and that if we raise funds we might be involved in making compromises. I remember the case in the Cooke inquiry of a Mr Nick Sherry&mdash;and I am referring to page 209 of the report&mdash;who apparently received a donation from the Queensland AWU which, at that time, was a breach of the law. I can understand that Senator Aulich, coming from Tasmania, would know of that. The law has now been changed by the Labor Government in Queensland but this non-declared donation to Mr Nick Sherry&mdash;who, at the time was running for the Senate and was, I think, the Secretary of the Liquor Trades Union in Tasmania&mdash;was illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps Senator Aulich's sensitivity to what happens when people are raising funds is a product of his background, but I can assure him that most parties in Australia do not follow the practices that were followed on that occasion. While I am on that point, I can think of the time in Queensland when there was a strike by the electrical tradespeople. There was a great fundraising activity, and $40,000 of the money raised to feed the starving children and wives of the strikers went to the State election campaign fund of a fellow who is now in the Federal House for one of the Federal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important Bill which is before us. As I have said before, it strikes at the right of any party in Australia to go to the public and to put its case to them so that they can be informed and can make a realistic choice. It takes us down the path towards a one-party state. It is very easy to imagine that this could be extended to the print medium and to all communications at a future date in the guise of cost saving or anti-corruption. After all, when Hitler was elected in the 1930s, he campaigned very strongly on the basis of law and order, corruption and the lack of decency within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not surprise me at all to hear Senator Schacht, for example, in a year or two saying, `We really don't need to hold elections any more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments in this debate tonight on the Political Broadcasting and Political Disclosures Bill 1991. Much has been said about the main part of the legislation and the main reasons for and against it. I want to pick up on the issue of third party advertising, in particular to make a few points that I think go to the heart of the legislation and to comment on some of the points raised by Senator MacGibbon. In the end, Senator MacGibbon having said his words, I say that he is drawing the wrong conclusion. He actually did correct himself when he spoke of people having a free say because the phrase `a free say' is open to misunderstanding. I suppose I am glad that Senator MacGibbon had the chance to make it clear that he did not mean at no cost in terms of dollars but, rather, that the right to have a say is protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of this debate is about misunderstanding, deliberately or unintentionally, what other people across the chamber are saying. Essentially, we are talking about whether it is fair&mdash;whether it is a matter of civil rights&mdash;that one side, one group or one subset of the community can buy influence at the price of advertising and that this is not able to be countered on behalf of others in the community who would, for a proper examination of the issues, need to hear the alternative view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sought some of the evidence from the election funding and financial disclosure report on the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate held on 24 March 1990, which is an Australian Government Publishing Service document. The list that particularly interested me&mdash;I am sure Senator MacGibbon will understand why&mdash;concerned third party advertising. That list included, amongst others, the Australian Association of Surgeons, the Australian Doctors Fund, the Australian Medical Association New South Wales branch, the Private Doctors Association and the Private Doctors Association North Queensland branch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many more; I hope nobody concludes that I am giving a definitive list. Quite clearly, there are others, such as the Royal Automobile Club, as it was running a campaign about taxes on roads. There are all sorts of other groups, including foresters and so on. The allocation of money is particularly interesting. Some of those sums of money are very large, but if one finds a name that quite clearly seems to indicate a citizen&mdash;an individual&mdash;then one is talking about very modest amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I want to pick up on the medical contributions under this list of third party advertisers. One of those, as I have said, was the Australian Doctors Fund. One of the nice things that happens in this country is that all doctors receive information from time to time. What is nasty is how in fact people know my name and address to send it to me. I have said in this place before that somewhere or other there is a master list of all doctors and we get advised from time to time of all sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Occasionally, we get invitations and, under the letterhead of the Australian Doctors Fund, we were invited to contribute to a fighting fund for the doctors to oppose the wicked socialist government&mdash;this Labor Government that was going to wreck the world as they knew it or, indeed, was threatening to maintain it as it had established it for the last three elections. </PARA>

My point is that some people who can find the money will be able to have a say, and those consumer and community groups and the poorer people in the community will not have the right to have a say and will not be able to get their message across or balance the claims that have been put by one side only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, it is a matter of equity. I am a bit shocked that the Opposition can see no case for equity. It sees no case for saying that, if those people who have a large amount of dollars want to buy the time and put their message across, that is their right but that the right of the community to know the full story, or a balanced view, should also be addressed or provided in some way as a counter to those organisations or groups which can afford the very big dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of health policies, it is quite clear that the Australian Doctors Fund will again be looking for funds. But, after this legislation is passed, we might be able to point out to it that the need is much less. We have seen the Opposition's health document. I have read it very closely. It is a shocking document. It is a return to the 1970s; it is back to Fraser. It is all of those sorts of things that will require a very hard sell, because it is a mischievous, dreadful health policy that will cost individuals and the country more and will add to inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given a health policy like that, of course the Opposition will want the people who will benefit from that health policy to say that it is a good thing; it will want to advise the citizens in a very prejudiced way&mdash;a weighted and biased way&mdash;of the virtues of it. The AMA will be delighted with that health policy and it will want to say that it is a good thing because it will get very much richer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private hospitals are also very interested, having first of all qualified what they thought would be the benefit from the Opposition's proposed health policy, because they were concerned that people would be encouraged to buy private health insurance and would buy the least level of private insurance in order to exempt them from their surplus tax obligations after the Medicare levy. That minimal private insurance entitles people only to private insurance in public hospitals. So, if one were trying to shift people out of the public hospital system into the private hospital system, that minimum level of private health insurance would not do it. That is the Opposition's health policy. The private hospitals were concerned at first. I do not know what conversations they have had since, but they are now in support of the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia is over the moon. This is what it has been waiting 10 years for&mdash;to get rid of the current arrangements that provide equity in health, and a return to the days of privilege for those who can afford it. In an election those large moneyed vested interests are going to do as they have done before, and buy advertising. It would be very expensive for organisations like, for example, the Consumers Health Forum to buy equal time&mdash;indeed, they cannot. The report on election funding and financial disclosure shows that small consumer groups and community organisations are not represented. They do not have the opportunity to put the counter message or counter claim on behalf of the people they represent. They cannot tell the story because to do so would have too high a dollar cost. They cannot afford to have their say;  they cannot afford to have equity of opportunity to speak to people and provide their message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation the right of the public to be provided with the political story is protected through the provision of free time, and the right of consumers to have a balanced campaign presented is also protected. In light of third party advertising expenditure in previous campaigns, I think we have great reason to be concerned and great reason to support the intent of this legislation. I find it amazing that the Opposition wants to argue that this is a denial of civil rights. I do not understand how one can possibly claim that. I can understand the political reasons for doing it but it is a totally unconvincing argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have now had another day to listen to the arguments put by the Opposition in its attempt to make the case for civil rights through the opportunity to buy advertising time. I do not know that enabling the buying of advertising time involves furthering civil rights, because it is not an example of free speech&mdash;it is an example, as a number of people have said, of very expensive speech. It is also a one-sided story; it seems to me to be quintessentially contradictory. I would be interested to hear whether Senator Bishop might like to refute that with argument, not declamation. I suspect it will be the latter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to argue that having the capacity to pay a very large amount of dollars for advertising should in any way be equated with the right to free speech. That is the crux of the matter here. The Government, by introducing this legislation, is ensuring the protection of people's rights, not denying them. I would be interested to hear the contributions of honourable senators opposite, but I do not believe we will be told anything further that will persuade us of the rightness of their case. They just insist with fury that their case is right but they cannot argue it with logic. I do not believe they will be able to bring anything new to this debate through their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The philosophical underpinning of the debate is the critical matter, not the furphies being put forward by the Opposition. We know very well how easy it is to buy influence and we know how easy it is to rort ballots and political influence to effect things, particularly through the power of persuasion, and if we are going to go that way we must guarantee equality. That is not possible under the highly expensive arrangements by which we have to pay for radio and television advertising in this country at the moment, and I look forward to a more equitable and balanced outcome as a result of this legislation which will be in place before the next elections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear Senator Crowley's request that I answer some of the questions she posed. I suppose the point one can best draw a conclusion on is that there are none so deaf as those who will not hear. She said today that she had listened attentively but had not heard anything. I repeat:  there are none so deaf as those who will not hear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Crowley, lest we misunderstand each other, that free speech is unfettered speech. Free speech is speech that is allowed to be made and broadcast and published. What this Government is about, in cahoots with the Australian Democrats, is fettering speech, limiting the right to have that speech broadcast and published. Indeed, it is a type of censorship. Let us again be under no misunderstanding:  what we are seeing here tonight is a conspiracy between two parties&mdash;the Australian Labor Party, which is broke, and the Democrats, who represent only 4 per cent of the Australian population and cannot raise any money. In other words we are seeing a conspiracy hatched between those two parties that are incapable of earning the respect and support of the Australian people and so attract donations in order that they may have their message published and broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the Democrats represent only 4 per cent of the population and yet, under the formula, they will get 10 per cent of the so-called free TV time that will be made available. Earlier this evening Senator Kernot said, with great passion, that the Democrats did not accept 30 pieces of silver. Indeed they did not. They have accepted $1m worth of advertising which is to be paid for by somebody else. As I will go on to point out, there is no such thing as free advertising. Somebody pays, but somebody else gets the benefit. In this case the Australian Democrats, for no trouble at all, for no effort or exertion on their part except stitching up a deal, benefit to the tune of over a million bucks worth of advertising on the media at other people's expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine the whole proposition of this Bill that is somehow meant to bring about an improvement in integrity. I put it to the Senate that we cannot legislate for integrity. What the Australian Labor Party did in Western Australia through its elected representatives there, through Brian Burke and his cohorts, was quite illegal, against the law&mdash;but it did not stop them. What was done when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) attended the infamous gold lunch and did a trade-off was highly immoral, but that did not stop him. We have heard a lot of talk in this chamber about brown paper bags&mdash;but the Labor Party finds that brown paper bags are not big enough. It is into suitcases&mdash;suitcases of money, stamps, gold; you name it. It is all illegal. `Burkegate' has become one of the more infamous things that has ever occurred in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to the concept of what is free. As I have said, there was no such thing as a free lunch and there is no such thing as free advertising. The two alternatives are these:  either the advertising on television which is to be made available is paid for by the shareholders, by way of forgone revenue, or it is paid for by higher advertising fees being charged to those people who advertise in different time slots and who in turn will pass on that cost to the consumers. Thus, instead of the advertising paid for by the people who want to donate money to political parties because they believe in what they stand for and they wish to see their ideas propagated, advertised and broadcast, it is being paid for by the consumers who have no control over it whatsoever. As I said, there is no such thing as free advertising because it is ultimately paid for by either shareholders or consumers&mdash;certainly not by those people who stand to benefit from the legislation, most importantly the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what some of the unintended consequences of this ban will be: that visually impaired, illiterate or semi-literate and aged people will be affected; that people in outlying areas and provincial towns will have to depend solely on biweekly or even weekly newspapers; and that print-handicapped radio stations will have to use extreme caution in transmitting information. The ban could well prevent even the advertising of political meetings to which people might go to find out something. Then there will be the magnificent spectacle of the increased power of the political journalists, who will be in a position to interpret the words of political parties without the political parties or individuals having the right to take paid advertising space and refute points of view that are misinterpreted by those journalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Michelle Grattan put it quite accurately in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a party thinks the media coverage is biased, it will have no way of putting its views on the electronic media independently (outside of news and current affairs programs)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>where again they act as a filter of the words that are put forth. That is hardly, I would think, anybody's understanding of what is free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of the Bill, far from decreasing the cost of running elections, is to increase the overall cost of those elections, because the amount of money which has been available to spend will still be available to spend. In the case of the Labor Party, that amount of money will be used in increasing its direct mail program, again very much at the taxpayers' expense, through its policy, which it has finally got through the Parliament one way or another, of increasing the postage allowance of individual members and senators to allow that direct mail to go out at taxpayers' expense. As I have said, the effect of it will be to add $18m of television advertising, the cost of which is being borne either by the shareholders in those television companies or by the consumers by way of added on cost, because other advertisers will have to pay a greater fee to cover the so-called free time or compulsorily acquired time that is going to be used for political messages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are the Government and the Democrats together in their conspiracy not satisfied with having dictated what time is to be made available, by whom and at what cost; they are also going to dictate the manner in which this information is to be disseminated. We heard a great exposition from Senator Kernot in this chamber earlier tonight in which she told us her vision of how a television political advertisement shall run. These are the sorts of rules that one was used to seeing in place in totalitarian states, in which the government was in complete control of who put what to air, what messages were acceptable and what other messages were not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not extraordinary that this Government, which has been pressed time and time again to put some sort of limitation or restriction on the availability of pornographic videos, will not do so and says that they must be freely available, but is frightened to death of a political message which might expose some of the goings on with visible images of the things that the Labor Party has indulged in. Perhaps it would not like an advertisement that said that Mr Hogg had been convicted of false returns. Perhaps it would not like a visible image displaying Mr Burke and his Burkegate frauds upon the people of Western Australia. </PARA>

The advertisements containing political matter will be restricted at times other than those leading up to Commonwealth, State and Territory elections. With the way that this Government is clamping down on exposing issues in this country, be they wrongdoings or otherwise, it is a wonder it did not also include local government elections in the Bill.

The reasons given for having the ban now cover similar circumstances to those which existed in the 1983 Federal election, the 1984 double dissolution, the 1987 double dissolution and the 1990 election.

All of the conditions that the Government is now putting forward existed then, but there was not a whimper from the Labor Government or the Western Australian Labor Party, in opposition at the time. There was nothing said about it then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between then and now is that money was flowing then from the Labor Party's rich mates for whom it was doing favours. That is why it was not brought up at that time. Now, the money from those rich mates has run out. Those funds are nowhere near as forthcoming as they were. This Government is now trying to prevent the Opposition, the coalition, from exposing the Government to the electorate as the election approaches; exposing it for its wrong actions and its inaction. </PARA>

Had the Prime Minister changed that promise to `no child need be living in poverty by 1990', somebody might have believed him.

What did the character who bought the saleyards do with it?  Within three months, fittings worth nearly $400,000 had been stripped from the premises.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cover-up touches the Hawke Government as well. We certainly know what the Hawke Government has done to ruin Australia. We will not be able to remind the people of the one million unemployed. Fortunately, they will remind the Government in the ballot box. The Labor Party is bankrupt by its own admission and that is why it wants this Bill to be passed:  to get the taxpayers of Australia to pay for the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party in New South Wales, of course, has its own story. It is bankrupt to the tune of $7m. Today it has been issued a demand of delivery for $1m invested in a building plus $450,000 in back rent. It has been mooted that Senator Loosley's investment capabilities have not been too crash hot in the past few years. For his sake and the sake of his young family, I hope that he has not given any personal guarantees. It is probably his first lesson in real estate dealing and it will be a lesson that he will remember for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today there is more bad news for the Labor Government in all directions. Why has this piece of legislation been declared an urgent Bill?  One of the main reasons, apart from the Labor Party throughout Australia being broke, is that there could be some elections around the corner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is bankrupt, as well as the Labor Party, so it might not be too long before we go to an election. Tasmania may have one very soon. I know that the Labor Party in Tasmania is broke. New South Wales may also be in an election mood before very long, and the Labor Party is broke in New South Wales. This Bill has been declared urgent because the Labor Party needs the taxpayers to fund the elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Government is just hanging on with five Independents. Of those five there is only one true Independent; one person who was elected as an Independent. One abandoned a particular Party and the rest abandoned the Government. There could be an election in Western Australia at any time, and the Labor Party there is broke. Mr Connell is nowhere to be seen to provide funds and Mr Bond is fighting the bankruptcy court, so he cannot provide any more funds. The Western Australian Government overspent in the last State election&mdash;just like the Federal Labor Party overspent in its last election. Now the Labor Party is trying to make up ground by getting the taxpayers of Australia to fund their campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the election in Western Australia with Peter Dowding being touted on television in his short sleeves. Short sleeves is generally a sign of people doing work. That would be the first and last time in his life that he has worn short sleeves. Here he was being shown with his family in the park doing this and doing that. That was all heaped up by the Labor Party's rich mates. It got them over the line by 300 votes but what has that cost the people of Western Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What other tragedies around Australia does stopping this political advertising cause?  It stops the peak bodies of industry from advertising to remind the Government of its shortcomings. The NRMA will be prevented from telling Australians about the lack of spending on roads under this Federal Government. Madam Acting Deputy President, you may remember the campaign that the RACs of Australia conducted leading up to the last election, pointing out the state of Australian roads and the lack of spending on them. I remember it very well. </PARA>

Why cannot the Chamber of Mines tell of the Government's inaction on Coronation Hill? There was some action but it was the wrong way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April, when the Democrats and Opposition urged splitting the Bill, the Government was adamant that it was all or nothing&mdash;no ban, no disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the position on 8 August 1991 but, of course, since then we have had a change in the leadership of the Democrats. Senator Powell paid her price for stating that this political advertising ban would proceed on these terms. As soon as a new leader is elected by the Democrats, here we are back to the same old story&mdash;that Senator Powell tried to do something about it way back in April this year. That is how it went. Senator Powell's stand came to an end when she lost her position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this ban on political advertising we will also not be able to tell Australia as a whole about the little tricks the Democrats have been up to in the last year or so. For example, we cannot disclose their overtime bill. The Democrats now need $1.8m to run a budget for the next Federal election&mdash;or whatever other election it may be&mdash;because they have been obtaining their funds through the non-payment of the overtime of staffers. There was a case some time ago where a staffer ran up overtime of approximately $59,000 in eight months. In order to qualify for that I think that the staffer would have had to work about 26 hours a day&mdash;that was the figure I worked out. We will not be able to disclose that. They cannot fight an election on that issue because someone blew the whistle on their overtime bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government wants here is free advertising; that is, the Labor Party wants free advertising because it has run out of money and it has run out of rich friends to get any money from them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have left I will refer to remote areas. The banning of all radio political advertising will affect remote areas the most. Radio is the only true media propagation that can reach every square metre of Australia, the high seas around it and the offshore islands. Although TV may be available through a satellite, the installations must be there or it will not reach those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia alone 426,000 people live outside the metropolitan area and, of those, 156,000 live in remote areas. Under normal circumstances they probably would not get television. These are the people who will be most affected. Many people live in mobile mining camps.

It has done all of those things to cover this up. I will  conclude with a quotation from, I think, Senator Kernot, who stated:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Minister for Administrative Services report to the first normal meeting of Caucus held in the 1990 Budget Session on the proposal to amend the Broadcasting Act to ban all paid TV and Radio advertising for all Federal and State Elections.</PARA>
<PARA>That was carried unanimously. So the issue has been around for many of us for a long, long time. I had the opportunity to speak<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> when the legislation was introduced and, of course, when it was referred to a select committee I was elected by the Senate to chair that select committee. I have spoken already twice on the select committee's report. I must say, of course, that the select committee, dealing with a controversial issue on which very strong opinions were held amongst members of the committee, was at times not an easy committee to chair. But in the end I think all views were heard and expressed very strongly by its members. Naturally I expected, as did happen, that there would be a majority report and a minority report. That was only to be expected, in view of the controversial nature of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I want to comment on was that during the debate Senator Bishop quoted article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. And she was certainly correct in quoting the paragraph which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.</PARA>
<PARA>That was where Senator Bishop stopped quoting. She failed to mention, of course, that article 19 also provides that this is not an absolute right. It may be subject to certain restrictions which are provided by law and which are necessary either for respect of the rights or reputations of others or for the protection of national security, public order, public health or morals. In any society freedom of speech is already curtailed by such restrictions as defamation laws, laws against incitement to racism, laws making it an offence to write graffiti in certain places, and so on. </PARA>

I just want to point out that I am also on another select committee of this Parliament, which is looking at community standards relevant to such services as Telecom's 0055 services. It should not be a surprise to Senator Bishop that some of her colleagues are very hot to trot to use the telecommunications laws to ban and/or restrict the use of 0055 numbers&mdash;a quite legitimate argument in accordance with public morals. I do not know whether I will agree or disagree with what such senatorial colleagues as Senator Walters may suggest on that committee, but we will have that debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is quite clear that Senator Walters and other Liberal senators on that committee agree that there is no absolute right to free speech. They want to restrict it. They want to restrict it in private telephone conversations between adults. They make that quite clear. I do not know whether it is a major issue of free speech, but I would say that it certainly proves that, when it suits them, those opposite support restricting free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When evidence came before the select committee from very prominent international constitutional lawyers, including people called by the Opposition, such as Professor Alston, those opposite made it quite clear that, though they may disagree with the Bill, they did not disagree with the concept that governments have the right to make adjustments to article 19 about the freedom of speech on issues such as the protection of national security, public order, public health or morals. They made it quite clear that it is legitimate for any government to introduce legislation and enact legislation in those areas. They may disagree on a matter of judgment about the impact of this Bill, but they did not disagree that the Government has the right on the issues of public order and corruption to introduce this legislation; and we have done so. And there has been nothing said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the claptrap from the Opposition I have never heard so many conversions to the issue of human rights and of free speech as I have heard tonight amongst those opposite, who, if they were given a compass, a map and three weeks, would not be able to find anything to do with human rights and free speech. Those opposite have never been noted for standing up on the basic issue of human rights, except that occasionally some of them will speak when it suits them politically. Generally, they do not take a broad approach to the issue of human rights. When those opposite say that, because of my interest in human rights, it is hypocritical to support this Bill, I am staggered. When somebody opposite suggests that the violation of human rights in a country like Cambodia is the equivalent of this Bill as an invasion of human rights, it is absurd. That suggestion is made by honourable senators opposite who would never go near Cambodia if they were paid $1m per minute. They would not have the courage to go to a place like Cambodia or South Africa, except that when Senator Bishop goes to South Africa, she goes as a guest of the racist regime of South Africa, stays at the top hotels and meets the rich whites, but she does not go into Soweto or Alexandra townships to see where the blacks live. She only goes as a guest of the white racist regime. And for 20 years those opposite&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to tackle the issue raised by honourable senators opposite about the cost of providing free time. I do not think they realise that the allocation of the spectrum for radio and television broadcasting is done by government regulation. The broadcasting spectrum is a community resource. It can be used only if there is government regulation to ensure that it is efficiently used. Nobody in the broadcasting industry&mdash;television or radio&mdash;dare suggest that there should be no regulation of the broadcasting spectrum, because they know that if there is no regulation there will be jamming, people will cut across each other's signal and there will be chaos. They all want regulation to ensure that their signal, once allocated, is sent out unjammed by any other person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as a consequence, because it is a resource belonging to the community, not belonging in perpetuity to the broadcasting stations&mdash;television or radio&mdash;it is not unreasonable from time to time that the Parliament of Australia, representing the community, should put reasonable obligations on those broadcasters to provide a community service. We do it in a number of ways, and certainly honourable senators opposite are quite willing to argue that those obligations should be there. I instance program standards. People such as Senator Walters and Senator Bishop are more than happy to have a body that sets standards on the content of program&mdash;standards that, it can be claimed, are an infringement of the concept of free speech. I accept that, but I also say that we have every right to set a standard including a community obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators opposite read very carefully the Government's propositions, they would see that the allocation of six minutes a day for the period of an election campaign&mdash;there will be two every three or four years&mdash;is not an onerous cost and, in fact, I think the profitability of the stations would not be affected at all. Even if it were, we are talking about revenue that is probably the equivalent of about half of one per cent of a revenue base of about $1 billion in a three- or four-year period. It is not an onerous cost to the shareholders or whoever owns the television or radio stations. I would point out to honourable senators opposite that, if they read the Government's amendments, they will see that in fact there is no obligation on the radio stations to provide free time. It is only an obligation on the television stations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop and other Opposition senators have been attacking the Australian Democrats, saying that the Democrats will get large amounts of free time when they only have the support of 4 per cent of the population. The free time is allocated on votes, not on population. The Democrats, whether we like it or whether the Liberal Party likes it, at the last election got in excess of 10 per cent of the vote. That is the proportion of free time they should get. I should also point out to honourable senators opposite that, if they read the amendments circulated from the Government, they will see that there is provision for new political parties that have not previously stood candidates to get access to free time. It is made quite explicit in the amendments that have been circulated. I only wish Opposition senators would take the trouble to read the amendments. It is not an onerous task to read. It is not an onerous task to read more than a couple of pages, but I am starting to suspect that it is beyond the mental capacity of some honourable senators opposite to read more than about a page every half-hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude on one matter which honourable senators opposite have been conspicuously silent about, and that is the disclosure provision. Other than an attack on the trade union movement, there has not been one suggestion by them that they want to give the shareholders of any public or private company the right to have a plebiscite to indicate whether they want their money in that company given as a political donation to a political party. Honourable senators opposite demand it of the trade union movement, and details are published every year in union annual reports, but such information is not published in the annual reports of most public companies or private companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Opposition senators were fair dinkum about this point on disclosure, not only would they be putting up amendments in the next 24 hours saying that there should be, in their terms, wider ranging provisions on what unions do in providing donations, but they would also be putting up amendments making it necessary for shareholders in public and private companies to be consulted by way of plebiscite or vote to see whether those shareholders want their company to donate money to a political party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators are not game to do that because the real issue with respect to disclosure is not the issue of intimidation; it is the fact that many company executives do not want to face their shareholders at an annual general meeting with the knowledge that they have given money to a political party. That is what Opposition senators are scared of. That is why they are not going to propose those amendments. Their mates in those companies do not want them to do so because they know that their shareholders will take a very tough attitude to the fact that the money has been given to political parties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope to introduce some calm rationality into debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, which I might say has been sadly lacking in the speech of the previous speaker, Senator Schacht.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> I also wish to introduce some fairness into this debate, which is about fairness and allowing the Australian public to speak their minds. The members of the Australian Labor Party have been attempting all day to stop people speaking their minds. They are attempting by this ban on free speech to stop Australians speaking their minds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to be a member of a party that is prepared to sit here all through this morning and all through tomorrow afternoon to make sure that the people of Australia learn about the scurrilous actions of the Government, of which that lot opposite form part. They are attempting in every way possible to destroy every vestige of free speech in this community. Their actions today in banning free speech, aided and abetted by the sycophants in the corner, is scandalous and it needs to be publicised to the Australian public. I hope that by staying here all night we will get out that message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two preliminary comments to make about the legislation. One is that the lawyers are going to have an absolute field day. Every cent that Senator Kernot and the Australian Democrats think they might save at election time&mdash;the Labor Party, of course, does not believe that&mdash;will be frittered away in legal costs. This legislation is absolutely fraught with constitutional problems. Senator Tate, the Minister representing the Attorney-General, knows that full well. He probably knows full well that this is all for nought because the legislation will be challenged and it is likely to be found to be invalid in very many ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interpreting of this Bill is likely to fill the pockets of lawyers for many, many years. Senator Schacht will probably be happy with that. However, that is what the Bill is doing, and if the Minister had any concern at all about that particular subject he would bring in legislation that means something and not legislation which the courts will have to spend days and weeks and months trying to interpret. In an election period, lawyers will have a field day with the injunctions on what constitutes an offence under this Act and what does not. It will be an absolute bonanza to lawyers. Government senators are facilitating that, and they will end up with egg all over their faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer now to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and to the enormous amount of this legislation that refers to regulations to be drafted in the back rooms by the Government in an attempt to sneak them through in the hope that this chamber will not see them coming and will not be aware of them to take the opportunity to move to disallow them. Every single technical part of this Bill is to be subject to regulations. We do not know how the rules are going to apply. I am sure that when the Australian Democrats have a look at them&mdash;if they can read them then&mdash;they will not understand how they are going to be applied. The regulations will be very, very technical; they are the sorts of things that should be part of this legislation and should be being debated now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before making some comments about the Bill, I wish to refer briefly to the quite amazing speech of Senator Kernot on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It was full of convoluted argument and difficult logic. Coming from someone who calls herself educated, it contained some absolutely amazing things. Her speech showed a complete misunderstanding of the legislation, that she has been completely duped by the Labor Party, the Minister and all of those who stand over her and her colleagues every time a vote is taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her speech contained a scurrilous attack on a person who is not a member of this chamber. She used the coward's castle to malign and defame a very prominent Australian, Professor Ashley Goldsworthy, but in doing so she made an interesting point. If, as she said, Professor Goldsworthy was issuing a misleading press statement which she said was scurrilous&mdash;I do not agree with her&mdash;what will this Bill do to stop that sort of thing? What will this Bill do to stop those sorts of alleged malpractices? Senator Kernot spent half an hour trying to indicate how things were unfair and how they would be better after this Bill was passed. Yet she points out herself that the things that really can in her opinion be misleading are there already and are not even touched by the Bill. That shows the absolute hypocrisy of the Democrats' position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often that I have the temerity to disagree with my Queensland colleague Senator MacGibbon, but I must in this instance because he said that Senator Kernot's speech was thoughtful, considered and logical. I think it was anything but that. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator MacGibbon" NAMEID="YH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGibbon</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. That has clarified it for me. Senator MacGibbon also said&mdash;and I must take issue with him&mdash;that there was no-cost advertising for the Democrats. He may be right that there is no cost for the Democrats, but it is not no-cost advertising, because someone has to pay. I will return to that issue later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her quite amazing speech, Senator Kernot also talked about all the misleading images that television advertising could conjure up in the last 33 days before an election. But she did not say what was wrong with that on the 332 days before that. How can those television images be dishonest and completely confuse and mislead the public in the 33 days prior to an election but in every other part of the year those images are not a problem? The logic of that is just impossible. It is much the same as the entire argument of the Australian Democrats: completely illogical and without any sense at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have not yet picked up that the images on television are to stop 33 days before the election, or 28 days or whenever, or when the proposed date of the election is publicly announced. Surely the senator does not think the members of the Government probably will not wait until about two months into the term and then say: `We are announcing publicly that we are going to have an election in three years time', so that there won't be able to be any advertising in that period. So again congratulations go to the Government and the members of the Labor Party: they have completely conned the Democrats again. They have conned them on the sort of thing they were fighting so hard to avoid, so congratulations. The Democrats deserve the odium that they will get from the people of Australia when they hear about it; the Government has done well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the Committee that looked at this Bill because some aspersions were cast on the Liberal members of that Committee. The Chairman of that Committee was an absolute embarrassment to the Senate. The way he conducted that hearing and intimidated witnesses was an absolute embarrassment and a blight on the Senate's committee system, which over the years has become very well-respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I serve on three committees chaired by members of the Labor Party. Senator Cooney is absolutely fair and scrupulous every time he chairs a meeting. It does not matter whether the witnesses are agreeing with him, violently disagreeing with him, attacking the Labor Party or doing anything else, Senator Cooney chairs the meeting in a very, very fair way. Because we sit on the same committee, Senator Crowley knows that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Foreman is another committee chairman who, when matters arise that his Party does not like, deals with them very fairly in a gentlemanly way, and he allows people to have their say without intimidation and without cutting them off. I also sit on a committee chaired by Senator Maguire. He is an excellent chairman who is very fair and who allows witnesses to have their say without intimidation and without being cut off. I am afraid I cannot say the same for what I saw of the Committee that dealt with political disclosures and the banning of political advertisements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, Senator Olsen and Senator Kemp acquitted themselves quite remarkably on this Committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the case of Mr Sherry, who gave the disgraceful evidence about the situation in Queensland. I have not very often agreed with the former Premier of Queensland, Premier Bjelke-Petersen, but I will say that it was his finest hour when he saved the people of Queensland from the cutting off of power and from all of the problems that could have happened when the unions tried to hold the country to ransom and keep it in darkness. That was his finest hour. The follow-on from that is that a lot of workers in the unions were told by the bully boys at the top of the union that they must go on strike. The workers did not want to, but they were told to go on strike. As a result, they lost their homes, all their furniture and their cars. They got to the stage where they did not even have enough money to feed themselves. So what happened? The union movement&mdash;the bully boys&mdash;went around and said: `Right, everybody, we'll take up a collection to save these people, to give them a bit of money to feed and clothe themselves'. That sounded like a good idea to me. Had I been in the situation, I would have thrown in a couple of bob, because I did not like to see the ordinary workers being penalised by the efforts of the union bully boys.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to what I was saying. It was a disgraceful exhibition. The hat was taken round to buy food for children, and where did that money end up? It went towards the campaign of the honourable member for Bowman. Gee, it hurts me to say `honourable' when that money collected for women and children to buy food was put into his election campaign. What an absolutely disgraceful act from members of that party, yet they come here talking about fairness. Senator Olsen and Senator Kemp performed very well on that committee and showed to all those appearing before it what should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To continue the comments that most of my colleagues have made, we do agree with fair disclosure provisions. We have always said that. Senator Schacht obviously was not listening when many of my colleagues mentioned that we support, and always have done, fair disclosure provisions. They have to be fair, of course. There have to be rules for everyone, not a separate rule for the Labor Party and the Labor Party mates, the people who control the ALP. The rules have to be fair right across the board. We support that, and we always have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to look briefly at some sections of the Bill. I note that the Democrats are not in the chamber, but I do hope that someone might pass on to them a couple of these comments, because I do want them to think long and hard about these. They go very much to the root of the question, and they might just spark a light in the Democrats and make them realise that they have been conned by the Government. The Minister, in his second reading speech only a couple of months ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the bulk of expenditure by political parties on advertising occurs during elections, the proposed ban will operate at all times. If the ban were restricted to election periods, parties and others would buy political advertising and would run campaigns outside the ban period. The problems associated with the need to raise the huge sums necessary to fund campaigns would remain, but apply to mid-term and pre-election period campaigns, which could be expected to take on the importance presently attached to election campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Minister was quite outraged about that, and he wanted to do something about it. He wanted to ban all political advertising, not just in the election period. What has happened? Lo and behold, it has all changed in a couple of months. What was bad before, according to this Government and according to the Democrats, suddenly turns out to be okay. So I just wonder what has happened to that, what was so bad before that now is not bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill goes on to talk about the ban not being intended to include items of news or current affairs, or comments upon the same, or talkback radio. It would almost tempt you to go back into the law, because here is another absolute bonanza for the lawyers. This will certainly be interesting to try to enforce. Can honourable senators imagine all the talkback they are going to get which will not be paid advertising but will be advertising in a different form? All the news items can be free, so you can have all the Labor Party stalwarts in the ABC slanting all the news, as they do nowadays. They will have a great time with this, as will the radio stations the ALP owns. It will be beaut to try to enforce it. The mind just boggles. Government senators are smiling. They understand what they are going to do, and I congratulate them. They have been able to get their way, to make sure they have all the advertising they want. By pulling the wool over the eyes of the sycophants in the corner, they will get it. They have done very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am running out of time, but I will briefly have a look at the charitable organisations. Charitable organisations are defined as public organisations whose objectives are to benefit the public through relief of poverty, the advancement of education, religion, public health or science. Is that not going to be a bonanza for the Labor Party and its lawyers! I will bet that it has already got its lawyers out, setting up a couple of charitable organisations. These charitable organisations will have as their objectives some of those things I have mentioned, but they will be set up as fronts to allow them to get in under this loophole and make a statement about poverty by saying something like, `Look, if you're not forced to be in a union, that may lead to poverty, so, in the pursuit of our objects to stop poverty, maybe we should get on the radio or the TV and advertise that you shouldn't support a party which wants voluntary unionism'. I will bet that the Labor Party has already got the lawyers out looking at that one. Similarly, with the health issue, it will have people out doing that already, and honourable senators opposite will laugh all the way to the election. I think Senator Kernot said that after two elections she might move for something different. Of course, after the next election this will be completely wiped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another provision in the Bill that the amendments will include provisions which proscribe broadcasting of any Government matter on behalf of an incumbent government during the three months preceding the last due date for the expiry of the House of Representatives. So all the Government has to do is call an early election and it can spend all the taxpayers' money advertising all the things that it supposedly has done well&mdash;call the election early and we get away from that provision. So there we go. The Labor Party has put it over the Democrats again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not see anything about allocation of time in this Bill. We do not know what that is all about. That is going to come later, in regulations to be prescribed. Who is going to look after it? The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and, I assume, other public servants&mdash;people who will be chosen, I suspect, for their views, and one might wonder whether their allocations will be fair. I do not want to impute improper motives to them, but it certainly does leave room for that imputation, does it not? It is going to be very interesting to see who decides the allocation, the times and the amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Bill mentions policy launches per party, what does `per party' mean? Does that mean that the Liberal Party will get some publicity for its launch, and then the National Party will get some publicity for its launch? I wonder whether the Democrats have thought about that. Maybe we will even form a Queensland Liberal Party. We might then get a bit of publicity for its launch as well. I wonder whether anyone has particularly thought of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 95DD says that the Tribunal must within the prescribed period&mdash;there we go again&mdash;in relation to an election grant a period of free time to a political party that comprises the official Opposition. It talks about a political party, singular. I do not know how that applies when the Liberal and National parties are currently in coalition. But it then goes on in subclause (3) to say that the period to be granted to the political party, singular, under paragraph (1)(b), which is the one I have just mentioned, is to be a period equal to 40 per cent of the time in respect of that election. The legislation then refers to more than one such party. How can we talk about a political party, and then refer to what will happen if there is more than one such party? It is just going to be an absolute bonanza for the lawyers, an absolute bonanza. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens&mdash;and the Democrats should look at this&mdash;if another little political party pops up just before the election? The Democrats' 10 per cent will not be 10 per cent. If a couple of parties do that, then the Democrats may very well find themselves not with quite a lot of money, as Senator MacGibbon suggested, but with nothing. I wonder whether they have thought about that. I wonder whether the Democrats realise that they are going to be sharing with the Green Party, Senator Vallentine's Party. </PARA>

That is probably right, but it will have an effect on someone. I do not think people have understood this yet.

That is an absolute disgrace to the British system of justice&mdash;property cannot be expropriated without compensation being paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone said before that, because television stations get a licence from government, it is not their property and government can take it back. But, as Senator Panizza quite rightly pointed out, what about taxi licences? Does a government give a taxi licence and then expropriate it for free rides on five out of seven days? That is the sort of thing that was done in Nazi Germany. That is the sort of thing that used to be done in Russia. That is the sort of thing that should be scowled upon in this country. That is why this Government did not want this legislation to be viewed by the people of Australia. That is why it guillotined it through, and that is why it does not want anyone to know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take another example. If a government resumes freehold land, it has to pay compensation. But to get freehold land, people need a grant in fee simple from a government. It is exactly the same as this sort of item, but it would be unheard of in any British justice country. Those things should be thought of and I would hope that, in the limited time left to the people of Australia to look at this, they will consider that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally&mdash;and regrettably my time is running out&mdash;I want to say this to the Australian Democrats: we expect this behaviour from the Labor Party, a party that Tom Burns calls mongrel dogs creeping around the alley, or whatever it was. We expect it from a party that bashes its people in Sydney. We expect it from a party that gaols Cabinet Ministers. We expect it from a party that has Burke and the bully boys of the Labour Council. We expect this sort of thing from a party which has its officers&mdash;and I am too polite to mention anyone in this chamber&mdash;brought before a court for breaches of the Electoral Act. We expect this from a party that uses the standover tactics that I mentioned in the SEQEB matter in Queensland. We expect this from a party whose Prime Minister tells deliberate lies to Paul Keating, saying that he can lead it into the next election, and then on the same day tells the people of Australia that he will be leader at the same election. </PARA>

We do not expect it from a party that was principled in the days of Michael Macklin. We do not expect it from a party that was principled in the days of Janine Haines. We do not expect it from a party led by Janet Powell, who, for all her failings, did not come at this sort of rort and was not conned by these people. </PARA>

They did this when they rejected convention and elected another member of the Labor Party to the Deputy President's position in this chamber. They were bought off then and they continue to be bought off, not for 30 pieces of silver but for some overtime for their staff and for a few extra staff. I have a little speech on that that I will give one day, with a few facts to back it up. The Democrats get the extra staff, they get treated better than anyone else, and one might ask why. He who pays the piper calls the tune&mdash;that is exactly it. The ALP Government pays the piper and, boy, does it call the tune when it comes to the sycophants in the corner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have expected better from them. I do not expect better from the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who cannot even speak civilly in this chamber. That is what we expect from him. However, I did expect better from the party of Don Chipp. I only hope that, in the last few hours left to them, they will come to their senses and follow the example of Senator Sowada, who has shown a real understanding of the major issues involved. I just hope that Senator Sowada can convince her colleagues of the enormous trap they are falling into, of the absolute disgrace they are going to bring on their party, and the absolute detriment they are going to cause to the freedoms that the people of Australia have come to expect and enjoy. </PARA>

It is clear they are thick around the head because they just do not understand political reality.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that it is the people who live in the sewer who can never smell the effluent: that is the problem with the Labor Party. Because they live in the sewer and were brought up in the sewer, they can never smell the effluent&mdash;the stench of dung that surrounds their shady political dealings. Hopefully, we have had enough of the little boy lost in the corner. Let us get on to the subject of the legislation because, unlike Senator Schacht, I am actually interested in discussing this legislation. I am actually interested in exposing the rorts and frauds of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, let us have some background on this Bill because I think that background is very interesting. It is a long time since the `Burkegate' inquiry began, but we should just cast our minds back and remember that this Bill was introduced by the Australian Labor Party when the `Burkegate' inquiry got a little hot for it. It was introduced when honourable senators on this side exposed the shady dealings of the Labor Party. The real genesis of the Bill that Senator Bolkus brings before the Senate is not based on some high principles about saving the world from corruption. What it is really based on is the principle of saving the Labor Party from the exposure of its corruption. When we remember that, we start to realise that all of the Labor Party's rhetoric, all its sophistry about how it is going to take corruption out of the political process, is nothing but hollow words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear often from people like Senator Schacht and other Labor senators that this Bill is essential to take corruption out of elections and that this Bill is essential to take corruption out of the political process. But nobody on that side of the chamber has yet managed to find one instance of corruption in the political process in the field of advertising&mdash;not one. And they cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listen to the silence. All the interjections have ceased on the other side because those opposite know that the truth is that there has been no corruption in advertising in the electoral process. They know exactly what I mean. They know that there is no corruption to which they can point and which this Bill will rectify. They know that there is no corruption, save one exception&mdash;the exception of Mr Hogg. I will come to him in a little moment. There is not one incidence of corruption in advertising in election campaigns that this Bill would eliminate. They know the truth, but the truth hurts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just discuss for a moment the one single example of corruption in the electoral process that this Bill would address. It is interesting that this is a government that says it wants to stamp out corruption. The way it stamps out corruption is by making its corrupt activities legal. Those opposite do not make it illegal; they do not make it tougher or more difficult to be corrupt. What do they do? They make their own corruption legal. It is interesting that in this Bill there is a provision for disclosure changes. These provisions are in what I will refer to as the Hogg clause because that is what they are all about; they are about Bob Hogg. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have their snouts in the trough, indeed&mdash;not just their snouts but their paws as well, because they are covered in mud and in the stench of their own corruption. I refer to the addendum to the amendments and new clauses circulated by the Government. At the very last moment the Government thought it might do something about the activities of Bob Hogg and its other unelected mates. It has, in terms of returns on electoral expenditure, a new clause 14A which amends section 309 of the principal Act. This is interesting. The new clause states, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person is not required to furnish a return under subsection (4) in respect of an election if the total amount of the electoral expenditure incurred in relation to the election by or with the authority of the person, being electoral expenditure of the kind referred to in paragraph 308(1)(h), is not more than the prescribed amount and if the total amount of the electoral expenditure incurred in relation to the election by or with the authority of the person, being electoral expenditure other than that to which paragraph (a) applies, does not exceed $200.</PARA>
<PARA>So what the Labor Party can do is get lots of little Labor Party minions to each spend $199 on an election campaign or portions of an election campaign and it does not have to disclose it. Or it can set up lots and lots of little entities that each spend $199, or maybe even $199.99 if it wants to push it right to the line. Of course, then it does not have to disclose it. It is very convenient for the Labor Party. It is very convenient for its mates. The only possible incidence of corruption in advertising and in the process of the electoral campaign is the one that the Government makes legal. It is its own corruption. There we see the rub. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many other flaws in the whole concept of this Bill that I think need addressing here tonight.

I want to discuss this question of primary industry and what the Government can do if the Schacht theory of the world is really correct. The Government can require people to hand over produce and it can require people to hand over assets&mdash;that is the Schacht theory of the world. Of course, the thing is&mdash;and honourable senators on this side of the chamber know it&mdash;that the Government is already working towards that with its ridiculous and ludicrous taxation system that takes most of the profit of the labour of ordinary Australians away from them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about the profits of people's labour and the very wise and perspicacious interjection by my friend Senator Panizza, who talked about the taxi driver. It is true that, under the Schacht view of the world, the Government can require the taxi driver to give free carriage to people all over the place. This is an extraordinary view, given that, in the ordinary legal understanding of the powers of appropriation and commandeering in this country, those powers are available only in time of war. But Senator Schacht, the great defender of civil liberties and human rights, says, `No, that is all right: provided the Government regulates some portion of the business activity, it can make them do what it wants'. It is interesting, because this Government already tries very hard to make the media do what it wants. We will get to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see the intrinsic flaw running through this legislation and running through the thought processes&mdash;limited though they may be&mdash;of the people on the other side of the chamber: `We are going to require the media industry to do just what we want because it suits us and because it suits our own shabby political end'. I suppose that, if this Government ever decides to make prostitution legal in Australia, it might even require the prostitutes to give the benefit of a couple of days service free of charge. We can see the flaws in the logic of people on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht earlier on today made another incredible observation. He said that, just because there were regulations or prohibitions on certain types of electoral advertising in other parts of the world, it was fair enough to do it in Australia. Senator Schacht chose a couple of examples from the Western world, but one could equally have taken some examples from less satisfactory places in which one can live, such as Uganda or some of the other dictatorships around the world, such as the Soviet Union and Bulgaria before the fall of the communist government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these were perfect examples, perfect cases in point, of the proposition that Senator Schacht was advancing. Of course, they were perfect cases in point because they relied upon the same flawed and failed communist ideology that Senator Schacht unwittingly embraces in what he says here in the chamber. There one sees the ultimate end for this country if we embrace the Schacht point of view or this Government's point of view: there will be no right for individuals to conduct their businesses as they may because they will have to do whatever the Government wants. They will be at the beck and call of their political masters, notwithstanding the fact that they may indeed, as most of the population of this country does, despise those political masters. That is the cruel thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is a massive provision in the regulations for much of the activity that is created by this Bill to be governed by regulations. The Government, in bringing this Bill before the Senate, asks us to cave in&mdash;to sign a blank cheque&mdash;and to pass this Bill without seeing what the regulations are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those regulations are intrinsic to the operation of the Bill because they will determine and prescribe the manner in which this so-called free political time&mdash;and I will get on to that shortly&mdash;will be allocated. There is an interesting passage in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> about such points of view. In 1 Corinthians 14:8-9 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what this Government is doing. It is speaking into the air and it is speaking about how it is going to regulate the air. Indeed, the reason why this Government has hidden all the machinery of the legislation in regulations rather than the Act is well explained by verse 8 which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</PARA>
<PARA>The reason the Government has hidden the machinery in regulations which it has not brought before the chamber at this time is that it does not want the people to see exactly how it will work. The Government wants to try to pull the wool over our eyes. It wants this chamber to pass this legislation without knowing what it is doing. We on this side of the chamber in the coalition parties&mdash;in the National Party and amongst our very good friends, the Liberal Party&mdash;are not going to do that because we believe in freedom, democracy and in seeing the legislation in full before we pass it. That is why we are so opposed to it here this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another interesting matter which relates to regulations. I refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Delegated Legislation</EMPHASIS> by Professor Pearce at page 10 where he quotes from an article by Jaffe in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Essay on Delegation of Legislative Power</EMPHASIS> (1947) 47 Colombia LR at 361. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Power should be delegated where there is agreement that a task must be performed and it cannot be effectively performed by the legislature without the assistance of a delegate or without an expenditure of time so great as to lead to the neglect of equally important business.</PARA>
<PARA>This Government tells us that this Bill is urgent and that it is the most important business that it has to deal with before this Senate gets up for Christmas. So there is no argument that says that the Government should have the right to delegate the operation&mdash;the machinery&mdash;of its legislation to regulation, because clearly in Jaffe's argument it has to be pushing aside legislation which is as equally important as this. Government senators have told us here&mdash;Senator McMullan told us yesterday morning&mdash;that there was nothing so important as this Bill. There one sees the rub that they failed to take the appropriate measures to put this through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is riddled with clauses that give cart blanche to the ABT and to the Government in framing its regulations to do as it wants, knowing full well that it will be more difficult for those of us opposed to this Bill to amend the regulations than it would be to amend an Act, because the Government knows that it can hold a gun to the Senate chamber and ensure that it gets exactly what it wants or nothing gets put in its place at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can see this whole device of the regulations is a very shameful attempt on the part of the Government to hide from the people of Australia what it intends to do in this Act. For those of us in the coalition who wish to represent the people of Australia, for those of us like my friend Senator Panizza in the coalition who wish to speak up as democratic representatives of our States and say, `We are appalled at this disgusting legislation', the really atrocious crime that is being perpetrated is not, I suppose, the masking of the machinery in the regulations, but it is the fact that this Senate to do its job is sitting at 1.45 a.m. It is the fact that this Senate to do its job has been told it had to sit through the wee hours of the night because the Government members and their friends the Democrats did not want this to be debated in the day. They did not want the press to be able to report what was going on; they did not want the people to know; and they did not want people to be able to protest about what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very strange that Senator Burns frequently protests about his supposed lack of freedom of speech and civil rights in Queensland, yet he is participating in a government that is going to single-handedly&mdash;with one stroke of the pen&mdash;strike a bigger blow to freedom of speech and civil liberties than has ever been done in the political history of this country, with the possible exception of the Eureka Stockade. That is the sort of thing that is going on. Is it not ironic that Senator Burns is not in the chamber? I wish he were so that I could tell him exactly how appalling this legislation is. Those of us on this side perfectly understand what freedom of speech and civil liberty are all about, but this Government does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the greatest joke of all is the Minister who introduced this legislation, the Minister who came in here with sophistry last year about how speech is not free if it has to be paid for. For the edification of the chamber, there is an interesting quote from Byron, and it is a shame that the Minister is not here because I am sure he would be incapable of reading it for himself. I would love to read it to him, but I shall read it instead to the chamber because it aptly describes not only Senator Bolkus but also his apologist, Senator Schacht. I suppose this could be addressed to the media industry. Byron wrote in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">On a Change of Masters at a Great Public School</EMPHASIS> in 1805:</PARA>

I suppose what Government members were really after was a patsy and a fall guy. They certainly got one in Senator Bolkus.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the remainder of my speech I want to address some of the particular absurdities that are in this Bill. For example, there is a contradiction in this Bill. Section 95B(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A broadcaster must not, during the election period in relation to an election or a referendum, broadcast any matter (other than exempt matter) for or on behalf of the government, or a government authority, of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems clear enough, except a little further down the page subsection (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to section 95E, a broadcaster must not, during the election period in relation to an election or a referendum, broadcast a political advertisement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) for or on behalf of a person other than a government or government authority; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) on his or her own behalf.</PARA>
<PARA>What is that supposed to mean? Is it saying in one subsection that the Government cannot advertise, then three subsections later that the Government can advertise? This is the absurdity of how poorly drafted this legislation is. It is riddled with holes. I only picked this page out at random and yet I found a flaw leaping out of the page at me. Like some sort of Government Fosbury flop, this flaw in the legislation leapt out at me. In fact, not only is proposed new section 95B(4) contrary to proposed new section 95B(1), but interestingly enough it is also contrary to proposed new section 95A(1), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to section 95E, a broadcaster must not at any time broadcast a political advertisement, whether for consideration or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA>So, of course, we can see that the whole legislation itself is contradictory. One portion of the legislation contradicts another portion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald was absolutely correct in saying that this is going to be a bonanza for the lawyers, because the number of challenges that will arise to this legislation will be quite incredible. For example, we are going to have awful trouble when we look at regulations for the allocation of the 10 per cent amongst parties other than the Government and the Opposition parties and at what is going to happen if we get five or six or so parties popping up. The Democrats may in fact get their extra $1.5m of free advertising, but then they may not. It is all up in the air. If I were a Democrat, I would really be quite worried about the blank cheque that I was signing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is another group of people signing a blank cheque, and that group consists of the people who conduct the television stations and the radio stations around this country. This is not free advertising; this is advertising that is conducted by the broadcasters on behalf of the Labor Party and on behalf of the Democrats&mdash;but particularly on behalf of the Labor Party. It is the broadcasters' money that is being put on the line. Of course, the argument from the Government is that it is terrible that political parties should be able to buy advertising time. We think it is even worse that political parties should be given advertising time at the expense of somebody else. Some of us on this side have enough difficulties, as it is, with the concept of public funding of advertising. But it is typical of this Government to go from socialism to communism and to say, `Public funding is not good enough.

Of course, there is no right here for the shareholders in those broadcasting companies to vote whether they are going to give the Labor Party or the Democrats some advertising time at their expense, because this Government is holding a gun to their heads and saying that they must give them the advertising time. We can see there the hypocrisy of people like Senator Schacht. He has popped up down there; he is running away from the heat at this end of the chamber.

It will deny them the right to say to people what they think about what is going on in this country. I suppose that is highlighted most particularly in the supplementary explanatory memorandum circulated by the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus. The outline in the second last paragraph of the first page says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is further amended to enable advertisements to be broadcast for or on behalf of charitable organisations, where the advertisement promotes the objects of the organisation and does not explicitly advocate voting for or against a political party or a candidate or a group of parties.</PARA>
<PARA>That is saying: `You can have a view but in this Labor-run Australia you are not allowed to tell people what your view is'. I suppose that is consistent with a party that runs its own internal affairs by having show and tell ballots so that they can have a secret and personal opinion provided they share it around with their mates. This is Labor Party largess at its best. That is what it is going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another honourable senator on this side of the chamber has briefly discussed the possibilities that are going to arise with so-called sham charitable institutions. In case honourable senators do not believe that there is a fair possibility that we will have sham charitable institutions, I should just remind the Senate of the difficulties that were experienced in this country some six years ago when a scam flourished throughout the accounting profession whereby accountants set up bogus charitable trusts. There were primary beneficiaries of the trust, secondary beneficiaries of the trust and tertiary beneficiaries of the trust. Then there was an ultimate or residual beneficiary of the trust that was made to be a charity like the Royal Flying Doctor Service or the Salvation Army or St Vincent de Paul. What that enabled one to do was to claim that the income of the trust was all charitable income and was not subject to the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are going to see spring up is a whole new spate of bogus, charitable trusts set up by the Labor Party and their mates and&mdash;in time they will cotton onto it&mdash;the Democrats and their mates. The primary beneficiary of the trust may well be the Australian Labor Party, but the ultimate beneficiary of the trust, after every single member of the Australian Labor Party has been exhausted, will be the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Then this bogus charitable trust can put advertisements on TV and say, `We think that the Labor Party has done a pretty good job for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and other people generally'. Provided the trust's advertisement does not say that people should vote for the Labor Party, this sham charitable trust or this sham charitable organisation can run its sham charitable advertisements. We all know they are not advertisements for a charitable institution; the only body to which these advertisements are charitable is the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters I wish to refer to in dealing with this Bill this morning. I do not intend to argue the whole case as it has been put by members of the Opposition quite adequately during the course of the debate to this point. I agree with the criticism of the Bill, its substantial faults and, of course, the drafting faults that have been referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that I want to specifically refer to relates to the use of radio and the fact that, along with television advertising, radio advertising will also be banned. I ask the Government to seriously reconsider this. On the financial side alone, of course, radio advertising is less expensive than television, but radio is a very important means of communication for a lot of people in this community. The print handicapped are, of course, foremost amongst those. Without access to radio there is a lot of information that they are not able to get in the way that other people are. That is one reason why information ought to be able to be made available over the airwaves in that fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people in remote areas who either do not get newspapers or get them irregularly and who rely on radio for information as well. The Labor Party, perhaps, is not out in the workplace enough to know that many people have the radio on in the places where they work and it is a very significant means of their getting information and finding out what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people who work the sorts of hours that do not allow them to sit at home reading the newspapers in the morning before they go to work; who do not have jobs where they can sit at a desk for half the day reading a newspaper to find out what is going on; who work hours that do not enable them to get home in time to watch the news and the current affairs programs on television. Some people perform shift work, which means that they are permanently at work at that time and do not get to see television news, current affairs programs and other things that other people might be able to see. For them, in their cars and at their place of work, communication by radio is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find absolutely astonishing in this debate is that this Senate, this Parliament, would be pursuing a course which would preclude voters from getting as much information as they can, by way of advertising, talkback, newspapers, television&mdash;by any way possible&mdash;about the country and about the people whom they are going to vote for. I do not believe that we can have a true democracy if information is cut off from people. It is only by the electorate being well informed that we will obtain a vote that is meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it incredible that we are sitting here contemplating cutting off information to people. If we do they will be less well informed and ignorant of the issues. They will not even be able to have the benefit of the sort of advertising that we can get on radio, which frequently provides much more information than television because we can afford to have longer advertisements. We can have advertisements on radio which can, to a limited extent, even argue a case and put forward a proposition. I would ask the Government to reconsider this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of elections would be significantly curtailed if we were allowed only radio advertising. I do not approve of the cutting out of television advertising but I think a particular case can be made. I would appeal to the Democrats to consider this. I listened very carefully to Senator Kernot's contribution and she did not seem to declare herself on the question of radio advertising. By the time this debate is completed, I hope that the Democrats will see that it is important and ought to be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that there should be free advertising on radio, because I do not approve of the concept of free advertising. As has been said, there is no such thing as free advertising. I am not advocating that the Bill be amended to require the same kind of requisition of time for radio as is being imposed on the television networks. This is something that ought to be paid for by those who are using it. There is no justification for requisitioning people's property in this way. If property such as dirt and buildings were being requisitioned, there would be an outcry if it were not paid for and the owners properly recompensed. But somehow the Government seems to think that it is quite proper to requisition time for its own purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would refer you, Mr Deputy President, to section 51.(XXXI) of the Constitution, which I think is particularly interesting. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is generally understood in this country that proper compensation should be paid for property that governments requisition. I do not see how one can then distinguish between the right of television stations and other owners to be properly recompensed for the acquisition of property as a result of legislation passed by this Parliament&mdash;in this case, legislation to enable the political parties to obtain free advertising. I would be interested to see whether that particular point is, in fact, followed up. I can see no reason why the Commonwealth Government should be able to requisition the property of the TV stations in this fashion and require them to give free advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been making two points. Firstly, I challenge as to whether or not it is constitutionally valid to requisition property in the fashion that the Government is seeking to do in relation to television stations. Secondly, I most certainly advocate that those who wish to convey a message by radio should be able to buy the time to do so. It is taking this matter too far to ban advertising on television and radio. I urge the Democrats to think very seriously about what that would mean for a lot of people in our community. Indeed, I think if we are pursuing a path which means that the electorate generally will be less well informed, we are not doing democracy any favour at all. It would be a great pity if that were the result. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why the rush? That is the first question that was addressed 24 hours ago when we began this two days of disgrace. I would like to give my views about that. The Government tabled in the Senate on Monday night 37 amendments to a Bill that has been in circulation for some six months&mdash;37 amendments to give shape to the significant decisions contained in the legislation. Today it brought down 14 more amendments. Members of the public have not seen one of those 14 amendments and perhaps only a dozen or a score of them would have seen the 37 amendments introduced yesterday. Yet, what we are debating is going to affect every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why the rush? I believe that the Labor Party is being totally cynical. It is learning from its experience with the Australia Card. The Australia Card debate began with the Labor Party doing the same thing as it is doing now&mdash;pulling the wool over the eyes of the people of Australia. It was only because we were able to refer that proposal to a committee of inquiry and cause some months delay&mdash;people were given a chance to wake up to its deficiencies&mdash;that the public then started to generate the kind of momentum which eventually saw that measure defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Labor strategists have looked at this measure and seen the same potential for defeat if ever the Australian public were informed about it. So without any warning, the substance of the Bill was brought before us on Monday night. We have to have the whole debate over and done with by Wednesday night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now nearly 2.20 on Wednesday morning on the second day of the debate. I think about 20 speakers have already spoken in this debate&mdash;and I see from the list that is in front of me that there are still a dozen to go. All speakers are of the view that this legislation ought to be brought to the attention of the Australian public and that it should not serve the self-interest of the Labor Party, which is pulling the wool over the eyes of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that this legislation has been guillotined is only secondary. About 24 hours ago, Senator Ray argued that all governments have guillotined and `who is going to say whether a guillotine will be used in this chamber or the other chamber in the future'. He was trying to argue that, because the guillotine has been used in all sorts of circumstances, it is right for the Labor Party to use it in this circumstance. I just totally disagree with the use of the guillotine in this circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had legislation which had been widely circulated in the public, which had been widely debated and on which views had been well formed and then there was an attempt by a section of either chamber to cause some extraordinary delay, it would be possible to consider some way to overcome that delay. But in this circumstance to use the guillotine when the matter has not been brought to the public's attention is reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot, in her speech, thought that the problem was that the Senate had only two days for the debate. Frankly, that also is secondary, in my opinion. Even if the Senate had three, four or five days for this debate, I would still want to move an amendment, which I hope will still be successful later today, to have this whole matter adjourned for three months to enable the public to understand what is at issue. Three months is the kind of practical period that would be involved if the Senate were to defer this legislation because, of course, the Parliament is likely to rise before Christmas, even though it will come back on 2 January 1992 to meet with President Bush. But it will regularly sit again only in late February and we could only guarantee that this would be dealt with during the month of March. That is a period of three months from now.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, of course, is crying crocodile tears that, in giving those resources to Labor members of parliament, it would have to give similar resources to other members of parliament. But it is saying, `Well, firstly, we are in a majority in the House of Representatives. We are on the ground in more electorates than they are and we will use these resources because that is the only way that we can get some kind of advantage. Certainly, we cannot get an advantage on television. We are dead unpopular with the electorate; they will never give us the money. Secondly, we are broke, anyway. Even if we did have some success with fund raising, it would only be to pay off our debt; and, thirdly, we fear terribly what the Liberal and National parties would do to us in a television campaign'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just think of the advertisements that we would run to expose the way in which the Hawke-Labor Government has failed this country&mdash;failed it by a recession; not only a recession that is hurting the people of this country but a recession, the Government says, that we in Australia had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, this Government has created nearly a million unemployed. It is a tired government with a divided party and a failing Prime Minister. The huge weakness is that the Labor Party does not want to see the Liberal-National Party having the usual television campaign options for attacking the Government in the next Federal election. So it denies everybody; it denies both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray has just come into the chamber at 2.30 a.m. I reiterate for his benefit that I believe that the Labor Party is being cynically self-interested in learning from the Australia Card debate that, if it gives the Opposition a three-month start in getting the real essence of a Bill to the public, the public will wake up to it and throw it out. If this Bill were given a three-month break, there would be the same consequence. That is why the Government is pulling the wool over this Senate chamber and over the public of Australia by getting a debate all over in two days. It is a disgraceful situation because it is directly and cynically serving the self-interests of the Labor Party and, as it happens, of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will continue with my reasons. The fifth is that the Labor Party has lured the Democrats up the garden path by appealing to their idealism. The Democrats have been on record for some time as wanting to resist and reject United States television excesses in election campaigning. The Labor Government has felt that it can appeal to that idealism and distort it, in the words of this Bill, to try to keep them onside and to form an alliance that will get its purposes achieved with Democrat support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also, I think, taken the Democrats up the garden path with an appeal to Democrat realism&mdash;that at long last the major parties will not be able to bring onto television the same firepower that they have in the last 20 years of elections, which the Democrats cannot match. The Democrats cannot match it because they are not popular and because they have not got the funds. People do not give them the money. They are not supported by the Australian public to the extent that they can go about a television campaign. So, there is this realism in the Democrats' assessment of the situation that they will be better off by the major parties being pulled back to their line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a sweetener as well for the Democrats; that is, the Government is offering to the Democrats 10 per cent of the so-called free time on television during election campaigns. When that is calculated, it is an increase in television time for the next election compared with the time that the Democrats actually experienced in the last election. That is a sweetener that the Democrats find very hard to overlook. It is why it is felt by so many in this chamber&mdash;and I believe there will be an overwhelming roar out there in the public in the coming months&mdash;that the Democrats are acting in their own self-interest. I am not saying that they are as blatantly cynical as Labor senators opposite. I believe that they have actually been taken up the garden path by Senator Bolkus and other Ministers of this Government, and that they have been lured to agree to a package, to form an alliance. But it is undeniable that this Bill and the outcome of this alliance are the direct self-interest of the Labor Party and the direct self-interest of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In summary, I will draw an analogy. Yesterday morning when we first began discussing this matter, there were in the galleries large numbers of school children. The thought occurred to me that they would understand what a sprint race at their own sports day is about. When the best runners are preparing for a race, they all start on the same line, they are not allowed to have steroids and other drugs and they are not allowed to have false starts. The starter has two guns, and if anyone jumps ahead of the line everybody in the school knows that they have to have a second start because it is not fair to break such a rule. But they would expect that the first one over the finishing line would be the winner. They would understand the concept of the school bully who, seeing that he does not have a chance of winning the running race but still aspiring to do so, decides to bind his own arms behind his back, to tie his legs together and then to change the rules by all sorts of pressure before the race to ensure that all the other starters in the race, even the ones who are fit and who have been training, will have to have their arms tied behind their back and their feet tied together so that the race becomes one of only hopping down the 100 metres to the finishing line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Labor Party has made itself so unpopular with the Australian public and would be at such a disadvantage were the contest to involve television campaigning, it has by this Bill adopted the tactic of the schoolyard bully to rig the coming sports day race by getting everybody in the race to have his hands and legs tied so that the race is not a sprinting race at all. It is my view that this Bill is a self-serving instrument of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. I urge the Senate to reject it entirely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, in its current form, maintains one of the characteristics that it had before it was sent off to the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures. The characteristic is that it contains a blanket ban and it represents a gross infringement of one of our most fundamental human rights: that is, our right to speak and to be properly informed. This latest proposal does exactly the same thing as the original Bill. The Government's reasoning for this latest revamped proposal also remains unchanged. It is being introduced, as many of my colleagues have said, for blatantly political purposes as part of Labor's desperate and last-ditch attempt to hold on to its power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pertinent to assess the political climate in which this Bill has been brought in and is being rushed through the Senate. It is being rushed through in that it has come in with amendments. Had this Bill come to the House in June and not come to the Senate with the amendments that are proposed, then I do not think we could claim in the same way that we are claiming that it is being rushed through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But why is the Government rushing it through the Senate? Why does it want this Bill? We have a government which has admitted that, under Mr Keating, it engineered a recession, a recession which we had to have but which is the worst we have had in 60 years. We have a government which is in the death throes of a leadership struggle that has now been going on now ad infinitum for years and has come to a fever pitch in the last 12 months. As a result of the recession that we had to have, we have had a multitude of misleading statements from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)&mdash;such as no child would live in poverty by 1990 and there would be no recession&mdash;and we have had the Kirribilli deal, to boot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is on the nose with no re-election prospects and it is grasping at anything it can cling to. We have heard people tonight saying that the New South Wales section of the Australian Labor Party is virtually bankrupt and that, with almost no hope of replenishing its stocks, it has to cling to something; and this is one way it is going to try to cling to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have the Australian Democrats supported this guillotine? They have moved radically to the left of the political spectrum in a desperate bid to find a political niche for themselves. They have failed to maintain their high profile since the departure of Senator Chipp and Senator Janine Haines. We have seen Senator Powell deposed because she was said not to have a high profile. I bet my bottom dollar that a hundred Democrats will get together and depose Senator Coulter in due course because he has not raised the profile of the Democrats. Like the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats have been hamstrung by internal leadership crises which continue, just as the crises of the Labor Party continue, and which are going to paralyse the Democrats as they have paralysed the Labor Party. With the takeover and the new leadership by Senator Coulter, the Australian Democrats are also going to become a one-issue party, given Senator Coulter's background and interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of 1991, both the Labor Party and the Democrats are fighting for their political survival. In this battle the stakes are very high. This advertising ban, both as it was originally drafted and in the current form, is a classic case of the end justifying the means. As the stakes have risen, it has become a case, not of how the Labor Party holds on to power, but of ensuring that it does hold on to power. Labor has become a win at all costs party with its bed fellows, the Australian Democrats, going along with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession we had to have shows that the Government does not care who gets hurt on the way, as long as it keeps winning. This legislation, which I believe is despicable, shows that the Labor Party does not care what fundamental rights are infringed, so long as it wins. I am not sure now when this latest proposal was introduced&mdash;whether it was last night or the day before but, when it was introduced, it had 37 amendments, and I think an additional 14 have been brought in since we have been involved in the debate today. I have no doubt that human rights practitioners such as Burdekin would have expressed the view that this latest proposal infringes the fundamental right of free speech&mdash;if the Government had done the right thing and provided sufficient time for effective community consultation on this amended Bill. That is what we are arguing about: the fact that there has not been sufficient consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects to the right of free and unfettered speech. Firstly, it assumes that every citizen should have the right and the opportunity to speak. Secondly, it assumes that citizens should have a right to be able to be properly informed about matters that affect them. In short, free speech involves a freedom to hear as well as a freedom to speak. Both these fundamental rights are infringed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two effects of this legislation which I find particularly galling. Firstly, this Bill will allow government departments and statutory authorities to continue their multi-million dollar self-serving and self-promoting campaigns which are, in effect, political campaigns for the government in power. The legislation will allow those campaigns to go on virtually unabated. During 1989-90, Federal government agencies spent $232m on these campaigns. I recognise, as we all recognise, that a lot of that advertising is justified. But a lot is not justified, and a lot of it is politically motivated. One has only to look at the $1.4m per annum that the taxpayer spends funding aNiMaLS, the National Media Liaison Service, and its weekly propaganda newsletter `Focal Point' to understand the extent of this Government's propaganda machine and the way it uses taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are debating disclosure, corruption and political advertising, I think we should remember that the National Media Liaison Service was caught red-handed assisting the Queensland Australian Labor Party leader, Mr Goss, in 1989 during the Queensland election campaign. The Treasurer, Mr Kerin, sent a letter to Mr Goss offering the assistance of  aNiMaLS in media monitoring during the State campaign. This was a blatant misuse of taxpayers' money in campaigning. I think you would have to agree with me, Mr Deputy President, that that was an abuse of taxpayers' money on a campaigning technique. A similar offer was made for the South Australian campaign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have to tell Senator Schacht that the Government is so low that it would do that. I do not need to teach him dirty tricks. It was quite noticeable before the 1990 election that the Government had decided to step up its ongoing self-promotion campaign. We all remember the sandshoe campaign which showed little children who now could have sandshoes because their mothers had got a family allowance supplement. Bus shelters had sandshoe adds all over them. If that was not political campaigning, nothing was. That was a case of taxpayers' money being used and abused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was even more blatant when it conducted the superannuation campaign in March 1990. This campaign cost $1.5m, yet in the Budget Papers there were no appropriations for it. When I asked the Department of Social Security in the Estimates committee whether it had planned to do this in February, the answer was no. When I asked whose decision it had been, twice Senator Bolkus said that it was the Government's. Because there was to be an election in March, it was the Government's decision in February to tell us about this super superannuation program, which has been a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government spent $1.5m on advertising itself. Yet Government members are here pontificating about how this is going to save the Australian public from corruption and save the Australian public from all the terrible things that are going to happen to it because the granny Government knows best how to save us and how to protect the Australian public, who are too stupid to work it out for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has reached the point where it cannot tell the difference and it cannot discriminate between justified information and politically motivated propaganda. This Bill would have provided an opportunity to set down those guidelines, but it has not. The Government has gone in the opposite direction. By strictly controlling all political advertising during election campaigns, this legislation gives the Government greater incentive to rely even more heavily on departmental advertising budgets. The Bill, as it is currently amended and as I understand it&mdash;and if I am not right, I would like the Minister to put me straight&mdash;will allow Government departments to continue advertising. Because there is no adviser here taking a note for the Minister I suppose I will not get any advice. I want to know whether this will allow government departments to continue advertising up to three months before the expiry date of the House of Representatives or when an election is called, whichever is the earlier?  Since 1970, only one Federal election has been called within three months of the expiry date of the House of Representatives. That was in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious how much this provision will benefit the incumbent government. An incumbent government, and only an incumbent government, knows when the election is going to be. Given the longstanding predisposition of Australian governments to call early elections, this gives the incumbent government the undue and unfair advantage of using departmental budgets to promote itself and its policies, without allowing the same leeway and the same information to the Opposition. The Government knows when there is going to be an election, so it steps up its departmental advertising, then calls the election and the Opposition cannot advertise, or it has limited advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget subliminal advertising. I want to ask a question of Australian Democrat senators&mdash;if any of them are awake in their rooms. They are not here in the chamber. There is not an Australian Democrat here. What is going to happen when Mrs Hawke participates in an advertisement for Greening Australia, or Austcare, or one of the other apolitical organisations that get money&mdash;in the case of Greening Australia, $759,000&mdash;from the Government? I am not denying Mrs Hawke her right to participate in an advertisement, but if the Government tells me and if the Australian Democrats come down here and tell me that that is not vicarious advertising for the Labor Party, then what is? Yet Mrs Hawke will be allowed to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are in government, of course Mrs Hewson will be able to participate, and I do not think she should be stopped either. But that vicarious advertising gives the government of the day, if the Prime Minister has any sort of profile, an unfair and undue advantage because that person can be seen as caring and doing things. We have not thought about that. The Australian Democrats might like to come down and explain to me whether they are going to stop Mrs Hawke or Mrs Hewson participating in those advertisements. That is another avenue for having one's party up on the screen participating and being involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other effects of the current proposal relates to electronic advertising during election campaigns. This will be restricted, as many of my colleagues have said, to candidates and political parties. At a time when there is virtually unprecedented public disenchantment with, and suspicion about, politicians this is a totally unsatisfactory compromise. Politicians are often accused of being out of touch with the electorate, yet this proposal means that, during an election campaign candidates, politicians and political parties&mdash;and no-one else&mdash;will be allowed to advertise in the electronic media. No-one with the expertise, no-one who can present another point of view&mdash;no-one&mdash;will be able to put his or her point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pressure groups will be prevented during an election from using the electronic media to convey their opinions on issues relating to that election campaign. This will mean that the only information that the general public will be able to receive through advertising in the electronic media during an election will be information conveyed by political parties. For quite obvious reasons, all that information is going to be politically biased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, in effect, will prevent the Australian public from having proper access to objective viewpoints, or at least apolitical or alternative viewpoints, during an election campaign. Heaven forbid, it may be just possible that, in relation to some areas of public policy and concern, some of these independent people may have views that are vitally important for the public to hear. But no, the Government and the Australian Democrats know better. They say that these people should not be allowed to put their points of view because doing so might lead to corruption. But do not worry about the dirty deals that are done with departments using their budgets for advertising government policies. Do not worry about vicarious advertising when a Prime Minister's wife gets on the screen with a sham organisation. It might be the sort of sham organisation that Senator O'Chee talked about. That is the sort of advertising we will get. That is the sort of bias we will get. This legislation is repugnant because it assumes that politicians have some sort of monopoly or mortgage on informed political comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe two other points need to be made in this debate. Restricting political advertising in the electronic media during election campaigns to a designated amount of free time advertising in a talking heads format makes a number of dangerous and, I think, unsubstantiated assumptions. It assumes that free time talking heads advertising is the best and the fairest way&mdash;in fact, the only way&mdash;for parties to inform the Australian public about their policies in the electronic media during an election campaign. I do not subscribe to such an untested assumption. There are arguments for and against all forms of advertising. However, I do not believe that any of these arguments are so overpowering that they should proscribe all forms of advertising in the electronic media bar one, as this Bill is attempting to do. It is prescribing exactly the form of advertising that is to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exclusive reliance on talking heads free time advertising also assumes that all political parties have equal opportunity before the election to sell their policies to the Australian public. As I have pointed out, this is not true when such vast resources are allocated to advertising campaigns conducted by government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Australian public should ever forget the sly and underhand way in which the Government, in particular Senator Bolkus, has attempted to push this advertising ban through this Parliament. When this legislation was first brought before the Parliament in June, it was obvious that there had been a complete lack of community consultation. The human rights people, journalists and advertisers themselves, as well as a wealth of community organisations, many of which were mentioned by Senator Reid&mdash;rural groups; the visually impaired, including the elderly, many of whom take a very active interest in politics but are denied the information; ethnic organisations; and people who have difficulty in reading&mdash;voiced their disgust. I went along to some of the private hearings. They voiced their disgust at this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Knowing it had the numbers, the Government pushed the legislation through the House of Representatives in June and, with its lack of desire for effective public consultation, it did it again later this month when it failed to support the Opposition's motion to send the legislation to a Senate committee. Again it denied the public the opportunity to debate it. Now the Government's true colours have been revealed yet again by the guillotining of this debate. It is not a guillotine like we have had before to rush 20 Bills through in two hours; it is a guillotine related to a particular time frame. The Opposition is quite happy to debate this Bill in February once the community has had time to express its views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the Family Law Bill coming into this chamber in 1987 at about this time. The Government said that the world was going to fall apart if we did not have the Family Law Bill; that everyone in the world would be divorced. But we said no, and the Australian Democrats agreed with us on that occasion because some sort of little deal had not been cooked up between them and the Government. We left it for the community to discuss. We came back here in February, there were four days, I think, of Senator Durack and Senator Tate debating backwards and forwards across the chamber and we got a Bill that was much better and less likely to have unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But not so now. We are going to rush this Bill through. What is different? There is no election on the horizon?  The difference is that the Government has a deal stitched up with the Australian Democrats and it is scared stiff that if the community gets to the Australian Democrats the Australian Democrats will change their mind as they normally do and the Government will not get this Bill. It will not get a restriction on the freedom and the rights of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians give away their rights. They have done it with Medicare; they have done it with the PBS data. And there is not much interest. But one day Australians will wake up and say, `It happened bit by bit. We let our freedoms go and we regret it now'. I suppose some of us will say, `We told you so'. Australians are complacent. Many of us have never had our freedoms denied, or knowingly had our freedoms denied. Those who have come from other countries know, but many Australians have just let it go. I think some Australians will suddenly wake up, maybe too late, in this debate. At least, unlike the Australian Democrats, we in the Opposition can say that we tried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the Australian public should understand that the disdain with which Minister Bolkus has treated them, they should not forget the sordid role the Australian Democrats have played in this legislation. The Democrats, while refusing to rule out whether they would support the Government's advertising ban, had the gall to take the high moral ground. They do it all the time. They regress to the high moral ground and say, `We are right. We are honourable. We are never wrong'. They claimed mischievously that it was they and not the coalition parties that were interested in ensuring the full disclosure of political donations. That is what they said. They always say, `We take the high moral ground. We were the ones who did it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the Democrats who, in a failed attempt to hold both the major parties to ransom, refused to split the disclosure and the advertising sections of the legislation, despite the fact that the Opposition had given a commitment to fair, non-coercive and equitable disclosure. It was the Democrats who refused to support Senator Parer's motion of 20 June to send the original Bill to a Senate committee, despite the fact that the Democrats themselves were proposing to make substantial amendments to it. If we denied them the right to send something off, there would be a song and dance throughout the community about what the coalition had done. Two months later, it was the Democrats who, in an attempt to prevent this legislation from dying its deserved natural death, embarked on a complete about-face and advocated that it be sent to a Senate select committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill that we debating tonight&mdash;or this morning, whichever one likes to call it&mdash;is all about freedom of speech, freedom of the media and the maintenance of democracy in Australia. Let us have a look at the history of this Government in this regard. I have been here a good while now, and this Government has introduced several Bills. It is determined that it will curtail the freedom of the citizens of this country, because it claims that it knows best.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what members of the Government have done. We had the Bill of Rights that they had a go at, supposedly legislating to give people in this country certain rights. We had the ID card&mdash;and we all remember the ID card; we all remember what they tried on that one. Now we have political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But first I want to talk about the Labor Party's particular brand of democracy. Members of the Labor Party divide into factions; they have faction leaders; they all decide, in their own factions, just what way they will vote; and then they make each person abide by that decision. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cook" NAMEID="RF4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure Senator Cook that we are not jealous of his brand of democracy. We like our brand of democracy, not the show and tell brand of democracy that he has. He has a vote in his party room for his leader and it is a sham&mdash;nothing more than a sham. We get all the indications from the various groups of how they are forced to vote certain ways because the unions tell them they will not get preselection if they do not. We know that Senator Cook's form of democracy is not a secret ballot; his Party uses the old-style union system of show and tell. If someone votes in a supposedly secret ballot, he then has to show his neighbour, to make sure he voted the right way. Wonderful democracy! We have had reports in the media of the union movement threatening certain members of Caucus that, if they do not vote the way they are told, they will lose preselection. Senator Cook should not try to tell me that that does not go on, because it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the various Bills the Government has tried to get through the Parliament. We have had the Law Council of Australia oppose each one. This is what the Law Council of Australia said, in a letter to us, about the proposed Bill of Rights:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)The Council's concern that the Australian Bill of Rights permits `reverse discrimination' in favour of disadvantaged races and groups. The Council points out that there is no support for this in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)The Council's concern at the wide range of powers given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner and of the secret nature of its investigations. The Council believes that secret investigations are objectionable especially where, as here, there is no right of legal or other representation before the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has the potential to be used as a lever to put pressure upon State Governments to change their laws. This is an aspect of the legislation which the Law Council believes has not been fully recognised in the debate to date. Of particular concern to the Law Council is the fact that before the Commission can investigate State laws, the consent of the responsible federal minister must be obtained. This provision clearly is open to abuse for political motives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)That the right to refuse to answer questions or provide information on the grounds of self-incrimination has been removed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is just one little thing the Government did&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">from persons who are summoned before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This seems to the Council to be the very antithesis of what should appear in a Bill of Rights.</PARA>
<PARA>The Council stated also:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the powers of the Commission in areas other than under the Sex Discrimination Act stop just short of final determination, the powers are themselves so wide-ranging, and the Commission may, in the exercise of them, so seriously affect the position of individual citizens, that the Law Council believes that the legislation in its present form cannot be supported.</PARA>
<PARA>In that debate, in February 1986, I gave a pretty good example of what could happen under this legislation. I would like to repeat that example tonight to remind my colleagues and remind honourable senators opposite of what the Labor Party tried to push through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the example of a Mrs Ann Citizen, who received in the mail&mdash;out of the blue&mdash;a letter from the Human Rights Commission saying that certain allegations had been made against her and directing her to come to the Commission's office to answer them. When she recovered from the shock, she rang the</PARA>
<PARA>Commission to find out what it was all about. She asked who had made the complaint. The Commission officer said that under section 29(2) the Commission had decided that she was not entitled to know who had made the complaint, as this was confidential. Ann Citizen said, `But that is not fair. I will arrange for my solicitor to accompany me to the office'. The Commission officer said, `Oh no, under section 34(4) of the Bill of Rights legislation you are not entitled to have legal representation unless we decide that you can. Just come by yourself. By the way, bring documents A and B which we understand you have in your possession. We understand there may also be certain letters. We believe those will help decide the issue'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ann Citizen, terrified at this stage, said, `They are private documents and private letters'. `But under section 35(2)(b)', says the Commission officer, `you will be fined or imprisoned if you don't provide the information that we demand even though it may be self-incriminatory'. Ann Citizen then said that she would appeal to the courts because she believed that she was not being shown true justice. Again the Commission officer said, `No, you don't. That's not possible either, because there is no appeal from the Commissioner's decision to a court of law'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the type of legislation that honourable senators opposite started with in 1986. That is the sort of legislation that they wanted to ram through this place in 1986, but the people rose up in wrath against them and they withdrew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the sorts of things they tried to legislate for. They tried to tell us that they would legislate so that we could have freedom from slavery in Australia. They said also that they would legislate to stop us from being tortured. This, in this country, was the legislation that in 1986 they tried to ram through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we came to the Australia Card. I am quite sure all the honourable senators on this side remember the public meetings, the marches in the streets and all of us addressing the people about the Australia Card. The Government wanted to introduce this Big Brother identification system so that a person had a number from birth to the grave&mdash;a number that related to one's medical history, all financial dealings, social security record, the state of one's immigration or otherwise, et cetera. What did the people do then? The people said no, and honourable senators opposite backed off on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the situation where we have this proposed ban on political advertising. The Senate set up a select committee on political broadcasting and advertising. I accepted Senator Kemp's advice to read some of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the evidence that was taken on the last day of sitting of that inquiry. I found that a Mr Sherry, who I gather was a university student, came before the Committee saying that he had decided to do a PhD on the strike by workers of the South East Queensland Electricity Board. He said that money was raised&mdash;by the ACTU, by the Trades and Labour Council, by all the union funds&mdash;for the families of union members on strike. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very laudable, says Senator Cook. Mr Sherry assured the Committee that leaflets were put out by the Queensland Trades and Labour Council saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sacked SEQEB Workers Distress Fund was set up to try and maintain the workers for the duration of the strike . . . The money is used to purchase food, which in turn is distributed to the families of the sacked workers . . . The fund is there solely for the sustenance of the sacked workers and their families.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of 15 February&mdash;all this happened in 1985&mdash;under a heading `Your Financial Support Needed', there was an advertisement put in by the Trades and Labour Council of Queensland. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trades and Labour Council has established a special fund to assist those trade unionists who have been dismissed and victimised by the decisions and actions of the Premier.</PARA>
<PARA>So money was raised. Mr Sherry told this Committee that there were indeed three funds&mdash;a total of over $3.5m raised. What he said was this: he went in to do his PhD because he was sympathetic to the strikers. The union said to him, `Here are the files. You can photostat anything you like. Do a good job'. And he did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This happens to be the evidence on the Bill&mdash;the evidence taken by the committee set up by the Senate to look at this Bill. So it is quite relevant, I would say.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Sherry found when he went through the documents was as follows, to quote again from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The material I have uncovered during the course of the book on the SEQEB indicates that, while the SEQEB strike funds were collected for the sacked workers and their families, a great deal of the money that was collected simply did not reach the striking families. On many occasions, the money was wasted. More significantly, on other occasions, it was decided that the money would be used for purposes not directly associated with the SEQEB dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most obvious example of this was when $40,000 from SEQEB strike funds was donated by the Trades and Labour Council of Queensland and the ACTU to assist the ALP in the by-election for the seat of Redlands.</PARA>
<PARA>What a disgrace! How on earth do we overcome this in the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill? How on earth do we overcome that sort of abuse by the Labor Party that is so continual, and that we reach so many times? Bob Hogg has been convicted of an offence; no Liberals have been convicted of an offence. Senator Loosley is being queried; no Liberals are being queried. When it is so deliberate and so underhand, how can this sort of abuse be stopped? How can it be stopped by the legislation that the Government has before the Senate tonight? I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not just that sort of abuse. We have been watching what has been happening in Western Australia. We have been watching Brian Burke and his stamps. The whole country has been watching the abuse by the Labor Party. With the sort of political abuse that I have just quoted from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, and with abuse by Bob Hogg, Senator Loosley and Brian Burke and all the shenanigans that went on in Western Australia, how can the Government senators have the hypocrisy to bring up the disclosure of political donations?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw, Madam Acting Deputy President. I want to stick to this Bill because it is very important to Australia. At a time when all other nations are moving towards freedom of speech and communism is being defeated all over the world, Australia is moving the other way. We have 20 or 30 hours, or whatever the time is, to debate this Bill. Certainly it is sufficient to give everyone time to state their position. But what infuriates me and worries me is that that is not giving the community groups that are affected by this Bill time to have any input to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a week ago the report of the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures was brought down in the Senate and only yesterday 37 amendments to the Bill were proposed. There were 14 more added today. So 51 amendments have been put before the Senate in the last 24 to 36 hours and the Government has not let any community debate take place on them. I can understand that because, if community debate were allowed to take place, it would build up a head of steam in two or three months and then the Government would have to withdraw the legislation, as it did the Bill of Rights, and it would have to go the other way. That is why we are seeing tonight a debate that is going to take this number of hours to get it through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not really matter what the Government does because, when a government is finished, it will never deceive the people. The people have made up their minds. In effect, this Bill applies to the television stations a bill of $18m. Three of the networks are in financial trouble&mdash;Channel 9, Channel 0 and Channel 7&mdash;although Channel 9 is trading reasonably profitably. This Government then says to those people who are struggling for existence that it is going to saddle them with another $18m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disgraceful Bill. In effect, it will not be the television stations that will pay. These costs must get passed on. There is nothing free in this world. Everything has a cost and every cost must be passed on. We are going to see the people who place advertisements with these commercial television stations picking up the Government tab. That is completely unfair and I do not see how anyone who supports justice, particularly Senate Tate as Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, can put his name to such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problems come when we look at the terms of the Bill. The Bill covers not only the Federal Government, but local government and State government also. The Bill gives any government 40 per cent of the free time. It gives the Opposition 40 per cent of the free time. It gives the Democrats 10 per cent, and it gives independents 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give a couple of examples. I do not know what would happen in these circumstances. Let us take the National Party in Western Australia, which is not in coalition with the Liberal Party there. How are those funds to be distributed there? What does the National Party get out of that 40 per cent? Does it get a percentage of the 40 per cent or does it get a percentage of the 10 per cent?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kemp" NAMEID="WW4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We could turn that around in Queensland, where the Liberal Party and the National Party are not in coalition. Where does that leave democracy? Where does that leave the two fairly significant parties in the State Houses? Do they get a proportion of the Opposition's share or do they get the 10 per cent? Senator Tate might be able to inform us about that in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens to Independents such as Senator Harradine and Senator Vallentine if this legislation goes through? It will do so with the support of the Australian Democrats, so what happens to those people? They do not get any sorts of guarantees that they would get a percentage. If 20 Independents stand in Tasmania, Senator Harradine would not get any help at all, yet he is a sitting senator and so is Senator Vallentine. Those people are going to be completely neglected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this Bill does, of course, is entrench the larger parties; it does not provide any opportunity for people who may have some political ability and something to sell in the political forum to gain entry to parliament. So that stymies democracy also. No-one has the chance to get his message across to the public and therefore no different ideas can come forward. I dare say that if the Democrats were to launch their party now, they would not have the opportunity to establish a party that would be represented in this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of suggestions tonight that the Democrats have been led up the garden path. I just wonder who is leading whom up the garden path. We have seen tonight that the Democrats come out of this with free advertising time worth about $1.8m. That is a very significant increase on what they have been able to raise through their fundraising in the past. So the Democrats have come out of this very well, but the rest of democracy has suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fewer people are buying newspapers and more people are relying on radio and television for their information. That applies particularly to rural people who are unable to obtain their daily newspaper or their weekly newspaper. They rely entirely on information from the radio and television stations. These rural Australians&mdash;or new Australians who have difficulty in reading newspapers&mdash;will be discriminated against. This Bill does not take into consideration any of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 18 minutes a day or 500 minutes over the 28 days of the election campaign is going to be distributed in two-minute grabs with people giving a direct message. I wonder whether politicians giving a message for two minutes will be interesting enough for people to sit and watch. I think it will be a giant turn-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly worried about the ability of political parties to get a message across. It is not uncommon in Australia for various newspapers and media outlets to have a bias towards one political party or the other. I see this legislation making the political commentators very much stronger. Their views will carry much more weight and there will be no opportunity for political parties to answer those criticisms, balance their arguments and get their political message across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is fraught with all these inconsistencies that go against the very basis of what we hold so dear in Australia&mdash;the ability to project and enunciate our political positions. It should be the right of every person in Australia to be able to say, `This is what we are all about. This is what we believe in and this is the message that we want to give to you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite worried about this Bill. It is one of the worst pieces of legislation that I have ever had to speak on. In normal circumstances I would not get into a debate at 3.30 in the morning, but I am so concerned about this legislation and the effect that it is going to have on Australia that I have done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The added power that radio and television commentators are going to have is going to be so significant in Australia that it will be hard to get a balance of the arguments. I do not believe that putting almost total power into the hands of political commentators is democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot more money will be spent on advertising&mdash;on newspaper advertisements and, of course, all sorts of direct mailing campaigns and telemarketing&mdash;so I do not believe we are going save that much money. The money collected will be diverted into other types of advertising. It is a political fact that when a government is unpopular&mdash;this happens to governments of all persuasions&mdash;there will be a rush to support the alternative government. That alternative government will collect money because people want a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what is happening at the moment. This Government has governed for eight years and no-one could say it has governed wisely. It has sown an absolute depression. I suppose that the image that it is frightened to have on television is that of one million unemployed people. I know the types of advertisements that would be run and I know that the Government is fearful that it would never be able to answer them. Just the other day we saw 3,000 people lining up at the Toyota factory for only 70 jobs. The other day 1,500 people turned up for jobs at a nightclub. Those are the images that this Government is frightened that we will project, so it is running for cover. But while it is running for cover it is almost destroying what Australians have enjoyed, that is, the right of free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, rural Australia has been neglected because it will not be able to get the information that it requires to make an informed choice. It will not be able to get it from radio or television. It will not be able to get it from newspapers, because they are not available in the bush. It is a day of infamy; it is a day on which the Government has run scared. If it had not run scared, it would have let debate go on in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hundred and twenty-seven people made submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, the report of which was brought down only a couple of days ago. Those people would want to see the report, they would want to see the Bill, they would want to see the amendments&mdash;and no-one has seen anything. The Government has decided to suffer the pain now, to get the Bill through before Christmas when people's minds are not on legislation or on government, to get it over, to rush it through the House and give everyone here the chance to speak on it but not to give people in the community the right to have a look at it so that they can then come back to their elected representatives and make the points they want them to raise in the Parliament of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate tonight has been a bit of a cop-out. The Liberal and National parties certainly do not have the numbers to defeat the Bill. The Democrats will gain $1.8m, the Government will secure the passage of the Bill and the people of Australia will lose their right to free speech. As I said, today is a day of infamy. What we will have lost when the vote is taken is the very basic right of Australians to say what they want to say and to have their message reach the people. That is going to be lost today when the Government and the Democrats vote for this Bill and deny Australians something that they have had since this country was founded 200 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very unhappy to be in this chamber when such a Bill is being passed. I feel powerless because I cannot do more about it. The decision relies on the numbers in this Parliament. Obviously, we can fight and we can move amendments, but the ultimate decision depends on the numbers. The Democrats have made their decision. They will get their money. The Government will get its Bill, which it thinks will save it at the next election. I can tell honourable senators opposite honestly, because I have been around politics when we have been winners and losers, that once they are out, they are out. Once the tide goes out, there is nothing they can do. They cannot swim against it. It runs faster and faster as the water recedes and there is no way out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have had eight years of Labor Party government and they have made their decision now. If the Government brings in this legislation it will stop freedom of speech and stop the Opposition pointing out all the indiscretions, bad decisions and hardships that it has put people through. People do not need to see 30-second television advertisements to know what the Government has done. They know it. They feel it in their pockets. They feel it when their kids cannot get a job. They feel it when they are getting thrown out of their houses because they cannot meet their mortgages. They know it when they cannot make the repayments on their farms. So it does not really matter whether the Bill is going to save the Government's bacon. It will not save its bacon. The Government has gone. It is finished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter when the Government calls an election. What does matter fundamentally is that, in its desperation to hold government, it has betrayed the Australian people and taken away from them what is very basic to them, something that they have had for 200 years. Honourable senators opposite ought to be ashamed, particularly Senator Tate, because he is a man who has credibility and a man who would not normally put his name to this type of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it very sad to have the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill put in front of us at such short notice for a full and proper debate. The Government is obviously running scared. Today&mdash;I was going to say `tonight', but it is no longer tonight; it is now `this morning'&mdash;in the Senate we are seeing the fruits of a typical dirty deal between the Hawke Labor Government and the Australian Democrats to force through a measure of political censorship which Australians do not want but which, of course, serves to advantage both of those political parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it interesting that the Government has done this at such a time. It is not even two weeks since Dr John Hewson released the Fightback package, a program for taxation reform, a program for reform that the Government has not been able to lay a glove on. It has not even been able to get near it. Certain Ministers in their attempts to do so have been described as the Laurel and Hardy of Australian politics. The Howes and the Kerins of this world have been trying to refute what the Liberal and National parties have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, that whole program has frightened the living daylights out of the Government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has now seen fit to gag the Liberal and National parties to make sure that they do not have freedom of speech in the period coming up to the next election. I have yet to figure out what the urgency is, but quite clearly the Government has something in mind. Maybe it wants to go to the polls early or maybe, if Mr Keating decides to challenge Mr Hawke again, it will find a slight glimmer of hope that will enable it then to rush off to the polls. But the Government wants to make sure, no matter which way it goes, that we are gagged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Australian Democrats want to make sure of the same, and they will do that purely and simply because they do not want to be forced into a position of trying to argue against the Fightback package. In their gormless, idiotic, weak-kneed, lily-livered attempts over the last week and a half to denigrate the Fightback package, the Australian Democrats came second only to the Government. Yet their brilliant so-called leader, Senator Coulter, has come out today and made the absolutely inane comment that we should be making sure that food, clothing and footwear are exempt from the GST. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good question, but Senator Coulter does not understand the difference. He does not understand what a tariff is, he does not understand what the GST is, he does not understand the relevancy of exemption from a GST, he does not understand what the wholesale sales tax system is. So the easiest way for the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party to go and hide under a rock is to make sure that they do not have to argue this package in the period leading up to an election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties have maintained a very firm stance of principle on this issue right from the word go. We want full and fair disclosure, but what we do not want is censorship. That is a totally different ideal or objective from that of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. I am completely opposed even to the compromise legislation of a Minister in a supposedly democratic country, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who has stated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action must be taken now to sanitise the electoral system.</PARA>
<PARA>Why on earth would he say that if he did not think the Government was looking down the barrel of certain defeat? The Government does not want a full and proper debate on policy at the next election because it has no policies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, or yesterday now, Senator West stood in this chamber and said that we lack compassion. Is that not absolutely hilarious, coming from a member of a Government that has made sure that over one million people are unemployed? She does not want that debated in the public arena, come the next election. She wants censorship, she wants to make sure that there is not free and open discussion of issues and policies, because she knows that her party has no policies, no vision, no future and no options; it has only more of the same. It is saying,`We will give you more of the same. We will not be happy until we have two million people unemployed'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political parties, in the view of the coalition, are voluntary institutions with the consequent right to communicate directly with the electorate through whatever forms of advertising are most effective. In putting forward this shabby little deal, this Hawke Labor Government has ignored the mass of evidence that came before the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures. The report of that Committee was an absolute masterpiece of selectivity and evasion. I do not think that Government senators have actually read the report. They do not really care what is in it because they had made up their minds that they were going to gag freedom of speech in this country once and for all.

People can then actually hear you and see you and they can then come up and question you in more detail about what your policies actually are. That is a much more effective and personable way to do it than this glitzy razzamatazz that people seem to think is the appropriate way to go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot said about free speech. Under our current system the only way that people can have their `free speech' for any product that they wish to advertise on the media is to buy it. It is not free. There are also restrictions upon what one can say, which undermines the suggestion that it is free. The material is put to air by putting up money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been decided in other places that money is the root of all evil. From discussions in this chamber tonight, honourable senators have heard of the problems faced where the need to provide money for political advertising has become the source of allegations of corruption. Senators have certainly heard of the problems overseas, for instance in Japan, where there have been a number of scandals and people actually admitting that they have to buy their election campaigns. Tonight Senator Kernot dealt with the situation in the United States of America. Senator Kernot and I both had a trip in 1986 to observe the mid-term elections in the USA. We went to Missouri to observe the senatorial race. However, we were unable to meet the Democrat candidate because she was on the west coast actually having to raise money. In 1986 something like $10m was spent in pandering to the need for glitzy television and radio advertisements, when in fact the money would have been better spent by the candidates getting out and meeting the people. That also would remove the taint of corruption. The stories of the PACs over there are legendary. It is important that honourable senators bear these sorts of things in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the discussion in this place tonight, senators have been saying that this legislation is going to produce a one-party state in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also look at Canada, which does not have paid political advertising. In France the political parties receive free time for advertising on state radio and television. In Denmark, Austria and Israel political advertising is prohibited at election time. I could go on. Anyone would think that what we are planning tonight is the end of Western civilisation as we know it. Yet those countries I have just mentioned are not anarchist states; they are not totalitarian states; they are democracies. They are countries where democratic principles are upheld very strongly. It is an absolute furphy to say that the passing of this Bill will be the end of Western civilisation as we know it, or the end of the democratic process. </PARA>

After all, it does seem to have built up close friendships among the owners of some of the electronic media.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already seen some evidence, at a Western Australian State election, of how a media proprietor can be approached by the Prime Minister in order to make available material for Mr Burke, the Premier of Western Australia, to use in an election advertisement. If there is the capacity for that kind of influence, it is a serious threat to the political process that that sort of power will now be centred in the hands of media owners, at least one of whom may happen to be a mate of the Prime Minister.

Most do not get their views from newspapers. It is actually 8 1/2 per cent of 18- and 19-year-olds and it goes up the scale to 25, slowly increasing as people become more mature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of that is that something like 90 per cent of young Australians would be depending on the electronic media for their information. The electronic media is exactly the source of information that this Government is going to censor through this legislation, in the sense that advertising material relating to elections will no longer be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, this vital and large group of Australians&mdash;the under-25s&mdash;will suffer particularly from a lack of information as a result of this Government's legislation, because this is the group that does not depend on newspapers for information. Yet the newspapers will be the only source of political information via advertising that will be allowed. This Bill is especially discriminatory against the young people of Australia in, basically, denying them access through the media with which they are most comfortable&mdash;particularly, radio and television&mdash;by denying those media the right to have political advertising. That group will then be denied access to information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the Labor Party thinks it is a great idea that it should deny young Australians access to information, because about two-thirds of that age group vote for the Labor Party. In other words, the less one knows and the less access one has to newspapers, the more likely one is to vote Labor. That is what the figures indicate clearly. So it is in the Labor Party's vested interests not to allow information of a political nature&mdash;political advertising&mdash;to be made available to this group of young Australians who rely on radio and television for their information. If this is as well thought out as I think it must be, this legislation appears to be part of a determined and deliberate pattern to try to keep these people uninformed and therefore still voting Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have two potential reasons for the Government proceeding with this. Firstly, it would suit the Government to have its friendly media gurus as the influences at election time, without their influence being capable of being matched by advertising. Secondly, the Government wishes to keep information from members of this vital group which tends to vote heavily its way, and who may well take a different view if they have access to information. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deal with the Democrats is the third leg of this disgraceful and dishonourable device aimed at keeping a discredited Labor Government in power. We have seen the first two legs; the third is the deal with the Democrats. We know, because Senator Kemp outlined it and Senator Kernot was incapable of denying it, that under this scheme the Democrats will get a massive increase in the amount of time on television by way of free time than they could afford in paid time at the 1990 election&mdash;in other words, 50 hours of free time during a normal election campaign, when last time they could not afford to buy 50 hours of time. So here are the Australian Democrats getting a clear, distinct and unequivocal advantage which is worth a substantial amount of money; something like $1.8m, I think, was Senator Kemp's figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear element of self-interest in the Democrats agreeing to do this deal with the Labor Party, but why would the Labor Party do it? The answer is simple. The Labor Party would do it because it gets something like two-thirds of the Democrats' preferences, now that the Democrats have clearly identified themselves as the left wing of the Labor Party and are, in many instances, happily prepared to direct their preferences to the Labor Party, rather than do what they did when they were genuinely the Democrats when they used to put out two-sided how-to-vote tickets&mdash;on one side, how to provide one's preference to the Labor Party; on the other side, how to provide one's preference to the Liberal Party. So there is a clear and dishonourable deal based, ultimately, on bringing an electoral benefit to the Labor Party, paid for either by the public or by the media industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kernot said, there is no substance in a 30-second grab&mdash;she meant, of course, `ad', but she said `grab'&mdash;and strangely, by accident, Senator Kernot was right.

There is no doubt that under this legislation a 30-second grab or a 15-second grab in the news, apart from the guru commentators who will be given free rein, is going to be the way in which political messages are got across. That is the very thing that Senator Kernot says is insubstantial and is not what the Australian Democrats believe is the best way to present a point of view. She goes on to say that the 30-second grab&mdash;and I presume she meant to say the 30-second ad&mdash;does not provide an adequate point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that at least the 30-second ad does provide what the political parties want to get across, and that can be offset by what the other political party wants to say in reply. In other words, there is a freedom of speech involved in allowing responses. It is noticeable that the 30-second grab in a news item is not capable of being responded to, under this Government's dishonourable legislation, on electronic media. There is no capacity to reply, but that suits this Government because it does not want the capacity to reply. I suppose that when those opposite are so much on the back foot because they have made such a mess of things, the one thing they must do is ensure that the people with a case to put are denied the opportunity to put it. The Australian Democrats have quite happily gone along with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the vote of the Australian Democrats on this legislation, which has been bought with this offer of a huge increase in the amount of television time which they will get for nothing but which they could not afford before, may well be purchased with counterfeit money if the courts deny the whole question of free time on television&mdash;which they may well do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of whether the Australian Democrats, who are playing such a key role in this matter, are not only doing it out of crass self-interest but also have, in this self-interest and in this disgusting deal with the Labor Party, totally sold out the party that they belong to, and certainly sold out the principles on which that party was built. Senator Knowles mentioned in passing that former Senator Macklin in May 1990&mdash;only last year&mdash;stressed the importance of advertising in the political and democratic process. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I made the comment when this issue was first debated in this place that `A democracy relies on two things: The first is the ability of people to have a free vote and express their free determined will as to who shall govern them in the next parliament, and the second, which is equally important and on which democracy stands, is information. Without information a democracy is dead'.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats are voting on this legislation to destroy access to information. The Australian Democrats are doing so without a conscience because of massive self-interest and because of the deal they have chosen to do with the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give honourable senators a further view of the basic principles the Australian Democrats are now abandoning, ex-Senator Mason, who I think was the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats in the 1980s&mdash;and this is in striking contrast with the attitudes of the people who now, as I said earlier, have effectively become the left-wing rabble of the Labor Party&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are in favour of political advertising. We would like nothing more in this country than to see in the newspapers and the media balanced and reasonable advertisements which lay out the policies of political parties and their intentions for the future so that the electors can read them and know before they vote that their content is true.</PARA>
<PARA>He was making the case that there should be requirements for honesty in advertising. I must say, having looked at some advertising in recent years from this Government in particular, that there is no doubt some merit in the general proposition that there is a requirement for truth in advertising applying to politics as it applies to everything else. The question of how it is implemented is another matter altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the basic point that Senator Mason made: the Democrats are in favour of political advertising. And Senator Macklin made the point that, without information, a democracy is dead. The Australian Democrats are doing their best to kill it off in this chamber. I have received a fax from a group from the Australian Capital Territory which calls itself the Social Conscience Group `Putting people before politics'. This fax was sent to all Democrat senators. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following telephone discussions with forty-five members of the Australian Democrats, the following statement has been agreed upon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We view with grave concern the fact that Democrat Senators plan to join with the Labor Party in pushing through the Senate a ban on political advertising on radio and television. We see such a ban as being steeped in hypocrisy and contempt. It will serve to alienate many supporters of the Australian Democrats who have links with a wide range of interest groups and companies who, for reasons we support, would forbid freedom of speech. We see nothing in anything put forward by our Senators to change our thinking on this matter. Should our Senators support this ban we in turn will immediately resign our membership of the Australian Democrats and will target those Senators in a forthcoming election as not being men and women of conviction.'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the question of the discriminatory behaviour of the Government in denying young people access in the electronic media to political information with which they have a connection. The same is true of the 20 per cent of Australian women who are in the work force as well as having to fulfil what have been described as home duties. Those women are in the work force because of the pressures imposed on families, particularly by this Government, to have two income earners simply to meet their basic financial requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This 20 per cent of the voting population, women in households who also work, do not have time to watch the TV news. According to the surveys, they do not watch the TV news and certainly do not have time to read newspapers, except for the advertisements of the specials on sale in order to assist in stretching out their housekeeping money. Some of them tape soapies and watch them while they are doing things like the ironing. One of the reasons why they do not watch the news is that, quite frankly, they do not want to be further depressed by whatever the news happens to be and they get relaxation by watching soapies. They do not have time, of course, to listen to the radio. In other words, under this ad ban this group too will be denied access to any information of an electoral nature at election time, because television is the only medium that they have time to listen to or to watch when they are doing other tasks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more Australians have switched back to listening to radio. Often it provides companionship to the very large proportion&mdash;40 per cent or so&mdash;of Australians who are not in families. What is interesting is that radio is the cheapest form of advertising. I know that from the time when I was the member for Macarthur. In a rural area, in particular, radio is the method of access, and it is becoming more so in the cities. To pretend that radio advertising, because of its alleged expense, will lead to corruption is one of the most ludicrous, self-seeking bits of nonsense that this Government has come up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply false, but the Democrats are quite happy to proceed with something that is self-evidently false because of the self-interest involved in their agreeing to get paid off in free time for backing this Government. I do not know what the Democrats intend to do in the committee stage with respect to our proposed amendment to exempt radio from this, and I do not know whether senators from remote areas, like the Minister in the chamber, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), feel content that their vote is going to deprive the residents of places like the Northern Territory of the right to hear argument and hear a case by way of radio advertising in remote areas. The Minister may feel content with that. Maybe he has a vested interest in a lack of information. In view of his performance, I suppose it would be just as well if the constituents in the Northern Territory were deprived of the capacity for him to put out advertisements protesting his innocence or his purity, because no-one would believe them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that radio is a method of communication which is so cheap, relative to other methods of advertising, that to pretend that it should be excluded on the basis that its cost is so horrendous that it will lead to corruption is dishonest and disgraceful. But, of course, that is what this Bill is&mdash;it is dishonest and disgraceful. There is no urgency about it and yet we are being gagged. The next election is not due until 1993, yet the legislation has been declared urgent and is being rushed through this place. That is why this protest is going on from the Opposition. It is a protest against dishonesty. It is a protest against an assault on democracy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report released last week was of much interest to me as a person who has been involved in campaigning for many years.

Surely the Opposition can see that this Bill will make elections a fairer contest, as people will be far more able to judge candidates on their merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current political advertising that is paid for by parties is often a reflection of what politics should not be about. The advertisements are sometimes extravagant, almost always expensive and at times unrelated to the real issues. I am not denying that over the years there have been some excellent television advertisements. After all, who can forget the most effective political ad of all, `It's Time'? In fact, the Australian Labor Party has been responsible for the best television advertisements. In many respects we have more to lose than the Opposition, because we do the best marketing. </PARA>

We understand that there are problems within the system that need to be addressed. The status quo will not do. One main problem is that, as costs spiral, more and more resources have to be pumped into campaigns. Smaller parties and independents are left totally out in the cold.

Currently the creations at election time are viewed more as works of art than as an important political contribution to the nation. It is worth examining the way in which politicians communicated before television provided them with large captive audiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill in many ways offers a little of the old-fashioned methods of campaigning. By this I mean that in the future elections will focus more on the work of individual candidates than on the advertising agency which has the contract. The future of political advertising is assured through this Bill. Despite the claims of the Opposition to the contrary, the look of advertisements may change but the human touch is revived through the restrictions on the type of advertising that is allowed to be broadcast. I know many senators will join with me in my calls to see political advertising toned down for the sake of our political profession, as well as for financial and equity reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition point out that they see this as a question of fundamental civil and human rights. Once again the evils of state intervention are paraded around through the use of Liberal rhetoric. Before we know it, they will be pointing fingers at us and calling us socialists. Perhaps the Opposition will even revive the `reds under the beds' story before this debate is through. The people of Australia have far more to fear from the present political advertising situation than they could ever have from the implications of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the population must realise is that elections are no longer a chance for people to choose; rather, they are an exhibition of advertising ability and a competition based purely upon finances. People can also be exploited by advertising of the nature that has occurred in elections. Citizens want factual information of the kind that this Bill provides for. How dare the Opposition deny the Australian people what they really want to see&mdash;a decent realistic attempt to communicate policy in a fair political environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I often wonder whether the Opposition understands the way that we ordinary Australians think. We do not believe that the wealthy should be automatically entitled to a head start in anything. Opposition senators are saying that freedom of speech is restricted by government regulation aimed at making things fairer. They just do not believe in fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition carries on as though this Bill is going to strip away every one of our fundamental rights and civil liberties. If this Bill, which seeks to restrict the nature and quantity of quality advertisements, is undemocratic, why have so many other liberal democracies banned or placed restrictions upon paid political advertising? I will tell the Senate why: it is the sensible thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the United Kingdom has restricted political advertisements, and the Opposition's parent party, the Conservative Party, has been in government there for over 10 years. Has it dismantled it? No. It has dismantled everything else worth while, just as Dr Hewson would if he were in government, but it has kept the restrictions to party political broadcasts. The UK has a very strict set of regulations, which include restrictions upon the amount of broadcasting time that a particular party can be given. News and current affairs programs are also the subject of scrutiny, and self-regulation by the networks is required to ensure that no particular party is biased. We are not aiming to go as far as that, although such restrictions certainly have merit. Rather, we simply want political broadcasts to be the subject of intense scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 this Government attempted to change the Constitution to establish some fundamental rights that we believed should be laid down in law&mdash;enshrined in our Constitution for the benefit of future generations of Australians. The Opposition, being the great upholder of civil liberties and human rights that it is, opposed every proposal that we put up. If this Opposition really believed in rights, it would not have opposed those proposals. It is my opinion that the Opposition is trying to look after itself and its mates because it knows that money is no problem for it, particularly when some interest group or business is only too happy to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broadcasting stations should also be only too happy to assist the community by showing these advertisements for free. I would have thought that maintaining a fair society and a vibrant democracy would be a priority for Australia's broadcasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political funds disclosure aspect of this Bill is very important also, as we believe that the Australian people should have access to such information. The necessity for third parties or organisations other than political parties to disclose funding is also important, as these organisations clearly play an important part in the political process. With the Australian Electoral Commission overseeing the disclosure of funding information, the public can also be assured of independence and fairness in the implementation of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that it is the responsibility of all parties in this country to support the disclosure of funding information. It saddens me that Dr Hewson's initial willingness to support disclosure has been weakened by pressure from the Liberal Party machine and administration. The Opposition has attacked what I believe is an important Bill which addresses many of the concerns of many people and groups in society. It offers the populace the opportunity to see political parties lay their cards on the table, and it calls on candidates to work harder to prove themselves worthy rather than relying so heavily upon the central campaign. It calls on the political actors to prove themselves within the political system, and to do so on equal ground. It is a positive attempt to show the people of this country what we will do to represent them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not try to be brief tonight; there are a number of issues which, surprisingly, have not been covered by the many speakers in this second reading debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. One of the issues of particular concern to me&mdash;one that has not been raised in debate thus far&mdash;is what this Bill does in relation to the Commonwealth using its power over broadcasting, I presume, to impose its will on the States in relation to the conduct of elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that people such as Senator Schacht, whom we have not seen in here for a few hours, have very little respect for State boundaries. I think it is fair to say that airwaves and radio waves also have very little respect for State boundaries, but the issue at stake is whether a State and sovereign State governments can be the masters of their own political systems. No matter what anyone can say about the conduct of elections in the States, about the electoral boundaries drawn by some State governments and their electoral commissioners from time to time, the point at issue is whether a government&mdash;one located, in the case of Western Australia, some 3,000 kilometres away from Perth&mdash;can be allowed to control the electoral system of a sovereign State parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate, as the States House, that this legislation is perhaps the greatest attack on a State parliament's rights to determine its own electoral system. It is a travesty of States rights for a Commonwealth Government and for this Parliament to be imposing restrictions on the right of any political party in a State to advertise policies and political platforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an example of this Government's total disregard for the Federation, which is nearly 100 years old. It is a total disregard of the stated objective of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, of trying to find a new federal compact, of trying to reform Federal-State relations. It makes a mockery of Mr Hawke's stated objective of trying to reform the Federation and, indeed, of his use of the term `new federalism'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the advantages of a federal system, long stated by both the founding fathers of the United States and the founding fathers of Australia, is that where there are sovereign State parliaments and a Commonwealth parliament, both with a separation of powers, there can be a degree of experimentation when it comes to public policy. If there is a unified system and a mistake in public policy is made, that mistake comes to visit every citizen throughout the entire nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most honourable senators would argue&mdash;some of us from this side would argue differently from those on the Government benches&mdash;that there have been mistakes in relation to the conduct of elections in some States. But the fact is that, through electoral reform, in various States there has been progress and reform. Even though that electoral reform may lag behind in another State, the fact is that there is experimentation and there is progress with electoral reform. With this sweeping overriding of States' rights in relation to the conduct of their own elections, that experimentation cannot continue. The Commonwealth will determine for all time how the use of the electronic media is to be determined and limited within the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who is committed to ensuring that significant powers and rights are retained by the States, this offends me. One of the amendments that the Opposition will be moving during the committee stage is for the removal of any reference in this legislation to State and Territory governments. I suggest to the Government and also to the Democrats: if we do need to take on such a radical experiment in the limitation of the use of the electronic media, if we are really forced to do that because the Democrats will not yield to the Opposition's profound and succinct arguments tonight in relation to this limitation of political freedom, let us maintain that experiment at the Commonwealth level. Let us restrict it to Federal elections. Let us not see this strange, radical experiment in limiting the use of the electronic media imposed upon the States. Indeed, I am prepared to say that, if it is a success at the Federal level, let the States copy it. But let those State governments and State parliaments decide whether or not they too want to impose an electronic media ban. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aspects of this legislation is the proposal that political advertising cannot take place during the period of a State election. One of the motivations for the Government introducing this Bill at this time and trying to rush it through the Federal Parliament was pointed out yesterday and today by a number of my colleagues. Although I would admit that, bearing in mind the pace of this debate at this hour of the morning, it does not feel as if the Bill is being rushed through the Senate, it is being rushed through in terms of its consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at when State and Territory elections are to be held over the next three or four years, we will see that there is an incredible motivation for the ALP machine to impose a ban on electronic media advertising. Labor has a government in Victoria that is on its last legs. The government in the Australian Capital Territory is in a mess. A government in Queensland is facing an election in 1993. A government in South Australia is, again, in political turmoil and is a political basket case. In my home State of Western Australia, another political basket case is facing an election prior to May 1993. Honourable senators from Tasmania would be interested to know that they have an election due before 29 May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in the next year and a half, Australia will have at least six State and Territory elections. If this legislation is passed, political parties in each of those States and the Territory will not be allowed to advertise during the election period. That would suit the Labor Party because in virtually all of those States the Labor incumbents are on the nose and the polls are down. Most of them have had or have corruption commissions. The Labor Party would not want to see community organisations or other political parties that oppose those governments putting forward their views during an election campaign because that would act to the detriment of those incumbent governments. Of course, that is a restriction on democratic rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more important matter as far as Federal politics go is that Federal political parties will be restricted in terms of advertising during those periods. In the next 18 months, as I have already said, six State and Territory elections are due. There will be a period of at least six months out of those 18 months when Federal political parties will not be allowed to advertise. Of course, that suits this tired, old, worn-out Federal Government led by a tired, old, worn-out Prime Minister. If one takes out a couple of Christmas holidays, when political advertising is not generally conducted, one finds that the number of months in which any Federal political party can conduct a significant electronic media campaign to sell, for example, a Fightback policy will be enormously restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a federation like Australia there is always going to be an election somewhere around the country. The long term consequence of this legislation is that the right for a Federal political party to advertise will be severely curtailed. To that extent, political freedoms and freedom of speech will be curtailed, no matter how much honourable senators opposite protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a restriction on the rights of organisations which are not exempt. That was referred to yesterday by my colleague, Senator Olsen. There is an exemption for certain charitable organisations and community organisations. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>During election campaigns a number of those organisations can put onto the electronic media messages that do not explicitly or implicitly have a political message or that ask people to vote in a particular way. However, one does not need to have made much of a study of political advertising to understand that it is quite possible and quite normal for these sorts of organisations, and indeed political organisations, to put on advertisements that do not have a very explicit political message but that still get the message across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservation groups or welfare groups may place on television advertisements that would not contravene this draconian Bill. But the rights of other organisations will be restricted. I refer specifically to industry organisations, professional associations and other groups, particularly groups that represent the interests of the private sector and private enterprise, which even this Government recognises need to expand and create profits to generate the sorts of jobs we need to overcome the terrible malaise that his nation faces at the moment. The legislation restricts those organisations from putting their views, whether those views are considered to be political or not. Messages from groups such as the Automobile Association and the Chamber of Mines, which might advocate the sense of allowing greater access to land for exploration or taxation changes to encourage exploration and mining, will be banned under this legislation whereas the views of organisations that may oppose the views of the private enterprise sector will be allowed. So it is quite biased against industry and against the private sector. That, too, would favour a socialist, anti-development, anti-business government such as the one we have federally and such as the ones we have in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter to which many Government senators refer is comparisons with other nations.

But it is important to note that, in the report on the Bill prepared by the committee of which Senator Kemp and Senator Olsen were members, a rough break-up of expenditure on political campaigns for the last Federal election showed that the Democrats spent approximately (1)/(32) of all moneys spent. The result of the Bill, of course, is that they will be able to spend about 10 per cent of all of the free time on advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp has already brought into this chamber some figures specifically relating to the impact of the Democrats' amount of free time on the electronic media. I do not intend to go over those.

I say to the Democrats that when it comes to the issue of political self-interest&mdash;and I do not mean this in a demeaning way at all&mdash;they really would have to be mad to knock back the deal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good motivation, Senator Collins, but I think we should suggest that Senator Chipp had better motivations than that, because he did have a deep belief in liberal principles and in the values of democracy. Of course, those sorts of principles have been sold out by the Democrats. But if the price is a 300 per cent increase in free advertising time, one would have to wonder at some of Senator Sowada's colleagues who have supported the Bill. I congratulate Senator Sowada on her stand on principle during a number of the divisions today. We welcome her presence because she perhaps is the embodiment of a new style of Democrat coming into this chamber who will make up his or her own mind, who will not caucus, as many of her colleagues seem to have done since I have been here, and who will stick to some of the principles that Senator Chipp founded the party on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada also should consider the effect that the legislation will have on her Democrat colleagues in some of the States in which no Democrats are sitting in the State parliaments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that one of the worst aspects of the legislation before the Senate is that it entrenches the position of the major parties. It is very hard to see how the arbitrary break-up of free time to political parties has been determined, with 40 per cent for the Government, 40 per cent for the Opposition, 10 per cent for the Democrats and 10 per cent for the rest. It must be an arbitrary break-up. I do not know what it reflects. It certainly does not reflect support for the major political parties.

If the Democrats did have that support, and I am sure the Democrats have had 10 per cent of support in some elections&mdash;they certainly do not in my home State at the moment&mdash;and if time were allocated on the level of support achieved by any political party at a previous election, that would only reflect the level of support three years ago, not the political reality at the time. Say the Australian Labor Party were to totally pull itself to bits&mdash;if the glue between the factions was to be in the sun for too long, and Senator McKiernan could not communicate with his Centre Left colleagues and his Right colleagues and do this deal to keep the Party sticking together and it all fell apart as it did a few decades ago&mdash;and form into a number of other Labor parties such as the DLP, ALP and the Centre Left Labor Party, that of course would make a mockery of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make, and I am being very longwinded about it, is that an arbitrary break-up can reflect only the political reality at the time. As we see in the Morgan gallup poll in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, support for the Opposition is nearer 50 per cent and for the Labor Party nearer 35 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more serious point I want to make is that in some of the States support for independents is growing. The entrenched support for existing parties enshrined in this Bill gives an enormous advantage to major parties and to the Democrats. I put to the Senate that, with the Democrats moving further and further to the Left in politics and deserting the centre ground that Don Chipp so carefully chipped out for them, there indeed exists a place in the Australian political spectrum for a true centre party. We see emerging in Western Australia at the moment a group called the Independent Liberals, which has been referred to by unkind journalists as a party with no members and no finance and whose members could fit into a telephone booth&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne should withhold his emotion because I know he has little time for the Independent Liberals in Western Australia. But the point is that the Democrats have deserted the centre ground. It could happen very quickly that another group, be it the Independent Liberals or some other group of political activists, could easily create a party of the true centre, not a party like the Australian Democrats that advocates higher taxes, bigger government and more government intervention, but one that seeks a true centre ground between the policies of the coalition as proposed by Dr Hewson and the strange mixture of policies pursued by the present Government. I put it to the Senate that allocating the free time on the basis described in the Bill does not reflect the changing nature of Australian politics and the way that Australian politics could change over the next decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that is important to us is the matter of the lack of public outcry over this business. We have had many people coming before the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, but it is fair to say that even after this all-night sitting there are not people marching on Parliament House waving banners and marching in the streets to protest against this incredible infringement of political rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also fair to say that there are some very good reasons for that. Most people that I know, when elections come on, get absolutely sick and tired of the bombardment they receive. I think it is also a matter of record that electronic advertising has increased significantly in the past eight years. That is, in my belief, to some extent a product of the sorts of relationships formed by people like the Prime Minister and his friends in the business community. That is well reported and well documented, but by people like John Pilger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the relationship nurtured by Brian Burke, the former Premier of Western Australia and former Ambassador to Ireland as appointed by this Government, with members of the John Curtin Foundation. That has opened up an incredible new source of funds for the Labor Party at both the Federal and State level. And of course this increased the amount of funding available to the Labor Party and increased the amount of electronic media advertising. This Bill is a reaction to that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another probably less important point but one again for the Democrats to consider is the impact this will have on shifting political advertising to direct marketing and to newspaper advertising. I put it to the Democrats, and I put it to the very green benches of the Government, that shifting advertising towards direct marketing will increase enormously the amount of paper used. We have already seen increased numbers of laser printers and increased photocopying allowances and stationery allowances in our own parliamentary offices. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 September of this year I appeared before the Senate Select Committee established to investigate this Bill and put the position that I did not support a ban on paid party political advertising.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This view is, I believe, supported by our party's electoral reform policy which was balloted and declared in October 1990. I have not resiled from this view and stand here as a lone voice on this part of the cross-benches.

I place on the record my opposition to this Bill and my right to say so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Government has persisted with this legislation in the face of widespread opposition by community groups and other wiser heads than ours must surely underscore the need on the part of those sitting on the Government benches to deal with their inability, their own indebtedness, their own inability to manage campaign budgets and their own desperate attempts to cling onto power. It is a sorry day when a government finds that the only way it can stay in office is to prevent others, by law, from expressing an opinion. And that is exactly what this legislation seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is based on the premise that controlling electronic advertising, currently a major component of total election expenses, will lead to a reduction in the need for parties to obtain donations and hence a lessening of political corruption. What a joke this is. The connection between the costs of advertising and corruption is a figment of the Government's imagination. It is already evident to serious political commentators that funds will simply be channelled into other forms of campaigning such as direct mail, billboards, newspapers, telemarketing and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn briefly to the issue of direct mail. In the United States, direct mail is already regarded by many congressional candidates as a more effective and highly targeted method of delivering a campaign message&mdash;indeed, more cost-effective than blanket TV advertising. Both parties, Liberal and Labor, are investing considerable sums of money in direct mail and direct mail technologies, as I have already demonstrated through my evidence to the Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, we discovered that, owing to an oversight in the New South Wales State Electoral Office, suppressed personal details of all voters in New South Wales were handed out to the Liberal and Labor Parties on a computer tape. Although these tapes are apparently on their way back to the State Electoral Office, it must surely be impossible to assess or patrol how far this information has now been spread around the State. A company was in the business of selling this database information to Liberal Party members of parliament in New South Wales. Given that the Labor Party is about three years ahead of the coalition in terms of direct mail technologies, it is no wonder that the Government sees some advantage in ensuring that it will have more funds to spend in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All parliamentarians will be spending more money on direct mail. Anyone who thinks that direct mail will lead to a more informed debate, a more educated electorate, less manipulation of the truth, fewer lies and fewer dirty tricks has not understood the American experience where the slogan is, `You can never send enough mail'. Direct mail works. Those who claim that it does not, probably also believe that tobacco advertising only causes teenagers to change brands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To gain further appreciation of how overall expenditure will be allocated if this ban becomes law, one need only look to New South Wales&mdash;once again&mdash;and the very expensive newspaper campaign being waged currently by the tobacco companies over plans to limit tobacco advertising. Day after day we have been subjected to full page advertisements and political propaganda designed to influence opinion. One could be forgiven for thinking that there was an election in the air, although I do not think the Greiner Government has quite made up its mind on this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, despite this graphic evidence, we see no sign in this Bill of any moves to regulate advertising in newspapers or magazines. It will be open slather for political parties and lobby groups to advertise in the print media without restriction. There is nothing free about that; it will cost considerable sums of money, for which donations will still be needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at this ban. The Government is proposing a complete ban on all political advertising during elections, to apply to all parties, candidates and third parties&mdash;that is, lobby groups&mdash;who wish to express an opinion in the electronic media. In its place, we have free time on television, rationed out to registered political parties and candidates according to a predetermined formula which doles out 40 per cent of the time each to the coalition and the Labor Party, 10 per cent to the Democrats and 10 per cent to everyone else. The Government has decided that there is to be no free time on radio, thereby excluding this medium altogether from political comment, except that which is filtered through the biased judgments of journalists and news editors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This regime proposed by the Government simply reinforces the status quo. Free speech is severely limited. People who may wish to criticise the Government will have their wings clipped. Independent candidates and new parties will have a very limited opportunity to communicate with the electorate. Candidates in large rural electorates will find it particularly difficult to campaign over a wide geographical area without the aid of the electronic media. Community groups, be they the mining industry, conservation groups, social justice organisations or anyone else, will be frozen out of the process by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, every party in this place will be at the mercy of journalists, announcers, television presenters, subeditors, editorial writers and news editors, who will make decisions about what they believe is important news, slanted by their personal opinion or that of their proprietor. What chance will candidates have to respond quickly and effectively to attacks with a message unadulterated by the red pen of a news editor? None. We have all had complaints in the past about the coverage of our Party and candidates at election time, but at least some redress has been available through paid advertising. That will now go out the window. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the States? This ban now covers all future State and Territory elections. I asked the Minister: are the States happy with this state of affairs? I am sure the Labor Party in New South Wales is leaping with joy at the prospect of saving millions of dollars at the next State election, which may be earlier rather than later. But what right do we have, sitting here in Canberra, to regulate the affairs of elections in other States, which are governed by their own electoral Acts in every other respect? None whatsoever. It is a stolen mandate, born of desperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have suggested that speech is not free if it has to be paid for. There is no question that the current regime benefits those who have more money to spend on advertising. I believe that is part of the cut and thrust of politics. I would also maintain that there are many aspects of our society which are not free. Better health care and education services can be bought at a price. It is no longer possible to get adequate legal representation unless a person is wealthy, because legal aid has been restricted so fiercely. Indeed, this Labor Government has been at the forefront of winding back services and implementing the user pays philosophy over a wide range of programs and activities which it had previously supplied to voters as a public service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats are supporting this Bill because they believe that somehow we will benefit, or that the political process and debate will somehow magically improve, I would suggest to my colleagues that we have been sold a very lame steer.

There has been a fundamental failure to recognise that in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So now we find ourselves banning political advertising in an effort to curb the burgeoning debts of the Labor Party. It knows that it will not be able to compete with the coalition at the next election. Seven million dollars of debt in New South Wales alone, we are told, and I ask what party, already on the skids, can afford to mount an electronic advertising campaign when saddled with that sort of debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Opposition and to the Government that, if they want to limit campaign costs, they should look unto their own houses and have the courage to spend less. They should have the courage to reject the overtures of snake oil dealers who would donate money in return for favours on legislation. And they should have the courage to show some moral fortitude by rejecting the temptation to corrupt conduct, as the potential for it will not be lessened by the implications of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask the Government what it is afraid of that such draconian measures have to be taken to prevent public criticism, restrict free speech and stop people from having a say. When the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, came out and publicly repudiated the notion of the ban on advertising as a means of controlling spiralling campaign costs, one has to wonder what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list goes on. I quote the International Commission of Jurists, in the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rule of Law and Human Rights&mdash;Principles and Definitions</EMPHASIS>, published in 1966, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Freedom of expression through the press and other media of communication is an essential element of free elections and is also necessary to ensure the development of an informed and responsible electorate.</PARA>
<PARA>I further quote from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is in schedule 2 of the Government's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. Article 19.2 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right includes freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Government: where is its support for international treaties and covenants, signed on behalf of the Australian people and on behalf of this Parliament&mdash;covenants, the terms of which are enshrined in our own legislation? I ask the Minister: will this Bill end up in the High Court, to be challenged under the external affairs power enshrined in section 51, clause 39, of the Australian Constitution? A successful challenge would only prove what a sham this legislation really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already stated, I reject the nexus between the cost of political advertising, corruption and disclosure. Political corruption will not be minimised by banning advertising, but by the implementation of a full, fair, open and transparent disclosure regime&mdash;a principle which is fully supported by the Australian Democrats. I have already indicated that it is my belief that this money saved on political advertising will simply be channelled into other forms of campaigning. This is already happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have campaigned long and hard in my own State for strengthened donation disclosure laws. The disclosure side of this legislation goes a long way to addressing concerns expressed by the Australian Electoral Commission and corruption fighters in Australia in respect of parties and lobby groups. The Government is to be commended for having the courage to clean up many of the loopholes that have been identified. </PARA>

<PARA>He further said:</PARA>

<PARA>This Bill does address some of those issues&mdash;but at what price, when the nexus drawn between the cost of electronic advertising and disclosure is totally spurious in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And still there are some holes left in the Bill. For example, there is no guarantee that substantial funding given to independent candidates for election expenses shortly after an election will ever be disclosed, because the disclosure period for them expires the minute the polls close. This means that the Labor and Liberal parties will probably find some mechanism to channel money into the hands of so-called `dummy independents'&mdash;who are simply sycophants for their masters&mdash;by siphoning money off to those candidates after the election. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we are still protecting the identity of donors who give less than the prescribed amount. I ask: if a donor chooses to give $999 to a candidate or group, where is the open, transparent nature of disclosure laws which protects donors below a certain limit? If a disclosure regime is to have integrity, any moral force and a shred of credibility, we must have it all on the table where the public can see dollars and see who is attempting to buy political influence in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to question the commitment of both sides of this House to full disclosure. How many State governments have followed suit with meaningful disclosure laws? Despite the scandals, despite the public outcry, despite the brown paper bags and despite the fact that 74 per cent of people polled in a recent Saulwick poll said that party political donors should be named, we still have State governments dragging their feet, caught up in committees and trying to wriggle out of meaningful disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State Premiers all over the country have been put on notice by public demands for action, the advice of their own corruption inquiries and the evidence of scandals in their own backyard. I guess we will not see the loopholes in the disclosure laws until after the next election, when someone has yet again found a way of getting around the law and thumbing his nose at the Electoral Commission, which will stand by helpless and unable to act as it has done so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my initial point in respect of disclosure. Is full disclosure worth the price of gagging free speech and debate? People around the world have fought and died for this very right&mdash;the right to express an opinion&mdash;and yet here, with this legislation, we are throwing it away fundamentally and utterly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the fallacious link between the ban on advertising and disclosure, a link which has been repudiated by most respectable commentators, the Human Rights Commissioner and numerous witnesses before the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, I call on the Government to do the decent thing and separate the Bill, so that we can debate disclosure and advertising on their merits as separate issues, as they should be debated. This I would be happy to support. A reduction in political corruption is inexorably linked to meaningful and transparent political donation disclosure laws&mdash;laws which expose the shady deals, the bought influence and politicians who are simply sycophants for their business mates. </PARA>

If I am not wrong, Mr Hogg has been charged with not disclosing some millions, and I make no criticism of that&mdash;he just could not keep up with the paperwork.

But the reason we have royal commissions is that we have not had proper scrutiny, we have not had proper disclosure, we have not had proper examination, and we have not had proper accountability. The reason why in Western Australia a former High Court judge, a sitting member of the Supreme Court and a retired member of the Supreme Court are sitting as a royal commission, which is going to take 18 months and which requires individual sittings by those commissioners because the references are so extensive, is that there has not been proper scrutiny of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been, as many speakers have said tonight, a long period extending over some years leading up to this. We have had the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures look at this matter. A number of witnesses have come before that Committee. There have been more than enough opportunities for people in the community to bring their concerns to the Committee and for them to be expressed through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of the evidence given to that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal, first, with the matter of the survey which we conducted among Australian Democrat members. While it is certainly true that surveys show that Democrat members are, on the whole, better educated and more intelligent than those who vote for other parties, I think the result of that survey probably does not differ too much from where the public is coming from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our survey showed that 92 per cent of our members were dissatisfied with the existing processes of advertising political material. Ninety-two per cent were dissatisfied with the deception, the disingenuousness, the deceit and the superficiality, which were well exemplified and dealt with in Senator Kernot's speech. Only 4 per cent were happy with the status quo, and the other 4 per cent were undecided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we asked our members to comment on proposals that are likely to come forward, 75 per cent of them either strongly agreed, or agreed, with a proposal very similar to the one before the Senate now, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>that is, a ban on advertising during the election period, talking heads and free time. Moreover, specifically dealing with Senator Sowada's claim, an overwhelming majority&mdash;nearly 90 per cent of our members&mdash;opposed free time plus paid advertising. So what I am saying reflects the results of a democratically conducted survey of our members whose view I believe is not all that dissimilar from the view of those in the general community who would support the other parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the cost of political advertising has been raised. A number of speakers have made the point that the limitation on spending of money by political parties on television advertising will result in a flow of that available resource into other forms of political advertising, particularly postage to electors. I find that passing strange in view of the amount of money which Mr Blunt spent on postage in the last election. The claim by the Opposition, with that very recent experience in mind, simply does not hold up. I find it quite deceptive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to take a slightly different view. Television is undoubtedly the most powerful and persuasive medium which has ever been introduced into any society. It has the ability to persuade, to deceive and to convince people, not by argument but by all the subtle techniques developed by highly trained psychologists, whom Senator Kernot spoke about so well in her speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The television medium has been allowed to be used to determine the government which this country shall have. I simply pose the question: should the allocation of time on that powerful medium be determined by the amount of money available to particular parties and by the very powerful and very influential supporters of those parties, or should it be determined in a democratic manner? I would argue that it is a fundamental plank of a true democracy that it should be determined in a democratic manner. That is precisely what this Bill does. It allocates time in relation to community support for political parties, not in accordance with the amount of money which a party can raise and spend. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not worrying about the workers. I am talking about local government. The Government has been saying for a very long time that it sees local government as the third tier of government. What it seems to have forgotten in this exercise is that voting in local government elections is not compulsory. They are the only elections in the three tiers of government in which voting is not compulsory. Very few people&mdash;Ted Mack, perhaps&mdash;spend a lot on television advertising in local government elections. Most local government candidates spend what little money they have on radio advertising and also, if they can afford it, a few pictures and a few words in the local newspaper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that radio advertising is so important to local government is that, because voting in those elections is not compulsory, candidates have to get out and sell themselves and try to get people to vote for them. Also, in the few weeks leading up to a local government election, thank heavens, commercial radio and even the ABC run frequent programs encouraging people to vote. That is what local government is all about. Those people who are interested in supporting their local candidates vote for them because they want to, not because they have to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the provisions of this Bill relating to radio come into effect, they will take away a very important part of local government elections. In the one or two weeks leading up to elections, the local radio stations run talkback shows, they promote the local government elections, they fire the local people up with their local issues and they encourage people to vote and to do their bit for democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In North Sydney Ted Mack, MP, as mayor, started citizen initiated referendums in conjunction with council elections. One of them was about whether to ban live animals from circuses. That particular matter became known to the public only a week or so before the election. It was promoted through the media. If it had not been for the media the people in the circuses who were trying to defend themselves would not have heard anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue was publicised in the local media in the week leading up to the election, and I am pleased to say&mdash;although it depends on which side of the fence you are on&mdash;that 60 per cent of the people who voted in North Sydney, some 8,000 people, voted in favour of live animals in circuses. Had this sort of legislation been in place, not only would the North Sydney City Council have been able to force something on the people or taken away the livelihood of some businesses, but a minority group of businesses in our community, the circus people, would have been denied the opportunity to have their say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we are all tied up in party politics in Canberra and in the States, there are local government bodies in Australia that are non-political. In Tasmania, all our local governments are non-political, and they believe in using the media, particularly broadcasting, to promote their cases. If that opportunity is taken away from them, it will perpetuate the sitting members. The new candidates coming along with their local views and their local background will have no hope of promoting their cause. Let us face it&mdash;it is only in the last week or two coming up to an election that anybody takes any notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government candidates do not have the facilities we have to organise large mail-out campaigns. They cannot afford to go on television. They do use radio and newspapers to a certain extent, radio in particular. This legislation will disadvantage new local government candidates right around Australia. It will also reduce the interest that has been generated in local government. It is a pity that the third tier of government is to be affected by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I will get back on another hobbyhorse of mine&mdash;radio broadcasting. I must say that I was horrified to hear that the Government has decided that radio will be treated in a worse fashion than television.

I know that the radio stations themselves are saying, `Why are we missing out?'. After all is said and done, with the advent of FM radio stations there has been some sort of self-regulation whereby they have reduced the number of advertisements they have. Obviously, the time they give to advertising is rather expensive.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Shirley said his members would not condone such a totalitarian attack on one of the basic tenets of democracy, that being the freedom of speech, whether on the basis of commercial impact or for any other reason. A ban on political advertisements would not inhibit, and in fact would no doubt greatly accelerate, the flow of political media releases to radio and television stations. Some broadcasters might not feel well disposed to political media releases in circumstances of an advertising ban.</PARA>

<PARA>I believe this has been covered to some extent in the Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or who had literacy problems. Many other sectors within the community including special interest and philanthropic organisations could also be caught by the proposed legislation and prevented from presenting their views by the use of radio or television advertising.

As a consequence of its overall mismanagement the Party is broke and faces the next election in abject panic.</PARA>
<PARA>This was back in March. How true it was. The release concluded:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No honourable senators from the other side can ever again trumpet their commitment to democracy&mdash;not just because they are supporting this anti-democratic legislation but because of the way in which they have supported this guillotined method of debating it. On both counts, it is the worst trampling on democratic rights that I have seen since I first became a member of this Parliament some 16 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, this night has been Australia's Night of the Long Knives. Just as democracy died in Germany under Hitler's jack booted henchmen on the Night of the Long Knives, so over this night an important element of democracy is being killed in Australia on our Night of the Long Knives by Hawke's henchmen in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation makes some of the most far-reaching changes that could possibly be imagined to democratic life as Australians have known it for generations. To ban political advertising on the electronic media is a savage attack on democracy. To ram such far-reaching changes through this chamber in less than 48 hours is a travesty of the Senate. To do so in the context of the Government itself tabling some 37 amendments on the eve of the debate and a further 14 amendments during the debate overnight is beyond the comprehension of any committed democrat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is clearly determined to avoid wider public scrutiny of its proposals. We should ask why. The answer is that the Government now lives in very fear of the Australian public. It knows that Australians, if given a direct choice, would not have a bar of this legislation. It also knows that Australians, if given a direct choice now, would no longer have a bar of the Hawke Labor Government. Today's Morgan gallup poll again confirms a consistent lead of the Liberal and National parties over the Labor Government and indeed John Hewson over Bob Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the Government is running scared. It will not allow this legislation proper public scrutiny. But worse, through this very legislation, it seeks to shield its disastrous record in government from proper public scrutiny. Not only does the Government want to shield this legislation from scrutiny but through this legislation it wants to shield its own disastrous public record from proper scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is there such a rush with this legislation? Is the Prime Minister rushing to an election to forestall yet another challenge from the honourable member for Blaxland, or is the legislation designed to shield one of the Labor State Premiers from proper scrutiny in an early State election? The only purpose of this legislation is to salvage the semblance of an effective campaign for the Labor Party at the next election. It can no longer conduct a successful campaign through the traditional use of electronic media because in previous campaigns it has mismanaged its finances, just as it has mismanaged this country's finances, and so is broke, just as Australia is broke under the Government's administration. Labor is broke because it spent whatever was necessary to win past elections rather than what it could raise in fundraising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor is also immensely and justifiably unpopular because of the havoc it has wreaked on the lives of so many Australians, not the least being the one million unemployed. So it has no hope of raising funds for its next campaign. Hence we have this legislation to eliminate a major source of campaign expenditure. Coincidentally, as I have already mentioned, it eliminates the most effective medium for exposing Labor's failures. So Labor will substitute, at taxpayer expense, other campaign techniques such as direct mail and telemarketing which can be initiated from parliamentary electorate offices. In this it has the acquiescence and support of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All through the night during this debate the Democrats have refused to answer the questions we have put to them on how they would benefit from this legislation. The figures given earlier by Senator Kemp show that the free time available to them under this legislation would equal some $1.8m. That represents six times the advertising expenditure of the Democrats at the last election. Senator Kernot and Senator Coulter, in their speeches on this legislation throughout the night, have not been able to refute in any way those figures given by Senator Kemp. So the Democrats, as well as the Government, gain a massive advantage from this legislation. But that is done to the exclusion of the Liberal and National parties and other interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation simply seeks to reduce the campaigning capacity of those who wish to be rid of Labor at the next election to the level of Labor's own campaigning capacity. It seeks to hamstring not only the Liberal and National parties but also the growing number of community groups who want Labor thrown from office. Why should any group in our community have its capacity to take its message directly to the Australian people through the most effective medium&mdash;television&mdash;destroyed?  No organisation should be dependent on the interpretive whims of television news editors as to whether its message gets through or whether it gets left on the cutting room floor. It is a travesty of democracy. Freedom to advertise must remain an important element in the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September, I had the privilege of leading the official international observer mission at the inaugural direct elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Advertising on the electronic media was not allowed during that recent campaign. One of the major recommendations of that observer mission&mdash;which was an international mission with representatives from a number of countries&mdash;was that electronic media advertising should be allowed for elections in Hong Kong to be more completely democratic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any reasonable reading of the majority conclusions and recommendations of this Committee confirms quite clearly that they do not reflect the evidence given to that Committee at its various hearings. They reflect neither the written submissions nor, in fact, the verbal evidence presented to the Committee. This can be seen clearly from a perusal of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reports of Committee proceedings. I was shocked when perusing these <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reports not only to see the obvious inconsistency between the evidence and the majority report, but also because of its revelations of the unacceptable behaviour of the Committee Chairman, Senator Schacht. I have to say that this came as an enormous shock and disappointment to me.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> I serve with Senator Schacht on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which is generally regarded as the most prestigious committee of this Parliament. Senator Schacht is Chairman of that Committee, and a more mild mannered and courteous chairman you would not care to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So honourable senators can imagine my shock and horror when I compared his behaviour on the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee with his behaviour as the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee in relation to this legislation. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> shows that he rudely interrupted, hectored and badgered witnesses in an attempt to intimidate them to abandon their opposition to this legislation. That is quite unacceptable behaviour from a committee chairman and I hope we never see it repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even that was not good enough for Senator Schacht. He then ensured that a committee report was presented which, as I have already said, ignored the evidence put before the Committee.

Despite all of that, the Committee's majority report, in supporting this legislation, ignores the overwhelming evidence against it by the majority of submissions and witnesses. The only conclusion capable of being reached is that the majority report, as I said, was written with a specific goal in mind: the Government's goal of getting this legislation through and giving comfort to this specific legislation, rather than in fact reflecting the evidence that was put before the Committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of whether the proposal is radical, let me just say at this stage very briefly&mdash;and I will go into it later&mdash;that what has been proposed is something that is common throughout the world; it is common throughout western democracies. We are in fact one of only three countries with absolutely no controls on political advertising. This measure rectifies that in a way which is consistent with international positions. So let us get that straight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to another reason put forward for the agitation of and the performance put on by honourable senators opposite, I point out that this matter is not new to this place. It has been before the Parliament for some four years now by way of consideration by committees. In fact, two years ago the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who pays the piper calls the tune</EMPHASIS> was delivered to this Parliament by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters; the reference was commissioned in 1987. So the matter has been before the Parliament for some time with two parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made that we are producing amendments at a late stage. Half of the amendments raised for consideration by the Senate were tabled some 3 1/2 months ago on 13 August. With respect to the others, let me also say that the Government has been quite flexible in allowing the Opposition some extra time for the second of those parliamentary committees which I mentioned and, because of that, we have had to shorten the time available to us to prepare amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that we are not talking about anything radical or anything that is new to this Parliament, we have tonight had from those opposite a performance which basically can be likened to the performance of drama queens at a Mardi gras. The longer the night, the more outrageous the performance; the more outrageous, the more tedious. It has been a wasteful, fruitless night, but it is something that they have had to go through to go through the motions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in analysing the debate I need first to go to the motives of each party in the debate. We have been accused of having all sorts of motives. Let me say&mdash;and the record shows this&mdash;that the Australian Labor Party has been consistent in its approach to the necessity for electoral reform. From 1983 we have had in this area an agenda with two major arms: first, we wanted to contain the cost burden on the political participants; secondly, we wanted to make the process more transparent. A third arm, something very much a part of the agenda which was achieved early in the piece, was to make the system more democratic in terms of numbers in constituencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over eight or nine years, we introduced legislation to try to achieve these objectives. One attempt was for partial disclosure; another was for public funding. In 1987 it was quite apparent that those measures in themselves were not effective enough to handle the problem that was emerging both domestically and internationally, so in 1987 a reference was sent to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The Committee was to look at both costs and disclosure in terms of the political process. So, as I have said, the process has taken four years and two committees. Both those committees&mdash;the Joint Standing Committee and the Schacht Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, which has just reported&mdash;have made recommendations in the areas of disclosure and free time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, this is not a recent development for the Labor Party. For over a decade we have had a commitment to it and have taken measures towards it. The motive has always been twofold: first, to tackle the corruptive influence of the corporate dollar in the political process, recognising at all times that there is a legitimate role for corporate donations; secondly, to ensure that there is equity in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the corruption potential mean? In the course of the night I have listened to a number of speakers, but let me just go to one bit of evidence that went to the Schacht Committee. The potential for corruption is there and it is recognised that it is there. We have seen it operate at the State level; we have seen it operate internationally. It was even accepted by David Flint from the Australian Press Council in its submission to the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures. At point 7 on page 3 of its submission, it stated very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council notes and fully accepts the concern in the Parliament as to the potential for corruption which could result from large advertising budgets of political parties.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very clear, very succinct. That is the point that we have been concerned about. That is the point that has been stressed by not only the Australian Press Council, but also over recent years a whole range of committees at State level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corruption potential is one thing, undue influence is another. I think I have mentioned a number of times the aspect of undue influence. We have wanted to reduce the situation where, by the provision of money, people buy access into the process. Tony Eggleton is one person from the other side of politics who is on record as acknowledging that in the Fraser days, anyone who donated had a foot in the door much more quickly. In that situation, it is those people without money who are disadvantaged. That is the sort of situation that these proposals tackle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect that we have been concerned about is one that Senator Coulter raised a little while ago. What we are concerned about, thirdly, is the influence on directing the political agenda. In our system, the most basic democratic principle is the principle of one person, one vote; one vote, one value. As Senator Coulter said, if we have a situation as occurred in Western Australia a number of years ago when the legitimate voice of the Aboriginals was drowned out by the overwhelming force of misleading racist campaigns, we do not have a healthy democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let me just say at this particular stage that we have been intent on tackling both arms of the problem at the same time, both the disclosure aspect as well as a reduction in the reliance on corporate dollars&mdash;in fact a reduction in the need for parties to raise campaign funds. We need to do it now. Essentially, this is our last chance before we go down the way of other countries such as Japan and the USA, before the Federal system takes the turn that has happened in the States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Acting Deputy President. The point I was making is that we do have a big problem in Australia in terms of the costs of election campaigns. I was just about to say that we spend more per capita on a Federal election campaign than is spent on a US Congress election and there has been an enormous blow-out over the last three elections, from $5m to $10m to $15m on electronic advertising over those three elections. The point has been made from time to time that it is the Labor Party that outspends the other parties in the process. But, if one looks at the amount of money that was spent in the 1990 election, Labor spent in fact $14.7m all up; the Opposition, the Liberals and Nationals and CLP, spent $15.5m all up. That gives the lie to Senator Olsen's claim that the Labor Party spends more on election campaigns than does the Opposition. The Opposition parties spent almost one million dollars more than we did at the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I said earlier on, there is a problem. It has been recognised by this Government, but it has also been recognised internationally. As I have said, we are not standing alone in what we are doing. We are one of three countries that have a situation which the conservatives in this country want to preserve. The rest of the world, liberal democracies and the like, has taken some action to ensure that the process is regulated in the way that we are seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just an internationally recognised problem; it has been recognised domestically as well. The ICAC in New South Wales had this particular issue before it and what it recommended was what this Government is doing. It recommended that you cannot tackle one part of the problem on its own; you have to tackle both costs and disclosure in order to ensure that the system can be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of rhetoric over the last few hours about what we are doing and the democratic or otherwise nature of it. I refer the Senate, and anyone else who would like to take an interest in this, particularly our friends in the gallery, to page 111 of the report of the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, the Schacht report, where Appendix 5 is headed, `Political Advertisements: An International Comparison'. There one finds that what we are doing is very much in step with the rest of the world. The United Kingdom, for instance, has had and does have provisions that ensure less access to radio and television advertising than is proposed in this measure. Canada has regulation of it. France provides that political parties receive free time for advertising on state radio and television stations and a limited time thereafter for presidential campaigns and whatever. New Zealand, of course, is out on its own but it also allows for paid political advertisements. As we go down the list, we see that Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Israel, Japan and the Netherlands all provide in one way or another for free time and for regulation of political advertisements. We are not doing anything here that is out of the ordinary in the international agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also at this stage tackle the point on motivation which I started to address earlier on. We are motivated by an international recognition of the problem, by the fact that State royal commissions have recognised the problem and by the fact that we have to act to ensure that the system stays democratic. I think Senator Macdonald made the point that we have been driven by the fact that we are broke. I say to Senator Macdonald that on 9 July this year the newly elected Liberal Party President, Paul Everingham, admitted that the Liberal Party is almost broke and its election campaigns have been ineffective. That was the headline in a Brisbane newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of the matter is that, if the two major political parties in this country have problems financing their campaigns, what chance have the minor parties got?  What chance have new players in the process got? They have absolutely none at all. I go back to that particular point: whether in Queensland, Victoria or nationally, the Liberal Party is well and truly strapped and the Labor Party is having difficulties meeting the costs of campaigns. Both of us will be able to do it in the end; there is no doubt about that. But how democratic is it when we can hardly afford to pay for campaigns and the rest of the players in the field who want to play are denied access to the whole process? It is very undemocratic to the extent that it has been recognised by main players in the game in the US. Senator Barry Goldwater of the US Senate made it very clear&mdash;and this is the particular point that we are trying to address&mdash;when he said that it is not the people but the monied interests who are setting the nation's political agenda and are influencing the position of candidates on the important issues of the day. What we are doing here by this measure is ensuring that the situation that Barry Goldwater describes as operating in the US, and the situation that operated in Western Australia a number of years ago, does not repeat itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise to us that the Senate has been forced to sit for the number of hours that it has been forced to sit overnight. There has been one thing that has been consistent about those on the other side when it comes to issues in this area: whether it has been disclosure, public funding or measures to contain costs, they have shown absolutely no responsibility in addressing those issues. From day one, from March 1983 when we came into government, they have resisted every measure put up by this Government. On a State level they have resisted every measure put up by Labor governments and Labor parties. Even recently we had the promise from Nick Greiner&mdash;tricky Nick Greiner. He promised a number of years ago that he would introduce disclosure before the next election. Well, the next election has been and gone. We have not seen disclosure. We have seen a framework of committees set up. But, now that the election is over, he is running away from the issue&mdash;as he was always going to, and as those opposite have done historically over the last eight years. They do not want to grapple with the issue. They want unbridled, unregulated access in this area in a way which is most undemocratic. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What drives those opposite? They come in here claiming a commitment to human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's human rights record is one that is littered with, and permeated by, hypocrisy. In 1985-86 the Opposition parties opposed measures to enshrine the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights in the Australian Constitution. Their record has been consistent since then and before then. Their record on the Human Rights Commission has been to abolish it. That policy changed a fortnight ago. It is no longer to abolish it, it is now to create a shell out of it by reducing its funding by some $4m. In respect to the most recent attempt by this Government to entrench in the Constitution human rights and civil liberties&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What did they do? A proposal was put forward by a committee chaired by the former Premier of Victoria, Sir Rupert Hamer; what did they do, they opposed it. They have no consistency, no regard, no respect, and no track record on human rights. Their track record, in fact, is littered with hypocrisy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago they came up with a promise for the future in human rights. They mentioned HREOC, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which is an important mechanism in this country to monitor and protect human rights. It gives advice, and that advice has to be respected, although not always agreed with. But what are the Opposition parties going to do there? They are going to reduce it in a way that Jack Waterford in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> says will reduce its funding by $4m from a current figure of $9m. The funding used to be $6m before it gained responsibility for matters concerning privacy. So what they are doing with the Human Rights Commission is gutting it. All those people with whom they have been working on this will be sold down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two arms which are used by government to keep us in contact with international civil rights and human rights mechanisms. The other one is the international law division of the Attorney-General's Department. What does the Opposition intend doing with that? It will shut that right up. It will flick the function off to DFAT, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is the sort of respect the Opposition has for human rights in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does not end there. The most basic human right in this country is access to law. So what are Opposition members doing for those people who do not have access to law because they cannot afford it? They will cut back on legal aid by $10m. What will they do with protective security and the administration of justice? They will cut that back by another $17m. That is the sort of commitment the Opposition made to human rights in this country. It is totally cynical; it is totally hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not talk about the human rights of sole parents and migrants, or of Aboriginals, whose funding will be cut back by $90m. Let us not talk about the rights of community lobby groups whom the Opposition is targeting in this place. The Opposition's approach has been one of hypocrisy, but why should we expect any better. Opposition members have no respect for human rights. In February 1986, Senator Durack, the former Attorney-General, said, `We will not join in any international covenant to bring human rights to everybody'. What has the Opposition done in the last few months? It has cited a covenant that Senator Durack would never pay any respect to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, in terms of the hypocrisy, let me make another point. Opposition members are claiming that advertising is sacrosanct. Is it not strange? On 26 November 1990 it was John Hewson who made it very clear what he thought about advertising. He said, `I have no personal disposition against advertising'. He made it very clear. But it was not just him. Senators on the other side who have been bleating overnight about advertising had this to say in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who pays the piper calls the tune</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We reject as absurd the assertion that political advertising is a social good.</PARA>
<PARA>They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have seen no convincing evidence of any correlation between election results and either the quality or quantity of political advertising on the electronic media.</PARA>
<PARA>They also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems likely that it is the news and current affairs programs and not the party advertisements that provide the information which makes TV a significant influence on individual political choices.</PARA>
<PARA>They are on the record as saying that, but they come in here overnight claiming some commitment to human rights&mdash;newborn though it may be&mdash;but at the same time having absolutely no respect for the medium that they are wanting to protect. What is their real reason? They want to maintain a system. They want the right to buy influence; they want the right to corrupt; they do not want a level playing field, they want the strength of one's voice to depend on the balance of the bank account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill has had a gestation period of four years&mdash;two committees, a plethora of hearings, and hours of evidence from witnesses. Over that process there has been only one force that has been prepared to negotiate and that has been the Democrats, and they have been pretty good at it. I must say that at this particular stage though that it is not as the Opposition expects&mdash;there is not a deal in this respect. There is no guarantee that this legislation will come into law. It is going to take a number of hours during the course of the day to ensure that the legislation that is passed by the Senate is acceptable to the Government. At this stage I cannot say with any degree of certainty that what is going through this place will be proclaimed at the end of the day. The Bill has to go through the processes of the next few hours. The Democrats have at lease recognised the problem and they have been prepared to negotiate in a constructive manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals, of course, lead to a new era in political advertising, which will be informative and substantive. At this stage, before time runs out, I want to thank a number of people. I have already mentioned the Democrats' current leadership. I should also mention the role played by Senator Powell and her former staff member, Lesley Vick, over a period of time. The Senate Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures, Rosemary Laing and her secretariat, have to be recognised, and the Labor and Democrat senators on that Committee deserve particular mention. We had a great degree of work done by and support from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the Electoral Commission, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Transport and Communications, which should be recognised, as should the work of my staff and in particular John Richardson for the work he has committed to this over the last year or so. </PARA>

But there is one aspect of this which still remains to be tested. As I said, the Bill is not through the Parliament yet and we do have to go through a number of processes during which we will find out whether the Liberal Party is serious on disclosure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic principle governing the Government's position on disclosure is well and truly summarised in ICAC, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is a conflict between the public interest and the convenience of the major political parties, the public interest must be allowed to prevail. What disclosure is about is fairness and openness between the political process, the political parties and the public. It is the public's right to know.</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberals have tossed in a number of smokescreens. Statements have been made by party apparatchiks, whether it be Goldsworthy or Robb, and we remain to be convinced that it is possible to draft legislation to meet the fairness and equity test they propose. The test is not a question of fairness and equity; the test is whether it is transparent or not to the public. And that is what dictates the Government's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got to see, and we will wait to see, how the Liberals line up on the question of income and expenditure as opposed to donations, which is what they have always talked about; how they line up on spot audits, which they have opposed by legal and other measures in the past; and how they line up on the question of discrimination&mdash;and there are measures in the Bill to handle that&mdash;and so on. The simple, basic thing about disclosure is that it is the individual's right to know, the public's right to know; and we will see how those opposite line up on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, in conclusion, just let me make one point. The package, as I said, does lay the basis for a new era in campaigning. In doing so, it protects the honest donor, it provides a transparent system for the public and it provides information for the public. It is not there yet. The next 11 hours or so will show how the Bill finally comes through the Parliament and whether it is in a form which is acceptable to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic thing has probably best been put by Michael Gawenda in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time Australia </EMPHASIS> magazine on 13 May when discussing this issue. His article was entitled `The Price Tag for Free Speech'. I think Gawenda in the last paragraph sums up the motivation of the Government and also the motivation, from what I can elicit from Senator Coulter's statement earlier on, of the Democrats. He says:</PARA>
