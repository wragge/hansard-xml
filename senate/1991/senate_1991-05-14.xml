<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. I refer the Minister to reports today that the Government has decided to send HMAS Darwin back to the Persian Gulf region to participate in the enforcement of sanctions against Iraq. Will the Opposition be consulted about this deployment, as it has been in the previous deployments? Will the Prime Minister or the Minister be making a statement to Parliament about this deployment and any future deployments of this kind in the Gulf as the sanctions are still maintained?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not believe that the current circumstances anywhere near equate with the circumstances of the initial commitment or the commitment of other ships that we made late last year. The commitment of HMAS Darwin here is just continuing an Australian flag presence in the Gulf whilst we await further resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. If the proposition is put seriously to me that this is a breach of faith or that we have not followed proper procedures, I would argue that the circumstances are different. Nevertheless, if Senator Durack is of that view I will entertain it and ensure that consultation occurs in future. I did not think that these circumstances, given the threat assessment, et cetera, were anything like they were last year. But, if it is Senator Durack's view that he would like to be consulted in a continuing way on these developments, I will undertake to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In view of the fact that there is obviously to be a continuing process of sanctions against Iraq for perhaps an indefinite period, I did ask whether there was going to be a statement in relation to that matter as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I refer to the previous part of my answer. It depends on the objective circumstances at the time and the seriousness of the decision. I deploy ships to different parts of the globe every day of the week almost, but I do not necessarily make a parliamentary statement on it. I would have thought it would come as no surprise to Senator Durack or anyone else that, as long as the United Nations sanctions are maintained in the Gulf, Australia should have a role to play. That may not be the view of every country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes and no. In any event, the last thing I want to see happen is only one country left to enforce the sanctions in the Gulf. That would be most unfair and it would develop the sort of paranoia that exists in some parts of the world when only one country is part of this sort of process. We would encourage as many of our allies as possible to have an ongoing presence in the Gulf until the United Nations deems that it is time for it to be wound back.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Can the Minister advise the Senate of the Government's intentions with regard to the recognition of conscientious objection to military service?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3227" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week Cabinet gave approval for me to introduce, probably in the spring session depending on drafting resources, legislation covering the area of conscientious objection. The legislation that I intend to introduce stems from the Government's response to a Senate committee report which considered a private member's Bill introduced into this chamber by my colleague Senator Tate, which first raised the issue of broadening the grounds for conscientious objection to military service. I acknowledge that this issue has been around for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically, the amendments will provide for the classes of person who may be called up in the time of the war to be prescribed by regulations rather than specified in the Act. This will have the effect of removing the discriminatory provisions now in the Act and provide flexibility to address our requirements for the future responses to threats at that time. It will provide a requirement for parliamentary approval prior to a call up proclamation being made. It will also provide comprehensive provisions within the legislation for conscientious belief.</PARA>
<PARA> The areas that we will cover will do the following: clearly define the term `conscientious belief'; provide the right for a person to claim exemption from compulsory service in a particular war or warlike operation; enable the establishment of new tribunals to determine claims of conscientious objection; provide for a review of tribunal decisions on the grounds of material change in circumstances; and finally, provide an appeal mechanism through the appropriate court system.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we will repeal the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Termination Act 1973. I hasten to say that these Acts are already defunct. Should the question of conscription ever arise in this country, this Government will only consider it in circumstances of a direct threat to Australia. Before the rumour-mongers get going and misrepresent what I say, the Government has no intention, now or in the future, of introducing conscription.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. In 1982 the now Treasurer and his senior Australian Labor Party colleagues described the Australian economy as being in a state of depression when the rate of unemployment reached 9.4 per cent. As the rate of unemployment today is at 9.9 per cent, using the Treasurer's own yardstick, is Australia in depression?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It signifies incompetence in the case of the then Government. A whole range of indicators in 1982 were sufficient to induce a severe state of depression, as anyone who contemplated those indicators would know. In 1982, those in government were in a situation where they had a highly static economy which was over-regulated, which had not been subject to the wand of any structural adjustment at all. That Government had sat on its hands for seven years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No doubt I will get an opportunity to answer a question from Senator Kemp on these issues. As I was just saying, structural adjustment in the Australian economy was necessary but it was delayed by people of conservative mind-set-the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia-hand in hand, walking down the maze of non-progress which they followed in those days. In terms of all these structural issues, no progress had been made at all, so I think we are entitled to be depressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security, in the context of Mother's Day just past and to correct a figure which the Parliamentary Library gave me last week. Does the Minister recall that in 1976 family allowance payments to mothers replaced the tax rebate for children? Was this in fact not a transfer from the hip pocket of the taxpayer father to the purse of the mother? Is it not a fact that, because of the lost value of family allowances since then, successive Federal governments have robbed the purses of mothers of $7 billion-and I emphasise that $7 billion-as distinct from the $18 billion that the Parliamentary Library gave me last week? It has given me the corrected figure today. Senator Grimes, the then Minister for Social Security, told the national economic summit conference:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . that family allowances are not and were never meant to be a welfare program in the strict sense. Rather, they are designed to achieve a broad measure of equity in the tax transfer system between those with and those without dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of that comment, when is the Government going to restore the full value of family allowances, which are now only two-thirds of their 1976 value?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3229" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, the statement that former Senator Grimes made, that family allowances were not meant to be welfare payments, is as true today as it was when he made it. It was about recognising that families with children have special burdens placed upon them and it was an attempt to deal with those problems. I concur that it was not the case that family allowances were welfare payments. I have been asked whether successive governments have robbed mothers' purses, I think was the phrase, of $6 billion. Whatever we have our hands in, I hope we do not have our hands in mothers' purses around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In looking at the real value of family allowances, it is important to look at the packages as a whole. When one looks at the reforms to the tax system during the course of the last six or seven years, there have been some significant reductions in tax rates, which benefit all Australian families. I do not think one single benefit can be singled out. Currently in the portfolio, I am looking at all benefits, allowances and supplements. I will be making some recommendations on those allowances to the expenditure review committee of Cabinet. Unfortunately, I cannot share my thoughts on that with Senator Harradine at the present time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, although initially I would have wished to ask it of the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Is it true that the gemfish population has been rapidly and progressively depleted in recent years despite the setting of total allowable catch levels by Federal Government authorities-a TAC of 3,000 tonnes in 1988-89, a catch of only 2,000 tonnes; a TAC of 1,750 tonnes in 1990 but a catch of only 700 tonnes? Is it true that much of the fishing effort has switched to the orange roughy, for which a TAC of 24,000 tonnes has been set? How comprehensive is the research data which underpins the setting of this TAC of 24,000 tonnes? In view of the fact that this is a relatively new fishery, that the orange roughy has a lifespan, when not fished, of perhaps 100 years and is a very slow growing fish, what assurance can the Federal Government give that this fish will not follow the fate of the gemfish?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the article in today's Sydney Morning Herald alleging that the Government has sent a secret mission to South Africa to discuss economic policy in post-apartheid South Africa. What is the purpose of this visit? Is it correct to describe it as a secret mission?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing remotely secret about that visit, nor was it intended to be secret at any stage. It is just part of the ongoing process of developing a pattern of helpful cooperation with the future government of South Africa and rendering such assistance as we can in helping it to improve its policy processes and, in this instance, its capacity in relation to economic policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The background to the visit is the discussions that the Prime Minister had specifically on this subject with leaders of the anti-apartheid movement and, in particular, Nelson Mandela during his visit to Australia last year.

<PARA> The team, which is led by Ross Garnaut, is visiting South Africa from 9 May to 16 May to look at what kind of assistance might be developed. Professor Garnaut is one of Australia's most highly respected economists, particularly in the field of development economics, with substantial international experience. The team is consulting with a wide range of people who will be influential in developing South Africa's post-apartheid economic policy. The visit was discussed with South African Government officials.</PARA>
<PARA> The team will be talking to such government officials, not just as a courtesy but also because of the understanding it has about the future of the economy and the contribution it can make to our understanding of what, in turn, we can contribute to developing further policy thought in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> After the team has returned to Australia, it will present recommendations to government, and we will then decide on what assistance may be appropriate. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau will then be tasked to follow up on the Government's decision. It would be premature at this stage to speculate about what kind of assistance might be offered or how it would be provided before the team has completed its work.</PARA>
<PARA> The initiative, generally speaking, reflects the forward looking approach to relations with South Africa that Australia is now taking. This sort of cooperation is a very tangible way in which Australia can promote a democratic, non-racial and prosperous future for that country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the question is yes. After a somewhat protracted period of negotiation, ANSTO has entered into an agreement with Fujitsu Australia for the purpose of installing a supercomputer. It will be installed at Lucas Heights in mid-year and it will be the first supercomputer to commence operations in New South Wales. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation research scientists will reap the benefits in carrying forward their research and development projects and in expanding their capabilities in areas such as advance materials, environmental sciences and industrial technology, in each area of which ANSTO has become more involved with private sector industry in the last few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of projects that relate to those three areas will involve the use of the supercomputer. However, ANSTO will not be using the equipment to its full capacity, and it is proposed that the supercomputer will be connected to the Australian Academic Research Network, making it accessible to universities and research groups. The power available to scientists will significantly enhance Australia's industrial innovation and help our management abilities. The bureau to be established by ANSTO will be run as a joint venture with Fujitsu Australia. The joint venture is known as Australian supercomputing technology. The contract with Fujitsu will also enable ANSTO to act as a technology bridge between Australia and Japan for research and development projects to the value of $5m over five years-that is by arrangement with Fujitsu. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is currently arranging the sale, by tender, of the IBM mainframe which the supercomputer will replace.</PARA>

This estimate remains current.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to constant claims that the employment agreement negotiated at Power Brewing in Brisbane is a triumph for the kind of enterprise bargaining proposed by the Opposition? Do these claims suggest that the agreement was negotiated outside the Industrial Relations Commission and that, as a result of the agreement, Power Brewing employees have achieved spectacular increases in pay and productivity? Can the Minister advise whether or not these claims are correct? If they are not correct, can he advise what this suggests about the credibility of the people who are making them and therefore of the enterprise bargaining proposals they are putting forward?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Howard, in the Hansard reports of 15 October 1990 and 17 April 1990 and on the Lateline program on 11 April 1990, has made in essence three claims: that the Power Brewing agreement was achieved outside the Industrial Relations Commission and is therefore a model; that it resulted in an 85 per cent lift in the productivity of that company; and that workers have between $8,000 and $10,000 per annum more because of that productivity agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a fourth claim: that is, that Power Brewing has captured 20 per cent of the Queensland beer market in 3 1/2 years. I do not think anyone in the wildest of dreams would put that down to an enterprise agreement. To do so would be like saying that enterprise agreements can fix up foot and mouth disease, carbuncles and boils or a hole in the ozone layer. Market share is about taste, price and advertising, and I dismiss that claim from the list of claims.</PARA>
<PARA> The first claim, that the agreement was achieved outside the Industrial Relations Commission, is factually not true. The present award is an award of the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission. The original voluntary employment agreement, as it was called under the Bjelke-Petersen legislation, was required to be presented to the registrar of the Queensland Commission for approval, and it was. The present award is the brewing industry Power Brewing employees award. It was issued by the Queensland Commission, by Commissioner Edwards, on 24 April 1991. The first claim is factually incorrect, the allegation being made by Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA> The second claim, that the agreement resulted in an 85 per cent lift in productivity, is fraudulent. If it were true, by the way, there is no evidence that any employee of Power Brewing has received anything like any advantage out of such a dramatic lift. The company commenced its operations in December 1988 with new plant, new technology, and newly trained workers. The only way an 85 per cent comparison in productivity can be demonstrated over that time is by comparing the running-in phase, the trial phase, of the new plant, new technology and new workers to the full production phase of the plant. That would not be, in any sense, a reasonable comparison for older plants that did not start operation with those advantages. In fact, it is a fraudulent comparison, as I have said. No measurements have ever been produced to show a scientific basis for the 85 per cent claim that has been made.</PARA>
<PARA> The claim that there is a $8,000 to $10,000 payment more per worker is not true. Most workers employed at Power Brewing are at level 2 or level 1 of the award; that is, at the rate of $24,700 a year. That is comparable to the brewing industry award in Queensland of $21,330 a year. But Power Brewing workers work a 38-hour week compared with brewery workers, who work a 35-hour week. The hourly rate difference between both is a dollar an hour. But if all workers worked the same hours, a 38-hour week, then the difference between the take home pay of workers under the standard award and workers at Power Brewing is negligible.</PARA>
<PARA> The claim for an increase of $8,000 to $10,000 to Power Brewing workers can only be based on an assumption that all will reach level 7 of the award. That level is described as being payable to holders of degrees or diplomas in food technology or to people who are in senior management. The classification of level 7 does not appear in the general award, so there is no comparison of like with like. It would not even be an apples and oranges comparison; it is more like apples and kiwi fruit. It is just not a fair comparison to make.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government applauds workers and employers getting together and planning how strategically they can increase productivity to reduce price, increase wages and improve a profit sharing, I do not think the Power Brewing agreement in terms of what Mr Howard has said can be sustained at all. On the three fundamental issues, he is just plain wrong. It has been through the Commission; it has not resulted in that productivity improvement; workers do not receive those money amounts that he is claiming. His arithmetic preparation or arguments here are either sloppy or deceitful; it is one or the other. If this is the rock on which Liberal industrial relations policy is built, then that policy is demolished by virtue of the facts in this case and has no standing. But that is not surprising, given the fact that these are the words of someone who has been a suburban solicitor and a politician all his life and has never worked in industry.</PARA>

In fact, I concur with the remarks that I noted in today's press by the New South Wales Premier, Mr Greiner, who said that he was hoping there would be a decision certainly before the end of this year. The current situation, as Senator Brownhill knows, is that the EIS process is under way.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pause because I would like that interjection noted in Hansard. There is nothing complex, says Senator Parer, about the third runway. That clearly can only come from someone who has not even taken the interest to read the draft EIS, which throws up the many complex issues that are posed by the construction of the third runway. Among the thousands of submissions received, some 14,000 separate issues have been raised, all of which under the EIS process are required to be addressed. That is precisely the reason why the process is set up. The issues involve dredging, the bedrock on which the runway will be based, noise, air pollution, air traffic management and the alternative arrangements associated with Badgerys Creek. They are in every sense of the word complex issues. Those issues will be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I might add that the reason the Premier of New South Wales made such an informed and reasonable statement as he did about the runway-even in the context of the New South Wales election campaign-is that the Government of New South Wales is closely involved, both at political and departmental level, in the progression of the EIS process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What are the implications of the recent sale of the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank for employees of the State Bank of Victoria? In particular, has the Minister placed an embargo on the redeployment, redundancy and retrenchment agreement negotiated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association, the Australian Bank Employees Union and the Commonwealth Bank in December 1990, even though this agreement is inferior to redundancy pay rates available in the big private banks? Since it is argued by bank employee unions that an embargo is delaying the final pay-out to migrant liaison officers who have been in limbo since February and who have been under considerable stress and trauma, can the Minister advise when they will finally be able to get their lives in order? Finally, how does this retrenchment package compare with the average $100,000 per employee-which goes as high as $180,000 per annum-plus leave and superannuation which was given to waterfront workers in the Commonwealth Government's reform package?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth has not placed an embargo on the Commonwealth Bank. That is not an accurate description of what has happened. The facts of the case are that last year the Commonwealth Bank applied to me to propose to it a retrenchment package for redundancies arising out of the merger of the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria. Rather than me proposing a package for it, I asked the bank what it would propose to me as being a reasonable basis for redundancy. The Commonwealth Bank came forward with a package which I, in consultation with other senior Ministers in this Government, examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We recognised immediately that that package would have broken the Commonwealth standard redundancy provisions. However, we made a decision to allow the bank to go forward with that package and negotiate it with the unions on the basis that it did reflect standards in the private sector of banking and finance but that the package that it was proposing did not lead and was not the best, nor the worst, in the banking and finance sector. Because it was in the medium range we agreed to it and I issued to the Commonwealth Bank, as negotiating parameters, the package that it had asked for.</PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that the Commonwealth Bank exceeded those parameters in the negotiations and did not inform the Government that it had. We later discovered that it had exceeded those parameters. I have now had discussions with the Managing Director of the bank and with the relevant unions and I have told them that the Government will not vary its instructions and that the Commonwealth Bank is to renegotiate the agreement, in essence, because the bank, when it wished to exceed the instructions, did not come back to us and ask for new instructions; it just broke the arrangements that I had issued to it. That is not a situation that the Government will tolerate.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second part of the question Senator McLean asked about migrant liaison officers. The bank, by managerial decision at the merger, decided to make redundant 35 migrant liaison officers. That was a managerial decision, not a government decision. I have asked both the bank and the unions to give a high priority to settling the terms and conditions of their redundancy.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked finally whether the package meets the $100,000 employee pay-out for the waterfront workers. It does not meet the waterfront standard. The waterfront package is a package which is designed for, and applicable to, the unique characteristics of the waterfront. The bank package is a package which is designed for, and applicable to, the unique characteristics of the banking and finance industry. I might also say that the airlines package, which I have approved, is applicable to the airlines sector and the Telecom Australia package and the rail package are both applicable to their particular sectors.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has done here is to devolve more autonomy to government business enterprises to enable them to compete within the sectors in which they exist but on the basis that they do not leave those sectors with the best pay-outs, nor do they trail, but are in the middle range of those sectors. With that more relaxed coordination we expect that the particular deals that government business enterprises will reach reflect the sector in which they operate.</PARA>
<PARA> We will not be party to cross sector leapfrogging in which, because a deal for a government business enterprise is better in one sector than in another sector, the claim can be made that they are all government business enterprises and they should all observe the same standards. The requirement is that with the devolved responsibility they relate to their sector and we will resist any effort to try to pick the best standards out of the whole government area.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept the premises upon which this question is based. One of the variables that Senator Lewis has not included to arrive at his conclusions in this question is the level of participation rate. It is a fact that if the participation rate that we now enjoy-one of the record levels of participation rates in the Australian economy-were at the level suggested, unemployment would be much higher than it is now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that we have expanded and grown the economy and have got more people aged between 18 years and 65 years in the work force than ever before is one of the reasons that unemployment is as large as it is. Having said that, I must also say that in no way means that we do not take seriously the level of unemployment and the hardship it visits on people.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second part of Senator Lewis's question he asks about accord mark VI. What needs to be understood by the Opposition and, indeed, some independent commentators is that accord mark VI is in three parts. The first part is a $12 flat rate increase which is in exchange for a continuance and a bringing to conclusion of award restructuring, which is one of the great reforms that have occurred in industrial relations under this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the accord is to deregulate or to decentralise the wage fixing system to one based more upon an enterprise focus, something for which employers, unions and the Government asked the national wage case bench to issue guidelines. Those negotiations at that level are about sharing the advantage of achieved productivity and profitability.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, the accord direction is to lower unit labour costs and to achieve out of the greater productivity an increase in wages, an increase in profits and a reduced price to consumers for the good or service offered by a company. That is a positive way of fighting the difficulties of a recession and generating that productivity to claw our way out of the recession, and is not a negative factor.</PARA>
<PARA> The third area attends to the issue of superannuation, the options of which the Government is currently examining. That package as a whole is not a package that will generate more unemployment; it is a package that will generate growth and higher productivity in the economy and is thus a beneficial package for the economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Australia is the first country to implement the requirements of the latest international standard for bus roll-over strength. This will bring about significant strength in new bus and coach structures. The heavy vehicle design improvement package also includes the introduction of speed limiters for heavy buses and coaches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian design rule 6500 takes effect from July 1991. This design rule requires that heavy buses and heavy goods vehicles be fitted with speed limiting devices to limit their maximum speed to 100 kilometres per hour.</PARA>
<PARA> Other areas of activity in heavy vehicle standards are anti-lock braking and vehicle lighting. Work is advanced on proposals to extend anti-lock braking requirements and improve braking standards on all buses and coaches above 14.5 tonnes gross vehicle mass. The Australian design rule package for vehicle lighting comes into effect in October this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Crash investigations have revealed the need to examine further the issue of occupant restraint. The Minister for Land Transport has asked the Federal Office of Road Safety to investigate the feasibility of installing seat belts in all seating positions as a matter of urgency. The Vehicle Standards Advisory Committee has studied the technical implications of fitting three-point seat belts in all seating positions and a draft Australian design rule will be issued this month for public comment.</PARA>
<PARA> The bus and coach safety package shows the Federal Government's commitment to make bus and coach travel as safe as possible.

<PARA> The Federal Government is extremely concerned about the level of bicycle fatalities in Australia. Around 100 bike riders are killed in Australia each year and about 13 of these are under the age of 11 years. Included in the 10-point road safety package announced by the Prime Minister in December 1989 was the introduction of compulsory helmet wearing for bike riders. By 1 July this year nearly all States and Territories will have introduced compulsory helmet wearing laws for all bicycle riders. More than 80 per cent of all bike fatalities involve head injuries. This initiative should reduce the level of deaths and injuries significantly.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all that children of around the ages of 9 or 10 years or younger do not have the necessary skills to cope with traffic on the roads or to fully understand traffic laws.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. In light of the findings of the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, will the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs consider investigating and making recommendations to the Attorney-General and/or the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs on the operations of the independent public watchdog set up under legislation in New Zealand for investigating complaints against police known as the Police Complaints Authority? Does the Minister agree that such a statutory agency set up by Parliament and independent of police would greatly increase community confidence and, more importantly, Aboriginal confidence in the operations of the various State police forces, as the final report of the Commission found that the custodial and corrections systems actively oppress and injure Aboriginal people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided me with the following information. The Government has noted that the Royal Commission's recommendation No. 226 was to the effect that all jurisdictions needed to review urgently the processes for dealing with complaints against the police and that one key aspect of the recommendation was that the review body should be totally independent of the police force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It needs to be made clear at the outset that the Commonwealth can legislate only for the Australian Federal Police, including arrangements for handling complaints against that force. The Commonwealth has no control over the operation of State police forces. The Commonwealth has already legislated to provide a comprehensive review mechanism which gives the Commonwealth Ombudsman an independent monitoring role. The provisions of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 seem to give the Ombudsman a role comparable to that given to the Police Complaints Authority in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure Senator Vallentine that the provisions of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 will be reviewed in the light of the Royal Commission's recommendations. Furthermore, the Commonwealth will be ensuring, through the joint ministerial forum which will be meeting to consider the final report of the Royal Commission and also through the Australian Police Ministers Council, that this recommendation relating to the handling of complaints against police forces will also be considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. The Minister may recall that his colleague the honourable member for Shortland, Mr Peter Morris, in a speech recently in the House of Representatives agreed with me that there would appear to be a question mark over the persistence of the Royal Australian Navy with the Krupp sonar system that was being fitted to the minehunters begun by Carrington Slipways in Newcastle in 1983.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We went over this in some detail, but not immense detail, in the Estimates hearings. The minehunter program has been running since 1975. There is no question that there have been a number of setbacks in its development. I guess that that is part of the risk that is taken when one goes for an innovative design rather than a proven design. I can point to examples of success in the defence forces and examples of failure. Certainly, the sonar problems of two or three years ago were a major setback for the Navy, which it admits. It is now addressing that by trialing two separate systems. This question will be addressed in a full structural review, and I will not reveal any further Government attitude to that until I make that statement here in Parliament in the period from 4 June to 6 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes, I would agree with Mr Morris's comments on this issue. The sonar system has not been a major success story in the defence area. I would be happy-but I do not want to waste the time of the Senate-to point out many of the success stories, but there are failures, and that is one of them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, President Bush announced some quite major changes in the United States policy toward the negotiations in Geneva on the chemical weapons convention. The principal changes announced included: that the negotiators should set a target of the end of 1991 to resolve the outstanding issues in the negotiations with a view to final completion of the treaty by this time next year; secondly, that the US would forswear the use of chemical weapons by way of retaliation against any country for any reason once the convention is in force; thirdly, that the US would provide an unconditional assurance to destroy all its chemical weapons stocks and production facilities within 10 years of the treaty's entry into force and not retain any stockpile of its own; and finally, that the United States would intend to become an original signatory to the convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia very warmly welcomes these new elements in the US policy toward the convention. We fully share the objective of concluding the negotiations as soon as possible. We believe that the changes announced are important. We have been encouraging the United States in these various directions for some time. The US announcement should provide a significant impetus to concluding the negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> We intend to continue taking a leading role in those multilateral negotiations in Geneva. The prospects for early finalisation of the treaty have been enhanced by the announcement in Washington yesterday. We believe that it would be desirable to hold a ministerial meeting of the conference on disarmament, this year if possible, aimed at resolving the remaining difficult issues which still require a political input. The US announcement does clear a good deal of the remaining ground and, in doing so, sharpens the focus on the remaining issues and it reinforces, in our judgment, the desirability of there being such a meeting.</PARA>

In respect of one of those questions during the course of Question Time today my office received a faxed copy of answers, together with a covering letter, which indicates that the Minister responsible, Mr Baldwin, received the information three weeks ago, on 16 April 1991. The answer has therefore been left lying in that Minister's office for that period of time, despite the fact that even when it was received it was out of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I therefore wish to draw to the attention of the Senate a matter which I regard as being very serious. I do not hold Senator Bolkus personally responsible for the matter because he is acting in an agency capacity.

<PARA> I have not yet received the other answer. However, I understand informally from Senator Bolkus that I can expect to receive it today. On that basis I do not propose to move any further motion. But I want to make it plain that I believe all honourable senators would take the view that if we experience another episode such as this, where answers are simply left to lie in a Minister's office, despite there being a command of this chamber, then we ought to take a very dim view indeed and perhaps take further action the next time around.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Today I table a report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled, Aboriginal Development Commission-Legal costs in relation to Senate privileges matter. This matter was referred to the Committee in November 1989. A motion was moved during the committee stage of debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989. It was moved as a result of an answer provided by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) to a question asked during the examination of the 1989-90 Budget Estimates by Senate Estimates Committee E. The answer disclosed that the ADC had paid more than $160,000 for legal representation of itself and various other parties involved in an inquiry by the Senate Committee of Privileges. The terms of reference required the Committee to investigate the level of and justification for these legal expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry was concerned with the fees charged by lawyers representing members of the ADC and various other parties. They were represented before the Senate Committee of Privileges by lawyers of considerable standing, and it is to be expected that the charges made by them would be substantial. The Committee agrees that people should be properly represented before the Senate and bodies of the Senate. Proper representation includes senior counsel, eminent juniors and outstanding solicitors. The Committee understands that these must be paid for. However, it is appropriate for the Senate to scrutinise the fees paid to professional people preparing cases brought before it and its committees and appearing before those bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has the power to regulate its own proceedings and those of its committees. This includes the inherent power to scrutinise the fees charged by professionals who prepare the cases of and appear for the people before its committees. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case it had a further responsibility. The people involved in the inquiry of the Senate Committee of Privileges had lawyers who were paid for by the Aboriginal Development Commission. This is a body funded from Consolidated Revenue. Accordingly, it was proper for the Senate to examine how the funds were spent. The Committee sought the advice of a legal cost consultant in preparing this report. Given the nature of the task that the Committee was required to undertake, it felt that it was incumbent upon it to consider expert advice to enable it to report to the Senate. The Committees's findings are set out in the report at page (ix). In addition to these findings, the Committee has recommended that a Commonwealth agency seeking to engage legal representation from the private sector require a detailed bill of costs as a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA> Both in this inquiry and in the Committee's larger inquiry into the costs of legal services and litigation, the Committee has been made aware of problems associated with lawyers' abbreviated bills of cost. A detailed bill would assist agencies which are spending taxpayers' moneys in meeting their obligations and ensuring that the expenditure of that money is properly accounted for. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a couple of brief comments and then I will seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks in Hansard. Very briefly, the Public Works Committee showed some concern as to the fact that the Customs facility was almost an absolute carbon copy of the facility being built for the Australian Taxation Office right alongside. It should be noted that there was a proposal to build a computer facility to be shared by at least four departments and, until some time in 1990, Customs and the Australian Taxation Office planned to share a facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Because Customs fell behind with its approval process, the two facilities ended up being side by side, and things such as power had to be shared separately. The Committee was very concerned about this and, in the report, we called on the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) to conduct a review of all Commonwealth departments and authorities to ensure that, as far as practicable, facilities such as computer installations are collocated. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my remarks in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Tuesday 14 May 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The report I have just tabled proposes the construction of a two storey structure of approximately 3780 square metres gross floor area which will provide 1425 square metres of computer floor area and associated office space, staff amenities, loading dock, storage and plant rooms. The limit-of-cost estimate for the project is $16.9m at November 1990 prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has approved this project, but with reservations which relate principally to:</PARA>
<PARA>* the location of the proposed building on a site next to a similar facility being built for the Australian Taxation Office; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the arrangements for the power supply to the building. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee received a considerable amount of material dealing with the proposed location of the Customs building next to the Taxation Office building which is currently under construction. </PARA>
<PARA>Evidence was given that since 1985 there had been attempts to build a computer facility to be shared by three or four departments. Until sometime in 1990, Customs and Tax were planning a shared facility; only when Customs fell behind in the approval process did the two facilities side by side become inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA>We accept that it is now too late to delay either project; we also accept evidence that amalgamation of both facilities would incur significant costs. On the other hand, we are of the view that substantial overall savings could have been made if both facilities had been in the same building from the earliest planning stage. Accordingly, we have recommended that the Minister for Administrative Services should conduct a review of all Commonwealth departments and authorities to ensure that, as far as practicable, facilities such as computer installations are collocated. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe this review is very important and should be undertaken as a matter of urgency because of the sums of money which could be involved. It is also important because of the long term and rational development of Commonwealth facilities which would result from it. </PARA>
<PARA>While at one time neither Customs nor Tax appeared to have any problems about sharing a facility, at a later stage in the planning process concerns were expressed about having them in the same building, because of the risks of industrial disputation or sabotage. The Committee found this an intriguing situation and believed it was an excellent example of a two way bet which could not be sustained. If the two facilities were at risk in the same building, we are at a loss to understand how that risk is reduced by having them in separate buildings on adjacent sites. </PARA>
<PARA>In our Sixth Report of 1990, dealing with the Taxation Office's computer centre, the Committee drew attention to the power supply arrangements for that building. In particular, we questioned the need for two independent high voltage supplies and asked that this be reviewed, because of the provision of other substantial backup facilities. The Committee was never informed whether there was a review or not. </PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry into this reference revealed the same independent power supply arrangement was required with similar backup arrangements. While we accept there must be backup arrangements, we are not convinced of the need for a double power supply. We also accept that this is a requirement of the supplying authority, not an additional item included by Customs. The Committee has therefore recommended that Customs and Australian Construction Services take up with the ACT Electricity and Water Authority its insistence that two independent power supplies be provided to computer installations. </PARA>
<PARA>I would now like briefly to consider some of the other issues which came up during this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>After the project was referred to the Committee, we became aware that the Joint Committee on the ACT was conducting an inquiry into proposals for the transport system to service a new part of Canberra, Gungahlin. One of the components of that system which was causing community concern was the route of a proposed major north/south road, John Dedman Parkway. This route could have been very close to the site proposed for the Customs building. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee took evidence from the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the ACT Committee. I should mention, Mr Speaker, that it is quite unusual for one committee to ask members of another committee to give evidence. It was also perhaps unusual that they were so keen to appear before us. The Honourable Member for Fraser and Senator Margaret Reid did appear before us and, on behalf of the members of the PWC, I would like to thank them for their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of our concerns, the planners at the national and the local level got together and produced an alignment which would not compromise the Customs site. The planners gave evidence that this proposed westerly alignment would meet their needs if, in fact, it was ever built. The Committee also received evidence that, provided appropriate precautions were taken, construction of the Parkway would not endanger either the Customs or Taxation buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>This Committee can only report to the Parliament on the reference it has received. It will be for the Joint Committee on the ACT to make a recommendation on the route for the John Dedman Parkway. The Australian Sports Commission forwarded two submissions which set out its concerns, principally reductions in car parking spaces and worsened access to this part of Bruce, if the Parkway was to be built on the westerly route. These are issues more appropriately dealt with by the Joint Committee on the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would like to acknowledge the contribution of community groups such as the North Canberra Protection Group. Its concerns with another possible route of the Parkway led to the delineation of this westerly option. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee received a detailed submission from the Windass Hanmer Partnership in Sydney. This submission argued that the proposed Customs building was too expensive for what was needed and over-specified in many details. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee sought additional information from Customs, Australian Construction Services and the Tax Office on the issues it raised in that submission. The Committee concluded that the Windass Hanmer Partnership was not able to sustain its views. During this inquiry, issues of some significance to the approval process for Commonwealth facilities were raised. It is our hope that the Minister's review will mean that comparable facilities are not duplicated as unnecessarily as were these two. To ensure this does not happen, planning and approval processes need to be more effectively coordinated between departments and authorities. If this is done, the Committee's endeavours in this reference will have been justified. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY (JOB SEARCH AND NEWSTART) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would implement one of the most significant changes to the Australian system of social security since the 1940s. </PARA>
<PARA>It involves the end of the unemployment benefit program-a program which was created in a world very different from today's. It will see the introduction of a new strategy-the Newstart program-which will help us deal far more effectively with the pressing problems of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I do not need to remind members of the urgent need for a program such as this at this time. We must not repeat the mistakes of 1982-83. Those who lost their jobs at that time were largely ignored. As a result, enormous damage was done to their skills and motivation and serious problems of poverty were created. When the recovery came, long term unemployment remained a serious problem that has taken many years of Government effort to tackle. </PARA>
<PARA>The major changes which are introduced in this Bill build on the successful reforms of recent years which have received widespread community support and produced far more effective outcomes for the unemployed. The job search allowance for youth and the initial NEWSTART program for the long term unemployed have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of positive measures of assistance; and form the foundation for our new approach. </PARA>
<PARA>The Newstart program provided for in this Bill is a wide ranging strategy. It centres on the creation of two new payments-job search allowance and newstart allowance-which in turn involve new patterns of obligation, greater emphasis on training, increased responsibility for the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), and improved CES/DSS liaison. </PARA>
<PARA>Newstart is a major step forward in the integration of income support with labour market assistance. We recognise that it is simply not enough in these difficult times to provide people with income support and leave them to their own job search. We have to find out why people are having difficulty in finding work. We have to think about their prospects, not just immediately, but in the longer term. We then have to make serious attempts at dealing with their needs through training and other programs. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the keys to the success of this strategy, Mr President, therefore, is the availability of labour market programs. The Government has substantially increased the availability of these programs for the long term unemployed in recent years. As part of the Newstart program, an additional $227 million is to be provided for labour market programs until the end of 1993-94, giving over 50,000 additional program places each year. This increase will be supplemented by the $105 million expansion of labour market programs announced in the Prime Minister's March 1991 Industry Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>With the Newstart Program, we will not be repeating the disastrous social and economic policy of 1982-83. We will be working with unemployed Australians in the most effective way possible to ensure that they will share in the benefits of economic recovery. More than that, we will be working to improve the competitiveness of the Australian economy and its labour force. The Newstart Program integrates social and economic goals in a way which will build on Australia's proud reputation as an international leader in social policy. </PARA>
<PARA>In developing the arrangements for Job Search Allowance, a major aim is to help prevent long term unemployment wherever possible-to deal with problems before they become entrenched. Recipients will be required to participate in a labour market program or vocational training if this is likely to improve their chances of finding a job. The CES will provide early intervention assistance to job search allowance recipients within the first three months where it is needed. There will remain a strong focus on helping young people, and the current arrangements for 16 and 17 year olds will be incorporated into the Job Search Allowance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides that Job Search allowees, like Newstart allowees, who start CES-approved training will continue to receive their job search payment together with the normal training allowances. Improving skills should be seen as an integral part of effective job search, particularly in the current economic situation. The change will help resolve some problems of interruption of income support that people have experienced under current arrangements when transferring from unemployment benefit to a training allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>When unemployment benefit was first introduced, and indeed for most of the first thirty years of its operation, long term unemployment was largely unknown. For the last ten years, however, it has been a major community problem. The introduction of Newstart Allowance for the long term unemployed will enable us to meet this problem in the specialised way that is needed. </PARA>
<PARA>Experience has shown that the key to tackling successfully the problems of the longer term unemployed lies in integration of income support and other forms of assistance. Since the Government upgraded efforts in this area, with the first phase of the Newstart program, the results have been striking. NEWSTART has also shown that concentrated efforts, utilising options from a range of available measures, to assist the long term unemployed can contribute to useful employment outcomes, even for persons in receipt of UB for 5 years or more. No country has found this problem easy to deal with but the figures show that significant numbers of people can be helped. </PARA>
<PARA>Between February 1989 and December 1990, 134,000 persons in the NEWSTART target group left unemployment benefit. During this time, around 75,000 unemployment benefit recipients have participated in labour market programs which will improve their employment prospects. The proportion of the unemployed who are long term fell from around 38% in February 1989 to 25% in November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the arrangements for Newstart Allowance, therefore, the CES will have greatly increased responsibility for the long term unemployed. Willingness to undertake training or take advantage of other program assistance will be a major condition of income support. The CES will, under delegation, administer the activity test for Newstart allowees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Newstart Program will see assistance and requirements tailored far more closely to individual needs and capacities. A key feature of the Newstart Allowance will be the Activity Agreement that recipients will have to enter into to receive the Allowance. In each case, the Activity Agreement will set out the steps that individuals will have to take to improve their employment prospects. There should be no misunderstanding about this. The Activity Agreement will be a requirement for payment. If a person is not prepared to enter into, and abide by, an Agreement they will not be paid Newstart Allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this is an initiative very much aimed at providing real hope and assistance to people. It offers scope to people to acquire skills so that they will be better placed when the labour market starts to improve. I should stress, however, that the Government is strongly of the view that acceptance by the community of increased obligation to help the unemployed must be accompanied by increased reciprocal obligations for the unemployed to take advantage of the Assistance available and so help themselves. Recipients of either Allowance who unreasonably refuse offers of assistance or make insufficient efforts themselves will have their payments suspended for a period, or cancelled. Job Search Allowance for those over 18 will be available for no more than twelve months. Transfer to Newstart Allowance is not automatic. These are firm signals that income support will be payable only where recipients' obligations are met. </PARA>
<PARA>The interests of the community will also be protected by continuation of the measures introduced by the Government in recent years within the Department of Social Security to reduce the risk of fraud and incorrect payment. The Department will maintain its efforts in this area through its program of interviews and reviews, computer data matching, mobile review teams and other strategies. Those receiving Job Search Allowance and Newstart Allowance will have to lodge a form in person each fortnight to continue payment. Compliance will be enhanced by significantly improved liaison arrangements with the CES and the increased contact with individuals that is an essential feature of the Newstart Program. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Newstart Program was announced in the February 1990 Economic Statement, it was estimated that the program would be a minor net cost to the Commonwealth in 1990-91 ($0.4m) with net savings of around $12.13m accruing in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The announcement of new labour market programs in the March 1991 Industry Statement and substantial changes to the UB parameters since early 1990 will change the overall cost savings of the program from the February 1990 estimates. However, net program savings are still anticipated from 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>There are those who would wish to deal with the problems of unemployment in a simplistic and socially and economically irresponsible way-by, for example, providing little or no program assistance and terminating benefits after a period regardless of whether a person has genuinely been able to find work. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government, however, has no intention of making scapegoats of the unemployed. The necessary measures to require reciprocal obligation on the part of the unemployed and to maintain the integrity of the system should be seen in the contest of the positive assistance and encouragement which will be provided. The Newstart Program is intended to address the real problems of the unemployed and work in their interest and that of the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill would also incorporate initiatives introduced during the Budget Sittings 1990 that would impact on the payability of Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance or the rate of payment at which a person is to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the social security legislation to implement some relatively minor initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Social Security Act 1947 provides an assets test exemption for certain pre-paid funeral expenses. Generally, this involves a person entering into a contract with a funeral director where he or she pays over money and the funeral director agrees to provide a funeral service at some future time. However, some investment companies now offer funeral bonds. These allow people to set aside money for the payment of funeral expenses without necessarily committing themselves to a particular funeral director. Income accrues to such bonds. This Bill introduces an exemption from the income and assets tests for these bonds provided that the bond has a contribution limit of $5,000 or less per funeral and cannot be redeemed before maturity on the death of the investor or the investor's spouse. A person will not be able to benefit from both the exemption for funeral bonds and the existing exemption for pre-paid funeral expenses. </PARA>
<PARA>The definition of `income' in the Act at present does not exclude certain scholarship payments. As a result, a person could have a social security payment cancelled or reduced under the income test on receiving a scholarship payment. The Government has decided that, with effect from 1 September 1990, a scholarship awarded from outside Australia to a person is to be excluded from the person's income if the payment does not include any component for living expenses and if the Minister approves the scholarship payment for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>A recent decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria has cast some doubt on whether existing provisions of the Social Security Act enable the Commonwealth to recover social security payments from compensation payments where State or Territory legislation purports to make such compensation payments inalienable. This Bill makes it clear that the Commonwealth can recover social security payments in spite of such provisions in State or Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also makes some minor technical amendments to refine and clarify measures introduced in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Bill is one of several social security bills to be introduced during the current Sittings. Other bills will provide for the transition from the Social Security Act 1947 to the clear English Social Security Act 1991 and update the Social Security Act 1991 to take account of social security initiatives introduced in legislation during the Budget Sittings last year or in this Bill and provide for the implementation of initiatives announced in the 1990/91 Budget such as the NEWSTART strategy and disability reform. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY (REWRITE) TRANSITION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will provide for the transition from the Social Security Act 1947 (the 1947 Act) to the Social Security Act 1991 (the 1991 Act). </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will achieve four specific objectives. It will:</PARA>
<PARA>* repeal the 1947 Act;</PARA>
<PARA>* provide for the transition from the 1947 Act to the 1991 Act;</PARA>
<PARA>* consolidate all applicable savings provisions; and</PARA>
<PARA>* make consequential amendments to other Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>The overall aim of this Bill will be to achieve an uncomplicated transition so that the general administration of pensions, benefits and allowances will continue as normal under the legislative scheme of the 1991 Act. Social security recipients will not be disadvantaged by the transition. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will provide that where persons are receiving a pension, benefit or allowance they will continue to do so without having to lodge a new claim form. It will provide arrangements for the treatment of claims and reviews which had not been determined before the repeal of the 1947 Act. It will also provide for other administrative matters such as the continuity of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and its members. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill does not have any financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUPPLY (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1991-92</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing requirements of the Parliamentary Departments during the period 1 July 1991 to 30 November 1991. They total some $51.6 million which is $4.9 million, or 10.5 per cent, greater than the amount provided for in the supply period 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SUPPLY BILL (NO 2) 1991-92</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill seeks interim appropriations, totalling some $3,440 million, for expenditure on capital works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and certain other services for the period 1 July 1991 to 30 November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The amount sought is $500 million, or about 17.1 per cent, more than that provided in the Supply Act (No 2) 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Of this figure only about $50 million is as a consequence of new initiatives not previously included in the annual Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>The residual flows largely from lumpy payments associated with existing programs which have previously been approved by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Major increases in existing subdivisions include:</PARA>
<PARA>Administrative Services</PARA>
<PARA>- $54 million for payment to the Department of Administrative Services common service trust accounts to fund approved acquisition programs and to provide additional working capital as these agencies move to a more commercial operating base. </PARA>
<PARA>Primary Industries and Energy</PARA>
<PARA>- $47 million for payments to or for the States and Territories principally as a result of payments to Victoria in lieu of royalties following revised petroleum taxation arrangements. This increase has been partially offset by variations in the timing of other payments to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Treasury</PARA>
<PARA>- $108 million for payments to the States and Territories largely as assistance for debt redemption. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of new provisions which reflect new Government initiatives, these have been separately itemised in the Bill, in accordance with longstanding convention, and include:</PARA>
<PARA>Attorney-General's</PARA>
<PARA>- $5.9 million for advances, establishment grants, payments and operating subsidy for the AUSCRIPT-Commonwealth Reporting Service Trust Account as the Commonwealth Reporting Service is moving to a trust account as part of its commercialisation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment, Education and Training</PARA>
<PARA>- $14.6 million for the Work Experience Program with training</PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Relations</PARA>
<PARA>- $3.9 million for the Australian Best Practice Demonstration Program announced in the Economic Development Statement</PARA>
<PARA>Treasury</PARA>
<PARA>- $14.0 million for payment to Tasmania as compensation consequent upon the Tasmanian Banks merger. </PARA>
<PARA>As indicated with regard to the Supply Bill (No 1), the provisions in this Bill do not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1991-92 Budget context. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Training Guarantee requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training, broadly defined. It was established by legislation introduced into this House almost twelve months ago, and it came into effect on 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The scheme was introduced by the Government in recognition of the pressing need for more and better quality training in Australia, to equip us with the highly skilled and flexible workforce we urgently need in order to compete in the international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA>The Training Guarantee is a carefully constructed measure aimed at improving the training effort of businesses which did not, before its introduction, invest in training, or invested very little. Firms which already recognise the value of training and train above the required minimum level are affected very little. </PARA>
<PARA>An important objective of the Training Guarantee is to change industry attitudes towards training. For too long, many firms have regarded training as a cost to be minimised rather than as an investment from which they can expect measurable returns. Even firms which train their staff in times of economic buoyancy are inclined to jettison their training effort first, in times of economic downturn. </PARA>
<PARA>The Training Guarantee is designed to make our nation's training effort stronger-both in terms of quantity and quality-more equitable-so that ``good'' trainers are not disadvantaged by having their trained staff poached by ``bad'' trainers-and more consistent-so that at least a minimum amount of training is undertaken every year, and that economic recovery is not jeopardised by skill shortages. </PARA>
<PARA>The Training Guarantee has only been in force since 1 July 1990, so it is too early to make conclusive statements about the changes it has wrought in practice or attitude. The ABS Training Expenditure Survey, which is due to be released later this month, will provide the first conclusive data on changes in employer expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>A quarterly survey conducted in NSW however, by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the State Bank, indicates that 45% of employers surveyed had increased their training expenditure in the September 1990 quarter, and that more than 90% had training plans in place. </PARA>
<PARA>Anecdotal evidence also indicates that there is a much greater level of interest in training among the business community than has been the case in the past. Certainly the Minister's office and the Department have received many enquires about the Scheme, and great interest has been shown in the registered industry training agent concept. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 to give effect to undertakings made by the Government in relation to outstanding trainers and to fees charged by industry training agents. It clarifies the intentions of the original legislation in several regards and makes some minor technical amendments to the provisions. It also makes provision for the recognition of alternative training levy schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>During the Second Reading Speech on the original Training Guarantee legislation, mention was made of the useful contribution during the process of consultation and development by the Australian Democrats, particularly their suggestions in relation to registered industry training agents and to the possibility of exemptions from the provisions of the Act for employers who are outstanding trainers. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will enable the establishment of a system to exempt outstanding trainers from the provisions of the Act. It provides that Regulations may be made which allow the Minister, among other things, to establish criteria against which the training effort of applicant employers may be measured, in order to award them outstanding trainer status. </PARA>
<PARA>The recognition of outstanding trainers will be a positive acknowledgment that some employers are committed to training and well exceed the minimum requirements of the Act. At the same time, it provides an incentive for other employers to achieve this status. </PARA>
<PARA>The criteria, to be set by Regulation, have been the subject of consultation with employer representatives and unions. Honourable Senators may recall that the Prime Minister announced, in his 12 March Economic Statement, that in order to achieve outstanding trainer status, and to qualify for exemption from the provisions of the Training Guarantee Act, employers will need to spend at least 5% of payroll on quality structured training. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of a system of Registered Industry Training Agents (now known as RITAs) was provided for in the original Training Guarantee (Administration) Act. This Bill makes some amendments to the way the system operates, on the basis of suggestions made to the Government by the National Training Board, by industry and, indeed, by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA>For example, the Bill allows RITAs and the training advisory body to charge fees on application for a certificate rather than, as in the original legislation, only when a certificate is issued. This amendment allows RITAs to charge a fee to recover their costs when a training program is assessed and found to be not an eligible training program, and a certificate is refused. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill clarifies the status of RITAs while they are performing services for employers and issuing training advisory certificates. The Bill states that both RITAs and the training advisory body are, in this context, not agents of the Commonwealth. The provisions ensure that those bodies may charge fees in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional flexibility has been provided in fee-setting to allow RITAs to set fees according to circumstances. Rather than providing for a fixed amount, the Bill allows fees to be set on a sliding scale up to a maximum of $500. That maximum amount is automatically indexed. A provision has also been inserted which allows the training advisory body to deregister a RITA which overcharges. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill makes absolutely clear that RITAs are covered by the existing secrecy provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill introduces two changes to the wording of the section which deals with the definition of ``eligible training programs''. </PARA>
<PARA>The first specifies that training programs which are not designed by a person with appropriate qualifications must be approved by such a person, in advance of their delivery. This was, in fact, the intention of the original legislation but was not specifically stated. </PARA>
<PARA>The second tightens the clause on objects of training programs and, in effect, ensures that an eligible training program has no significant object which is not training related. At the same time, the amendment ensures that structured on the job training with an unavoidable production element, which is otherwise eligible, will still be eligible training. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill widens the definition of related companies who may elect to group, for Training Guarantee purposes, and to be treated as a single employer. Such an election has advantages in terms of record keeping and reporting, and this amendment will benefit certain corporations such as Commonwealth and State instrumentalities which were previously prevented from participating. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill inserts provisions into the Act which restate the situation in relation to partnerships, unincorporated associations and trusts, to make clear on whom obligations fall, and by whom they may be discharged. New provisions relating to offences have been included which ensure that action can be easily taken in the event of a failure to fulfil obligations. It is also made clear that obligations are determined on a partnership by partnership, association by association or trust by trust basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides the basis for alternative training levy schemes to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA>Some industries or industry sectors have expressed interest in implementing their own training levy schemes as an alternative to the Training Guarantee. The Minister has, in fact, indicated his willingness to consider such approaches on the basis of a number of conditions, not the least of which is the amount of money which will, as a result of such an alternative scheme, be spent on eligible training. </PARA>
<PARA>It is possible for an industry to be exempted from the provisions of the Training Guarantee, under existing legislation. This amendment, however, provides a more flexible basis for the regulation of such schemes, for the benefit of industries which prefer to be responsible for their own training needs. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary then, this Bill introduces some new aspects to the Training Guarantee in response to good ideas and suggestions which the Government has received since the Scheme's inception. </PARA>
<PARA>It also makes some amendments to current provisions to facilitate the administration of the Training Guarantee and to ensure that it achieves its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are continuing the debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91, which we commenced on 9 May 1991. During the course of the debate I spoke about the disgusting performance of now ex-Ambassador Burke and of the inactivity of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans)-who, coincidentally, is at the table now-in dismissing Mr Burke. I think it is rather sad because the inactivity of the Government has continued to create a problem for Australia generally, and it has certainly continued to create a problem in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the Minister talks about an obsession. If anyone is obsessed by this issue, it is the Minister himself and his inglorious Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who have relentlessly defended their little mate, their little crony, Mr Burke. Australia's reputation did not matter one iota in this whole issue. Even Mr Burke, on either of his resignations, did not have the decency to talk about Australia's interest in this matter, but simply about the Federal Labor Government, and that it was in the interests of the Federal Labor Government that he should resign. Not once did he mention anything about the interests of Australia's representation and the integrity of the position of ambassador.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Gareth Evans can give me an example of where Mr Burke has mentioned anything about that in either of his resignations, I would be more than interested to see it, because on not one occasion has he mentioned it at all. All he is worried about is the Minister's grubby little reputation in the Government in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, he did not think about the reputation of Western Australia when he acted in the way in which he did while he was Premier of Western Australia-a disgraceful performance that will ooze out more and more detail over the next 18 months about the conduct of his Government, his Ministers and his mates. It is a sad reflection on the Minister and the Prime Minister that cronyism was far ahead of that of the interest of Australia. I come back to some of the things that the Minister was involved in. Late last year he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if some evidence emerges through the courts or elsewhere which would make it inappropriate for the ambassadorial position to be maintained, then I will act, but not sooner. </PARA>
<PARA>Evidence did come out, but no, you became the master in shifting the goalposts. Every day, every week you shifted the goalposts, you changed the rules. You moved those goalposts on 13 March when you said that allegations in the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters must be supported by evidence and that you would await the outcome of the Commission, which indeed was unlikely to emerge prior to the conclusion of Mr Burke's term in 1992. Heaven only knows what appeared in the first three weeks of the Royal Commission, to say nothing of what happened the moment Mr Burke himself took the stand. But even then you said that that was insufficient information. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise, Madam Acting Deputy President. It is very sad that the Minister kept on moving those goalposts, because when Mr Burke, under oath, gave evidence that he knowingly avoided paying tax on accounts over which he had sole responsibility, even that was not seen to be an improper act for which Mr Burke could be dismissed. In fact, Senator Evans just said that it was Mr Burke's state of mind. I am not too sure whether the Minister meant that Mr Burke was going troppo or whether he was saying, `If you do not think you have to pay tax, then that is all right'. I contend that, if any one of us thought we did not have to pay tax but subsequently found that we did, the Australian Taxation Office would not just say, `Oh, well, if you didn't think you had to pay tax, that's okay. We don't mind'. I am sure Tax Office officials would come and knock on our doors and make us pay the tax that we should otherwise have paid, and in addition we would be fined. But no, Senator Evans, in his official capacity as the boss of this person, decides that that is not an improper act either. In justifying his refusal to require Mr Burke to stand down while appearing before the Commission, the Minister even had the gall last month to claim that the Irish Government would understand `the political realities of situations like this' because of its `robust political tradition'. How offensive to the Irish to imply that they would accept anybody or anything.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least the Holy See was spared a similar cynical comment, and I suppose that is the only highlight to that. Senator Evans has just said that that is not what he said. I have just quoted verbatim from Hansard as to what he said. If the Minister wants to go around doing a Senator Cook and changing Hansard, he may as well let us know that, too. We thought Senator Cook was the only good one at doing that. Yet on Sunday 28 April the Minister cited increased awareness of the Commission hearings in Ireland together with Mr Burke's ability to do the job when so preoccupied as the reason for finally reviewing the position-reviewing but still not acting. Even though the Minister was forced to admit that Mr Burke was preoccupied-and we all know from his telephone bills he was pretty well preoccupied-the Minister still did not have the courage to dismiss him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within the Hawke Labor Government concerns for the integrity of ambassadorial representation were thrown out of the window in favour of the fine old tradition of Labor cronyism. Why is it that Labor mates must be allowed to decide whether they should stand down and be defended when they tough it out? If they decide to resign it must be on the most favourable terms possible to the mate and no consideration is given to the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> What we must remember of course is that Mr Burke has been paid by the taxpayer since 1988 to do a job in Ireland. Yet what has clearly come out of the Royal Commission-and obviously more is yet to come out-is the fact that while the taxpayers have been paying Mr Burke to do a job as an ambassador he has been running the Australian Labor Party from afar. Not only do his telephone bills indicate that, but also, in a factual sense, he has admitted, as have others, on oath before the Royal Commission, that he was operating accounts and dishing out money to Labor Party candidates while he was ambassador. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the correct use of taxpayers' money and I would be awfully surprised if the Minister were to condone it. But quite clearly he has; by his inactivity and his unpreparedness to act concerning Mr Burke he has condoned that type of action. What I find is probably the most sad thing of all in this whole sorry saga is the reflection that the Minister has cast upon professional diplomats and even some of the other political appointees by saying that he will now revise the whole procedure, criteria and method of operation of ambassadors just because one ambassador has done something wrong-not one thing wrong, but has committed a multitude of offences. So all career diplomats will now be put under scrutiny and have their rules changed because of Mr Burke's conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor mates might be asked to resign when they are silly enough to go public, as Mr Burke did on 27 April when he gave the game away by saying that if he were not a Labor mate he would have been ditched `years ago'. Once again, there was no definite action, just a nudge and a clip under the ear to signify that things like that should not be said publicly. What Mr Burke said at that stage-that he would have been ditched `years ago' had he not been a Labor mate-was exactly the same thing as Mr Alan Renouf, a former professional diplomat, had said weeks earlier. The Minister had refuted that. In answer to my question to him in this very chamber the Minister said that he disagreed with what Mr Renouf had said. The Minister might have disagreed with what Mr Renouf had said, but Mr Burke did not-he agreed that he would have been pelted out had he not been a mate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, what is even more sad for the taxpayer is what Mr Burke gets as a consequence. It does little for the tattered credibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade for him not to have stood Mr Burke aside when it first became obvious that Mr Burke's conduct was not befitting the high office of ambassador; or at least when Mr Burke's own evidence to the Royal Commission confirmed all the suspicions. But the philosophy of Labor cronyism was cynically and characteristically expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who said that if Mr Burke had not spoken out publicly and `put his foot in it' he would have saved his job. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is, a Labor mate has pocketed three months salary for no work and gained a $28,000 severance payment on top of his free telephone calls, despite having resigned the first time rather than being sacked-but no doubt that was a protection against an unsympathetic coalition government when the contract was drawn up. The Government has still not explained why Mr Burke has been given this ex-gratia payment as though he had been sacked. That is going back to before his second resignation and before his sacking. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a situation where Mr Burke has been given $28,000 for acting improperly as an ambassador and another $7,500 for being sacked because he acted improperly as an ambassador. We now have the situation where, because Mr Burke has now returned to Perth before the expiry of his ex-Premier entitlements on 1 June 1991, the taxpayers are footing the cost of a car for six months, a driver for six months and a telephone for six months. After that six months, Mr Burke gets 85 per cent of the cost of his telephone bills for life; he gets $13,560 in overseas travel a year; he gets interstate air fares of $2,250 a year; he gets the same postage allowance as a serving member of parliament for six months, which just happens to equal $2,260; and he gets free rail travel for life anywhere in Australia. That is not bad for a disgraced ex-Premier and a disgraced ex-ambassador-to go on fleecing the people of Australia and the people of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting, though, that the $28,000 and the extra $7,500 from last Thursday almost total the $37,000 that Mr Burke has had to pay the Labor Party as compensation for the loss making investments in stamps for which he used money from the $87,000 cash campaign donation that he kept in his office safe. Of course, the Labor Party cannot say whether that $37,000 is adequate until such time as it receives details of the leader's account. How in the world will the Labor Party get copies of any accounts when Mr Burke and his private secretary, Mrs Brush, have already said, `There are no accounts; we kept all the records on the back of an envelope or on the back of a manila folder or elsewhere; we did not think we had to pay tax on interest'? Do people pay tax on interest? Too right they do. Ask any people on the street; they know that they have to pay tax on interest. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of the ex-Premier fleecing the taxpayers, Mr Burke, while Premier, went to the former Labor Party Federal Minister, Don Willesee, who happened at that stage to be the Chairman of the State Parliamentary Remuneration Tribunal, and asked him to change the computation formula for younger members of parliament from 12 times the pension entitlement to 14 times the pension entitlement. I might add that the other member of the Tribunal at that time just happened to be Mr Len Brush, the husband of Mr Burke's private secretary and also Mr Burke's appointed Chairman of the State Superannuation Board, who will also star very well at the Royal Commission. Mr Burke did not get his way that time. He had to wait 12 months. The following year the new chairman approved the scheme that had been proposed by Mr Burke and, very conveniently, backdated it to January 1988, which just coincidentally happened to be one month before Mr Burke retired. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Burke then admitted that the whole idea that he had put to Mr Willesee would bring at least an extra $90,000 into his pocket. It is not bad; Mr Burke has been able to fleece the taxpayer fairly well. It is a disgrace that Mr Burke should have been able to hold his position when his own evidence and that of his obviously very trusted associate, Mrs Brenda Brush, demonstrated at the Royal Commission that he acted with appalling lack of propriety, both prior to his appointment and subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, there is no point in the Government's claiming that witnesses may be lying or that they may have some vested interest in denigrating Mr Burke. All of the evidence has been given on oath. That is why, for the life of me, I cannot understand why Senator Evans, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, kept on saying that they were accusations and innuendo, purely and simply; that they should be disregarded because Mr Burke was doing such a fine job. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See was the person who authorised the investment of $1.9m of a slush fund-over which he exercised full control in 1985 and 1986-earning interest, which I referred to earlier, of $125,000. That income, of course, evaded tax. It will be even more interesting, in the course of time, to know exactly what Senator Beahan and Senator McMullan know about the leader's account. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Maguire just said, `Oh, come on!' Why does he not come on? At the very same time of the operation of that leader's account-Mr Burke has confessed, as has his private, private, private secretary, that they evaded tax- Senator Beahan happened to be the State Secretary of the Australian Labor Party and Senator McMullan happened to be the Federal Secretary of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Neither Senator Maguire nor anybody else can tell me that, when money started flooding in from Mr Burke's leader's account, the people in those two positions did not know anything about it. All I am asking is: what did they know? Have they informed the Government? Have they informed the Australian Taxation Office of what they know and of what they knew at the time? If not, I think more and more questions need to be asked about their propriety as well, their having known of the existence of those accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not innuendo at all to suggest that they know about the accounts because they have admitted that they know about them. It is not a case, as Senator Maguire says, of my smearing them; it is simply stating fact and repeating what they have already said. It is very sad to think that Western Australia has suffered in the way it has over this whole sorry saga. It will continue to suffer because the investment opportunities, while they remain, are certainly unattractive to people from elsewhere because they do not know quite what to expect. The State is paralysed. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at unemployment in Western Australia, one sees that the figure is over 11 per cent-the highest of any State. With the rate of youth unemployment-those under 19 or 20 years-at over 40 per cent, Western Australia certainly cannot go on existing in that state of paralysis. Thanks to Mr Burke and his cohorts, that is exactly what we are looking at in Western Australia for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Royal Commission will go on and on and show how many people's funds have been misappropriated by way of government squandering year after year. Western Australia has some of the highest levels of taxation in the whole of the country; it also boasts the highest levels of unemployment and the highest levels of bankruptcy. But this Government does not seem to care about the bankruptcies; the Government also does not seem to care about the levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was sad to see Senator Cook today at Question Time answer a question from my colleague Senator Lewis as to what Senator Cook estimated the accord was going to do for unemployment. Senator Cook just pooh-poohed the whole idea. He said that unemployment would not get any worse, that, in fact, employment would rise and that we had the highest participation rates of anywhere, at any time or whatever. Senator Cook should tell those people who have lost their jobs and whose businesses have gone broke that they are lucky. They are not lucky, nor are the people of Western Australia, largely thanks to Mr Burke, the Prime Minister, and Senator Evans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating three Bills jointly-Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation Bill (No.5) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2)-all of which relate to the current financial year, 1990-91. They form the additional Budget estimates for this financial year. They cover the unexpected costs of government in running the administration of this country. Those costs were unexpected at the time the Budget was brought down last August and they complete the Budget for the year. The total amount of money in the Bills to be appropriated over and above that in the previous Budget Bills is about $1,000m. In addition to that, the three Bills provide savings of some $270m in relation to funds approved in previous Acts which give effect to this Budget for the current year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very unusual for us to have five Appropriation Bills in a financial year. Normally there are four but a special Bill was brought down in January-Appropriation Bill (No. 3)-to cover the unforeseen costs to the Australian Government of its involvement in the hostilities in the Persian Gulf. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) includes some $28m extra for Austudy and some $5m extra for emergency refugee programs. Appropriation Bill (No. 5) includes, for example, an extra $75m as grants to the States for natural disaster relief. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon, I would like to dispense with the financial facts and figures about these Bills and turn to the economic situation, which I will look at in some depth. I will also look at the changes in Government policy which have been given effect to over the last 12 months in order to level out our economic activity. In regard to the economic indicators, I would like to look at the current recession and at recent economic trends. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, last week there was a great deal of focus on the unemployment figures for April. These were of great concern to all Australians and are a great concern on this side of Parliament. It is understandable that people are concerned that unemployment has reached 9.9 per cent, because many of our Australian colleagues have lost their livelihood, and it is a very uncomfortable time for many Australian families. That 9.9 per cent unemployment rate is almost up to the levels of 1982-83 when unemployment reached a figure of 10.4 per cent. Of course, that period represented the worst recession that Australia has seen since the Great Depression in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is something odd about the figures for the labour market for April in that, while there was a rise in the number of people out of work, the labour force participation rate showed an increase. That is most unusual at a time of recession. The participation rate, of course, represents that proportion of the Australian population of working age who are interested in actually being in the work force. The figures showed an increase of between 10,000 and 11,000 in the number of jobs at the same time that unemployment went to the rate of 9.9 per cent. But, of course, all these figures are preliminary and maybe the final figures for April will be adjusted so that we have a clearer picture of what happened in that month. </PARA>
<PARA> It is relevant to note that, at the same time as the unemployment rate went to 9.9 per cent in April, the Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Banking Group Ltd brought out its regular monthly series on newspaper advertisements for employment in the major capital city newspapers. In that particular month, while unemployment was recorded as rising, for the first time in some months this series published by the ANZ Bank showed an increase in the number of newspaper advertisements for employment. In fact, in that month there was a 3 per cent rise in the number of advertisements in metropolitan daily newspapers regarding opportunities for employment. That was certainly a very interesting contradiction of the unemployment figures for that month. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as we all know in regard to economic management, there are substantial time-lags in the effect of economic policies. The high unemployment figures of today do not reflect the economic policies of today; they reflect the economic policies of 1990 because of time-lags. When a policy is changed it does not mean that economic variables such as investment, employment or unemployment change immediately. They take many months to feed through the system. What we are seeing today is the result of policies that no longer exist but which were in effect in the first half of 1990 and, of course, those policies were changed many months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990, we had very tight monetary policy. The Government through the Reserve Bank was selling bonds in order to reduce the amount of liquidity in the community. High interest rates were the result of that move and they were certainly the more evident result of those open market operations. At the time, 1990, official cash rates, interest rates, were 18.0 per cent. That is the sort of figure we had at the beginning of last year, not at the beginning of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, again in 1990, we had extremely tight fiscal policy. We had a very large Budget surplus, that is, an excess of government revenue over government expenditure through the Commonwealth Budget. In fact, the outcome for last financial year was for a surplus of $8,000m. At the same time as there were high interest rates there was a surplus of $8,000m in the Commonwealth Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is something that the Liberals or the Nationals have never been able to do, that is, to actually develop a Budget surplus in recent times. Senator O'Chee parrots away naively on the other side but the National Party of Australia, of which he is a member, and the Liberal Party of Australia represented alongside him have not recorded a Budget surplus in this country for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last financial year we brought in our third consecutive Budget surplus, and it amounted to $8,000m. It was very unusual to have both tight monetary policy and tight fiscal policy represented through the Budget but that is the reason we had such tight economic conditions and why we now have relatively high unemployment rates. But those policies were not put forward in isolation. They were not developed on the whim of the Government. They were done for a very important reason, which the Opposition very studiously ignores and refuses to talk about, that is, that we have had an excess of import expenditure in Australia over our export proceeds. In other words, we have a deficit on our balance of payments on our current account. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, in particular, total spending in Australia went far ahead of the ability of the economy to produce. As a result of that excess of expenditure over domestic production, there was a spill over into imports which resulted in the rise in the current account deficit on our overseas balance of payments. Of course, that was not sustainable because either one runs down one's foreign currency reserves to fund such a deficit or one has to rely on a capital inflow to make it sustainable in the short or medium term. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government policy has been to slow down growth in the economy, to cut demand and, therefore, to cut the propensity of Australians to purchase imported products. That slowing in the demand for imports has been very successful indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will go on to the Liberals' record in a minute. Senator Panizza is asking for it and he is going to get it. We might look at the success of this particular policy because in the nine months to March 1990, that is, the first nine months of the 1990 financial year, the current account deficit was $17.6 billion. In the nine months to March this year, the deficit has been reduced to $13.4 billion and, of course, the Budget forecast for the year was $18 billion. So the current account deficit is coming well within the Budget expectation of $18 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But more importantly than that, we have moved into surplus on physical trade for the first time in a long time. The actual balance of physical exports compared with physical imports has moved into surplus. In the first nine months of the current financial year, that is, to March this year, the total surplus now is $649m compared with a deficit of $4,200m in the first nine months of the previous financial year. So there has been a substantial turnaround in the balance of trade. It has gone from a deficit to a surplus-a turnaround approaching $5,000m, which is very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the tangible results of the sacrifices which have been made by the Australian community. I admit that sacrifices have been made and pain has been experienced in the labour force, but it has resulted in this very welcome reduction in our dependence on foreign savings to fund the operations of the Australian economy as the excess of exports over imports has developed this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to note, as Senator O'Chee is here in the chamber, that the Budget forecast of $18,000m for this year for the current account deficit on our overseas activities was 4.5 per cent of our total national income-our gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very illuminating to look at the Liberals' record in 1981-82. In that year they had a current account deficit-an actual deficit-of $9,000m when the economy was much smaller than it is now. As a result, the last Liberal government had a current account deficit of 5.8 per cent of gross domestic product. The present deficit was forecast this year at 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product. It will probably be a little lower because, as I have pointed out, the current balance of payments current account deficit is lower than the forecast $18 billion for the year, so this current account deficit will be much more impressive as a percentage of gross domestic product than the deficit in 1981-82. These are some of the achievements that have been mounting very quietly, but positively, regarding the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned that the official cash interest rates were 18 per cent at the beginning of last year. When we proposed easing those interest rates in February last year, a number of people opposite said that, in fact, the reductions in interest rates proposed by the Government were premature, and that we were somehow electioneering when we were proposing to reduce interest rates from the 18 per cent level. That is what they said, they cannot deny it, they are on the record as having said that. That easing of interest rates from the 18 per cent level early last year was appropriate. There have been several rounds of reductions in official cash interest rates since that time and now we have a rate of 11.5 per cent. In other words, there has been a 6 1/2 percentage points cut in official rates in about 15 months. Rates have been cut by well over one-third and that has been reducing the cost of finance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the United Kingdom in a moment; I have been waiting for this opportunity. Late last week, in response to the reductions in the official interest rates, it was very interesting to note that the chief economist of the Commonwealth Bank, which happens to be not only Australia's largest bank but also Australia's largest lender for housing, pointed out that there should be a pick-up in the number of housing starts-the commencements on new dwellings-in the financial year ahead of us. For example, compared with the 122,000 starts of new dwellings this current financial year, the chief economist of the Commonwealth Bank forecasts 134,000 starts next financial year. That is not a Government forecast; that comes from Australia's largest home loan lender.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there will probably be more good news in the pipeline tomorrow when the consumer price index comes out. One of the factors that will generate a very low consumer price index is the Government's trade-off by providing income tax cuts to employees in return for them foregoing gross wage rises, through the process of giving higher after-tax incomes instead of employees being encouraged to demand higher gross wages from their employers. This has meant that costs for business have been kept down and, as a result, this will help to keep down prices in the Australian economy. The report of the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), Business Indicators, which was released yesterday, agrees wholeheartedly that the process of providing tax cuts in order to reduce wage demands will have a beneficial effect on the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> The current consumer price index annual rate is 6.9 per cent to the December quarter last year. Tomorrow we expect to get the March quarter figures. The great thing about those figures is that when they are published, the March quarter figure for last year will come out of the index annual rate-will no longer be in it-and that was a figure of 1.7 per cent. So any figure tomorrow of less than 1.7 per cent will reduce the annual inflation rate below the current 6.9 per cent figure. That is a tremendous achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> The inflation rate at the end of the Liberals' tenure of office was not 6.9, 7.9 or even 8.9 per cent, it was 11.5 per cent. So tomorrow we will be well on track for an inflation rate half the double digit rate that those opposite left office with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee should read the parliamentary publications. The figures are all on the record and it is just a matter of Senator O'Chee learning how to read. If we get a consumer price index figure of 0.7 per cent tomorrow-and that is probably on the high side-that would give us an annual inflation rate of 5.9 per cent. The last time Australia had an inflation rate below 6 per cent on an annual basis was six years ago, in 1985. We are certainly getting inflation out of the system and making Australia much more competitive than those opposite ever did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current average inflation rate of our major trading partners in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) based in Paris is 6.7 per cent. If we get a figure tomorrow of 1.5 per cent or less, we will be below the average inflation rate of our overseas trading partners. That will really give a boost to the competitiveness of Australian business and will certainly help them compete better with imports. </PARA>
<PARA> I put on the record the fact that these predictions are not necessarily only coming from the Government side in the Australian community, but they are also coming from key influential forecasting groups in the private sector in business. I would like to mention some of the forecasts for the inflation rate which is coming out tomorrow, because I suspect that we will not get any questions from the Opposition about the inflation rate for the March quarter. The Opposition will run away from it, because it knows what good news it will be for the Australian economy and what a boost it will give to the competitiveness of Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the forecasts put forward by some of the major forecasting groups in Australia: Syntec is suggesting that by December, Australia's inflation rate will be 3 1/2 per cent-it has not been in that range since the 1960s. Certainly, 3 1/2 per cent would be 8 percentage points below the 11 1/2 per cent double digit rate that the Liberals left Australia with when they went out of office in March 1983. The Westpac Banking Group forecasts a 4 1/2 per cent inflation rate by December this year. So there is one forecast at 3 1/2 per cent and another at 4 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Bain and Company, a large sharebroking organisation based in Sydney, is suggesting a rate of 4 to 4 1/2 per cent-yet another very low forecast. It points out that Australia has had an inflation rate on average, per annum, since 1970 of 9 per cent so that that 4 to 4 1/2 per cent rate will be a very competitive rate. The ANZ Bank Business Indicators publication, which I referred to a moment ago in another context, yesterday forecast an inflation rate possibly below 4 per cent. All of these forecasts are fairly consistent in that 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 per cent range; all of them are from private sector organisations; and all of them suggest that there will be good news for Australia in getting inflation down and in getting price pressures and cost pressures out of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Liberal Party ever got into power, inflation would go through the roof. Throughout the 1970s the Liberals said that they would fight inflation first. I well remember that the keystone to their economic policy was to fight inflation first. When they left office the level of inflation was in double digits-11.5 per cent, as Senator Jones would well remember. These are the people who said that they would fight inflation first, and they failed. </PARA>
<PARA> This time the Liberal Party is going to fight inflation by bringing in a consumption tax. The reality of the Liberal policy is a broad-based consumption tax-a goods and services tax-a tax, as far as I can see, on everything produced in the Australian economy except fuel. Everything produced in the Australian economy would be taxed by the Liberals if they ever got into government and this would blow inflation through the roof. It would add another range of percentage points onto our annual inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a proposal by the Liberals that somehow they could hold down the rate of inflation by removing the current wholesale sales tax and replacing it with a broad-based consumption tax. These are amazing, funny money statistics. I do not know how the Liberals come to these conclusions because at the moment in the Australian economy there are two major areas of expenditure which are almost totally tax exempt, and that is food and clothing. The Liberals' consumption tax would automatically go onto every item in all of those areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. All of us on the Government side of the House will be watching with great interest if those opposite ever get to this position because of the mental and verbal gymnastics that Senator Panizza, Senator O'Chee and all the others on the Opposition side of the House will have to go through when they claim on the one hand that they represent the great food producing industries of this country and on the other hand that they are going to tax them. One has only to do a few calculations to realise that if the Liberals ever got into power and brought in a 15 per cent consumption tax-the most likely level of the tax on my calculations-that would automatically mean that the price of food and clothing would go up by 15 per cent because under the Labor Government those items are substantially tax exempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even with a 12 1/2 per cent consumption tax the annual inflation rate, the consumer price index, would get a kickstart of five percentage points. In other words, it would be lifted five percentage points above the level before the tax was brought in. So if there were a 5 per cent consumer price index at the time the tax was brought in there would be an inflation rate of 10 per cent afterwards. That is the reality of the policies that Opposition senators claim would be a panacea for Australia's economic difficulties and the policies they claim would reform Australia's tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party particularly is trying to be very tricky on the question of a consumption tax. It is trying to create the fiction that somehow food is taxed already. This is one of the fallacies that is being perpetrated. </PARA>

That is the reality of the people opposite-they are trying to create a fiction. Senator Michael Baume has been one of the worst perpetrators of this effort of claiming that food is taxed already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to Senate Question No. 286, which I put on notice some time ago, where I asked what specific food items are subject to current wholesale tax. I have received an answer to this question. I will help Senator Knowles and Senator O'Chee because they got stuck after ice-cream and orange juice. The only food items that are taxed in Australia at the moment are confectionary; biscuits; ice-cream; savoury snacks such as chips; beverages which consist of not less than 90 per cent milk flavouring-in other words, flavoured milk; non-alcoholic wine and cider; fruit juice; and alcohol. Basically, they are the items that are subject to tax at the moment in Australia. Everything else, such as bread, milk, meat, vegetables, groceries-you name it-are totally tax exempt under the Hawke Labor Government. For decades the people opposite have claimed to represent the great food producing industries of this nation, yet they want to put a tax on those industries. They want to have it both ways. They say, `We are not going to tax you', but they will put household food budgets through the roof. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that under the present sales tax policy there is currently a 20 per cent sales tax on alcohol. It is very interesting, comparing a 15 per cent Liberal Party consumption tax with the current 20 per cent sales tax, that the Liberal and National parties are actually proposing to make alcohol cheaper in Australia. There is a deafening silence. The Liberals and Nationals, by proposing a broad-based consumption tax, will bring down the price of alcohol in Australia. I ask: what are the social benefits of such a policy? Do we want a higher road toll in this country? Do we want more and more people in our hospitals? There would be a 15 per cent Liberal Party consumption tax on alcohol compared with the present 20 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I might continue to nail this lie, that food is somehow taxed at the present time, by referring to the Australian Bureau of Statistics regular publication called, Average Retail Prices of Selected Items, Eight Capital Cities, in which the official statistician looks at the retail prices of 44 major food commodities in every capital city of Australia on a quarterly basis. Of those 44 items only two are currently taxed. The other 42 items, examined regularly by the Australian Statistician, are totally exempt from sales tax under the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There we are: it is a fiction that somehow food is taxed at the present time. We saw the Liberals and the Nationals run out of steam here this afternoon. They started with ice-cream, they got up to orange juice and then it stopped. Senator Knowles blustered away and said there were lots of others but she got stuck-she got jammed. I caught them out. I have read out the list of items that are currently subject to sales tax. </PARA>

<PARA> I go to the substance of my contribution to the debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91. I will address three points. The first is the failure of the Federal Government to provide necessary assistance to give students from isolated and remote areas access to education similar to that which is available in urban areas of Australia. Before Senator Tate or anyone else tells me that my speech is a repeat of the speeches made yesterday on this topic, I say that it is not. I am talking about assistance for isolated children in remote areas in order to give them equal access to the education system. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I raise is the failure of this Government in delaying the decision to mine Coronation Hill and develop other resources that should be developed. The third point is the failure of this Government to implement the National Rail Freight Corporation as promised by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) last year. This matter was also the subject of a question which was raised yesterday and which was ducked by Senator Collins, as the Minister representing the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, my contribution, which is about access to equal education, is a not a repeat of the speeches made yesterday. I believe it is a basic right of all students, wherever they are in Australia-in the cities or the country-to have equal access to education, just as we hope that there are equal opportunities for access to everything else. However, with equal opportunities come equal responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australian students do not have that equal right of access to education. In fact, 9,000 children in Australia do not and these are the children living in isolated and remote areas. They do not have that access unless their parents are put under extreme financial pressure. There is a basic allowance available at present that was introduced in 1973 by Mr Kim Beazley, Sr, the then Minister for Education. In 1973, there were 32,000 students in that category. That figure is now down to 9,000, partly because of the provision of extra high schools around Australia. However, the main reason for the drop in that figure is the drain of the population away from the country because of the decisions by this Government to close certain resources and to prevent others from starting up. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1973 payment under the assistance to isolated children (AIC) scheme was set at 55 per cent of average boarding costs. The AIC has been calculated on the difference between the costs of keeping children at home and having them in boarding hostels. I will take a country hostel as the main example in my speech today. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1991, the basic figure available under that scheme is $1,500. That now relates to only 32 per cent of the average boarding costs; that is an exact figure. However, there is further help available. A pamphlet describing the scheme says that, for primary and secondary students under 16, higher amounts can be paid depending on family income and the assets test. So we are back to the assets test. I will not question the existence of the income test, but I believe that the assets test should not be there on that extra amount or that there should be some provision for hardship cases. When it comes to the subject of equal access to education, I believe that nothing should stand in a student's way, irrespective of the financial position of that student's family or the family's location. The fact that the allowance is available does nothing for the people who need it. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the Isolated Childrens Parents Association is looking for that figure to be lifted to $2,650 per annum and indexed so that we do not have to go through the same argument next year, the year after and the year after that. Of course, if we have that indexation, it will take away the need for the 55 per cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA> One can argue that when a student passes 16 years he or she can go onto Austudy. However, as was outlined in the debate we had yesterday, once a student is on Austudy, there is an income and asset test. I believe that that is not the right way to go. Allowances for isolated children should not be assets or income tested. One may ask me why. The answer is that there is a basic right for all to have equal access to education. I fully support income and assets tests for Austudy in normal circumstances. Unfortunately, these are not normal circumstances because we have a position where assets cannot be sold and have no value. As I have said, we have already had this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The plight of the people from remote areas is vastly different. Why should there be assets or income testing when there is a non-availability of schools in remote areas? Except for those 9,000 isolated people, freedom of access to education is available to enable students to matriculate. If students are not given the chance to matriculate when they are at matriculation age, it is very hard for them to get back into study. Unfortunately, if students have to spend a few years away from study before they matriculate, they do not often get back to study later. These include children who do not have access or transport to normal schooling, and I believe that they should have it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no income or assets test on children using the school bus system in Australia; they can travel quite freely. In Western Australia the Government pays, on average, $1,350 per annum to the contractors to allow students to travel on those buses. At least that figure could be added on to the non-income tested allowance that is provided by the Government. That would lift the figure to around $2,850-and that is only to get the children to the school gate. If this access to education is not there, what is the alternative? The only alternative is to board children away. </PARA>
<PARA> If parents are not in a position to board children away, there are a few other possibilities. The first is to change jobs. The second is that the wife can move into town and get a job if possible. The third is that children can leave school, study under distance education and complete only the compulsory years or just leave and be thrown uneducated into the work force. But there are problems with all these options, including the changing of jobs. If a parent moves away from a job, firstly, that person has to find a job wherever he or she goes; and secondly, the work force resource in these remote areas will be removed. A wife moving to town and getting a job also presents problems because there are strains on family relationships. All the other points about children leaving school early create problems. </PARA>
<PARA> With only $1,500-odd available for children in isolated areas to have access to education, parents in these areas try to obtain assistance by other measures. In the present economic downturn it is very hard to do that. I refer to the case of a woman from a Western Australian pastoral region whom I became aware of last week. She did just that: she went in and applied for assistance through Austudy. This was because she was getting only $1,500 through the basic isolated children's allowance. However, she was told that, as a result of assets testing, she was precluded. She explained that they had tried to sell or auction her station but had had no bidders or takers. The fellow who was dealing with her said, `It must have a value of some sort. I will give you $10 for the station, if it has no other value'. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently, she was supposed to take $10 for the station and lose any base that might exist to enable the family to recover, first in order to qualify for this living away from home allowance, or whatever one wants to call it, to enable the children to go to school. Of course, though, if she sold the station she would not be living there any more and could move closer to a school. However, that is the sort of answer that people are getting. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard about another person last week who is in a trucking business. Because of the economic downturn, last year his trucking business lost $8,000 to $10,000. That is what the balance sheet showed for last year. When he asked for some sort of help, he was asked whether he could sell some of the business. The business consists of one prime mover and one tipping semitrailer, which are used to cart material from a stockpile to a crushing plant for one of the mines. What is he supposed to sell? Is he supposed to sell off the trailer, or half the trailer? The officers who deal with these people do not know what they are talking about. I believe that officers of the departments who have to deal with people from these areas should go out and get some training in the field and see for themselves what things are really like. They may then have more commonsense when dealing with people and problems like this. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the matter of country hostels, where most of these children from isolated areas board in order to have equal access to education. I will not compare this situation with the more up-market city schools, though some of those city boarding schools are no dearer than many of the hostels. The average boarding fee for those country boarding hostels in Australia is $4,700 a year. Mind you, only $1,500 is allowed now free of income or assets testing; so, per child, a family has to make up $3,200. Of course, in better economic turns, parents are willing to pay it, but in the current economic downturn it is becoming impossible to get anywhere near it. I refer in particular to Western Australian Government hostels and to the submission of the Federal Council of the Isolated Childrens Parents Association. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> WA Government hostels fees for 1991 are $4,700 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Forty-seven isolated students did not proceed with their bookings for 1991. Twenty-nine students have been withdrawn from hostels in 1991, two from the beginning of second term. Five students from non-government schools in WA have transferred to hostels. Many students have transferred to Distance Education and some have not proceeded to upper secondary. </PARA>
<PARA> One WA hostel has fees on seven students outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales situation is very much the same. The city boarding schools are having difficulties and, to their credit, they have tried to come to some arrangement with the parents so that the children from the isolated areas do not have to pull out of school. It is one thing to attend an elite city boarding school if one is from the city, but the children from the isolated areas have to board somewhere. The average cost of country hostels is $4,700 a year and the average cost of a private boarding school in the city-and I will use Western Australian figures-is around $5,500. So there is not a great deal of difference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in order to make up the difference to the level at which the Isolated Childrens Parents Association is looking, could take that original $1,500 that is provided and add the $1,350 that is being spent on getting children in isolated areas to school on school buses. If those figures are added together we have $2,850 per annum, and that, of course, should remain free of any testing whatsoever. This is to give those children in isolated areas equal access to education. </PARA>
<PARA> I read from submissions made to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. These were submissions to the Committee's inquiry into student financial assistance. I note from this inquiry that most of the submissions came from Western Australia, and so I presume that that is where the most problems lie. The submission from the Shire of Narembeen states:</PARA>
<PARA> This figure is arrived at by using the 4 per cent return suggested above and the current income test cut off point of $32,043 per annum for one child. </PARA>
<PARA>The cut-off point for any assistance is $32,000, and someone with a farming property is deemed to have a return of around 4 per cent. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA>The assets test threshold should then increase by some $318,600 for each additional child . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The assets test cuts off at a certain figure, at whatever it is now, and for farming properties it is around $700,000. But it does not matter whether the family has one child, two children, four or five children, the assets test eligibility figure cuts out at the same level whereas on income testing the income is scaled up. I believe that the Shire of Narembeen has a point. There are submissions from other shires including one from the Shire of Wongan-Ballidu, one from the Shire of Lake Grace, and also one from the Country Shire Councils Association. All of them point out where things are going wrong for isolated children. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if this equal access of opportunity to education is not available in remote areas in Australia, it makes it twice as hard, in comparison with other places in Australia, to keep key personnel, or indeed any sort of personnel, so that the enterprises can continue being run in those places. At this stage I will leave that subject and move on to the matter of mining at Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> Coronation Hill is a prime example of this Government's inertia in opening up resources in Australia. Honourable senators may remember that it was put on hold during the election period of 1990, when the Prime Minister decided that the matter would be handed over to the Resource Assessment Committee to have another look at it. In other words, he was not game to tell us exactly what was going to happen with Coronation Hill until after the election. </PARA>
<PARA> Coronation Hill has known reserves of at least one million ounces of gold. Never have I known of a mine-and I have been in the mining areas all of my life-starting with minimum requirements of deposit without finding an extra lode. I am sure that it would be the same at Coronation Hill. With the known reserves, there is a $500m minimum production. The mine would have a work force of 600 people. If a factor of four is applied, many other jobs are created to keep that sort of enterprise going, the mine would create employment for nearly 3,000 people. If to that figure we add the employment created by the many other resources that we could open up around Australia, we would make a hole in the unemployment in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> I just mention the Jawoyn people for a moment. It is reported that they are against development yet, when I went up there twice for an inquiry held two or three years ago, groups of those people told us that they were certainly interested in getting the mining going ahead. We have heard all the excuses on earth for not proceeding with the mine, including the bula sickness, the spirit and that sort of thing. If I were to use the same sort of arguments and ideas elsewhere, I would be locked up for insanity. I believe that we and the Jawoyn people have progressed beyond that point. </PARA>
<PARA> What annoys me about Coronation Hill is that the excuses for delaying the development of the mine or, indeed, maybe stopping it altogether, can be used anywhere else in Australia. It is in a quite remote area, and has been described earlier as clapped out buffalo country. Exactly the same excuse could be used for delaying any proposed development, whether it be in the Nullarbor, the south west of Western Australia, the Pilbara or the eastern half of Western Australia. If the environmental groups or the Australian Democrats get away with this one, all other resources will cop the same sort of treatment. Many Australians are unemployed at the present moment because of the closing down of mines or because of resources not being opened up. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point on Coronation Hill is that there could be the production of platinum and palladium as well as gold there. Hopefully one day there will be a platinum mine at Fifield in New South Wales. The mine at Coronation Hill could quite easily get off the ground and we could have our first platinum mine. The Government needs to be condemned on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point is on the Government's failure to get the National Rail Freight Corporation going. This idea was mooted by the Prime Minister at the Premiers Conference last year. There was to be a real micro-economic reform of land transport in Australia creating one corporation that would shift freight from all capital cities in Australia with one railway gauge, one industrial agreement and one signalling system. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told how much cheaper the transport of freight was going to be. In that way, the railways would compete more evenly with road transport. There is no way in this world that road trucks should compete with rail across Australia. A single truck should not compete with a train two kilometres long, yet it competes with and defeats rail. We were told how the system was going to work, and it was supported at all times by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the starting date is to be 1 July 1991, nothing has been put in place. I have asked two questions about this in the last three weeks. I have had two non-answers from Senator Collins representing the Minister for Land Transport, Mr Brown, about what is going on. We are certainly being kept in the dark on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of this is that Australian railways as a whole are losing $4 billion a year. Interstate rail accounts for only 12 per cent of rail losses in Australia. It is interesting to note that the Western Australian section of the interstate rail is the only one that is making a profit now. If we can get the whole rail system between all capital cities sorted out, on an even keel and even making a profit, that could be a blueprint for the rest of Australia doing the same and reducing that bleeding of $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister tells us that the hold up is legitimate state rights. I believe in legitimate state rights, but I would like to know why this situation was not foreseen by the Prime Minister, Mr Brown and Senator Collins before they made this announcement. It is all right to make big announcements like that, just like the waterfront reform announcements, and that reform is pretty slow in getting off the mark. Even if the waterfront were to be reformed in the way that is needed, what is the use of having that in place when transport is locked away from the port? The waterfront could still be in the same backward mode. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of great importance that this railways scheme be put into place but the Government, having got a certain amount of publicity out of it last year, has now gone to ground on it and refused to answer questions. As I said before, all those reasons for delay that we have been told about in the last month or so were in existence before. I am afraid that the Government has shot its mouth off about one or two things without thinking or else it did not do its homework. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see freight being shifted by this Corporation by 1 July. There has not been any announcement on a headquarters or on a chief executive. There has been no arrangement about shareholdings or who is going to own the track-whether the Commonwealth or the States individually will own it. None of those questions have been addressed, and we have six weeks to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I condemn the Government on that issue and other issues that I have mentioned, especially Coronation Hill. If we want to get this country moving and to have some credibility with our trading partners in the rest of the world, it is time that the Government addressed these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation Bill (No. 5), gives us the opportunity to look in detail at those issues that we have been able to pursue through the Senate Estimates Committee process and, at the same time, to look at the thrust of government policies and their effects either in the electorates that we represent or, alternatively, in the areas and issues for which we take either individual or shadow ministry responsibilities in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, as shadow Minister for regional development, external territories and northern Australia, I have taken a very keen look at the Budget, the variations and the objectives that the Government is setting out to achieve, particularly at this point of review. As we well know, since the Budget was handed down in August last year the economic climate in Australia under the guidance of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has ended up in a recession, if not a depression, totally engineered by the Treasurer and the Government. For that reason, the Government is to be condemned for the fact that many people-and many industries-are suffering. The consequences being felt throughout the community are severe and damaging both individually and to the national economy, whether in the public or private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Treasurer has somehow dissipated a total amount of $8 billion anticipated surplus, and will probably end up with a deficit at the end of the year, should concern us all. We have ended up with a Labor Government that reminds me of the sorts of lessons one often has to give to growing people in one's own family when they constantly experience the problems as to what to put on hire purchase, on mortgage or on loan and what should be paid for as one goes along. So much of the Budget scenario that has changed since August last year under the direction of the Treasurer and the Government pulls us up constantly in so many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the review process that we have engaged in here in the Senate over the past month or so, I have concentrated on those portfolio and electorate issues that either affect principally regional Australia, northern Australia or, more specifically, the Northern Territory. During the Estimates process I put some 75 questions on notice to the Estimates committees and pursued another 30 or 40 questions in the various hearings and discussions with Ministers and departmental officers. I must say that this year the officers were forthcoming with the responses. I was pleased with the prompt return of questions placed on notice in advance by most of the departments. I can say that, with only a couple of exceptions, I was pleased that the information that we sought has come back in due and proper time. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that I find the answers necessarily totally satisfactory, but given the issues that had to be pursued-and, as I said, in my areas of interest at least 75 major areas across just about every portfolio impacted in some way on regional Australia, northern Australia or the Northern Territory-I would like to take the time of the Senate to look in detail at some of the particular issues that I think still require attention by government and certainly constant action and reaction by the Parliament and, in particular, the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked a number of Government departments this year for information that they necessarily had to incur with regard to the effectiveness of spending millions and millions of dollars chasing, apprehending and repatriating illegal fishermen in north Australian waters. This issue has now blown out of all proportion and has become a major financial burden on Australian taxpayers. In fact, if we look at the departments that have had to make specific appropriations, I find it of concern that in this area we now have departments such as Primary Industries and Energy; Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs; Defence; Small Business and Customs; Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Attorney-General's; and Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories all having to engage in major programs looking at this issue and redressing those matters that should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the information I got from each and every one of those departments proved fascinating. I turn the attention of anyone who wants to pursue them, either in the media or in this place, to the detailed answers given by the respective departments. Unfortunately, unlike in past years, I cannot now put a total financial figure on the commitment in that area. Principally, the Department of Defence has decided that it cannot give discrete financial figures any longer with regard to this particular range of activities. Ironically, in the past it has done so. Last year I received an answer that in the order of $25m related to issues in the Department of Defence. But this year, while the Department has answered a number of questions with regard to the range of activities by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft or by the Naval facilities that have to be applied, the Department could not discreetly give us the information that was required. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of discussion going on, and many interdepartmental committees between the various departments have been set up. The primary responsibility will be sheeted home to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, to pursue top level discussions, particularly with Indonesian authorities, to redress this matter. If it is to cost us $20m, $30m or $40m a year to chase, apprehend and repatriate illegal fishermen in Australian waters, then there is a burden on Australian taxpayers that should not be an ongoing matter without major considerations. Although I accept that there is a need for a great deal of diplomacy because of the other trade arrangements that we have with our Indonesian neighbour, we cannot walk away from the seriousness of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, there are hundreds of illegal fishermen who are apprehended and placed in Western Australian, Northern Territory or Queensland gaols. Perhaps the question should be seriously asked whether special arrangements ought not to be brought into place between Indonesia and Australia to arrange for the early repatriation of those illegal fishermen to serve their sentences in Indonesian gaols. Perhaps the compounding effect of that would be to provide the sort of pressure on the financial interests in Indonesia that are obviously backing the fishermen. I am not referring to the poor guys who work on these ships for whom the Australian pocket money handed out in gaols would often be a more advantageous benefit than the wages they receive, but to the fact that such action would heighten and put pressure on the business backers at home. The responsibility should be for the cost to be borne either by the regional administrations overseas, whether in Indonesia or other countries, or by the business interests. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a major issue. With so many departments now having to divert their resources rather than carrying out the primary purposes that we normally would have anticipated in those areas, it is a matter of major concern that the Government must address as a matter of urgency and priority. </PARA>
<PARA> In alluding to the issue of defence, let me also look at the continuing saga that surrounds the RAAF base at Tindal at Katherine in the Northern Territory. This base was finished several years ago. We are now well aware from the questioning that I undertook of the Defence Housing Authority and the Australian Construction Services of the Department of Administrative Services that there were a great many issues that were totally unresolved at the time that those contracts were concluded. The Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, acknowledged with regard to the Estimates of the Department of Administrative Services that a number of cases of fraud were still not properly concluded or finally investigated. It concerns me that so many of these issues still remain a saga and obviously will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> In one of the answers to my questions the Department replied that investigation of the 12 allegations of fraud that had been under investigation had now ceased through lack of substance or lack of evidence. There were a number of reasons why these 12 cases were not pursued. Some 17 allegations had been investigated and now only five matters remain under active investigation. Twelve have slipped off the agenda, despite the fact that they obviously demanded urgent attention. Millions of dollars-Australian taxpayers' dollars-were involved in the construction of this very significant and major project. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we then see when we look in a different area-at the Defence Housing Authority-and at the estimates now required for expenditure on repairs and maintenance of the defence housing at Tindal? It is not just the routine maintenance that would normally crop up a year or two, or perhaps five or six years after the contract had been concluded, but the repairs and maintenance are now covering up the issues arising from inadequate construction or fraudulently constructed buildings that now require major redress. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an issue that will not go away. It is an issue that requires and demands urgent Government attention-particularly with regard to the pursuit of the slack administration of Australian Construction Services. I believe that Senator Bolkus has to give a lot more attention to this matter, and it is a matter that I will certainly pursue with him. I am aware of many of the folklore stories which are now arising several years after things have been concluded. Nevertheless, I do not want to see criminals or people who have fraudulently ripped off the Commonwealth Government getting away just because time has slipped away and public servants have been shuffled in the pack from one posting to another. We certainly need to be aware that many issues need to be redressed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of defence, it also concerns me that the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, is proposing to make a major statement to the Parliament-I believe on 6 June-about the long term planning of defence facilities throughout Australia. I am pleased that in recent years the Government and the Parliament have recognised the priority of ensuring that Australia's defence has a northern Australian focus and that projects such as the 2nd Cavalry Regiment near Darwin are receiving priority. But we have to ensure that there is no slippage in the construction works program of projects such as the 2nd Cavalry Regiment or for additional fuel storage at RAAF base Tindal, where it is obvious that the planes could not be kept in the air for a decent exercise or for a decent engagement if that was required. Again, the questioning brought out that point and highlighted many of those areas.</PARA>
<PARA> In my review of the Department of Employment, Education and Training I was concerned about some of the information given to me as answers with regard to the funding that is made available to non-government schools. In northern Australia in particular, Aboriginal students make a very proper demand on the private school system. In order to accommodate secondary school students in particular, it is necessary that appropriate levels of government funding are paid to these non-government schools to ensure high student retention rates, that Aboriginal students will receive proper and high levels of education and that there will not be any discrimination anywhere in Australia against, particularly, Aboriginal children who need these facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers that were given to me by the Department in this area give me cause for great concern. A college near Darwin, St John's College, which is run by the Catholic education system, in correspondence with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), Senator Collins, Mr Snowdon and me has continually highlighted the problems that it has because of the finicky attitudes of the Department concerning the level of funding that it provides to a private school. It really means that Aboriginal students are not receiving the proper and appropriate levels of funding needed in order to advance their education. It is the skinflint attitude of the Department in not recognising this particular area which causes me major concern. </PARA>
<PARA> But, on the other hand, there is a problem arising from a school not doing the right thing. I refer particularly to an independent Aboriginal school in Alice Springs, the Yipirinya School, which has received significant ceding grants-both for capital and recurrent expenditure and ongoing recurrent funding-of a major amount. Yet what do we see here? My criticism is not of the Government but of the staff of the new school. Because there is an Aboriginal cause being pursued in the Alice Springs community which relates to the provision by the Northern Territory Government of a flood mitigation dam, we find that staff have not given their full attention to the school but, under the very generous funding that the Commonwealth Government has made available to the school, have for weeks at a time been very actively agitating, promoting and spending time at public protests. That is a misuse of the generosity of government funding that is made available for the provision of facilities to Aboriginal people which requires open comment and open criticism. In that case, I hope the Department and the auditors go in and make the appropriate adjustments-if necessary to the funding-but not at the expense of the Aboriginal students in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to the funding by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) of the Aboriginal radio network and media association in central Australia-the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, commonly referred to as CAAMA. For the last two years this organisation has constantly demanded public scrutiny. I have certainly been quite open in my criticism of the funding of this particular organisation. I am aware that the management consultants, KPMG Peat Marwick, undertook, in association with the Media Association's own board, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and ATSIC, a major review of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the middle of last year, and at the Estimates hearings in October last year, I have been asking to see the reports of that organisation-the draft report of 1990 and the concluded report of 1991-in order that we can assess the effectiveness of the millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds that have been put into this media organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> This week I finally received a copy of that report-some hundred pages of it-from an anonymous source. It turned up in my mailbag. It is a very disturbing document. If the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has had it on his desk since January of this year, or if the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) has had it on his desk since January of this year-the date of the report-I hope that the Government has not only pulled out the whips but has demanded that there be very significant changes to management financial controls within the organisation of CAAMA in Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of that organisation and its associated company, the Imparja television station of Alice Springs, are demanding and both organisations have positive roles to play in the community. But at the same time, if these organisations are guilty of slack management or slack financial control, that is certainly not in the best interests of the Aboriginal constituency or the people of the Northern Territory who depend on their services. I certainly hope that all of the Ministers with interests in the areas of communications, Aboriginal affairs and education will read the report as I have done and will guarantee that an immediate and effective change is brought about in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I am looking at the issues related to the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs, I point out that I have asked more than 20 questions on notice. As I said in my general comments, I was happy with the satisfactory answers that were given to the majority of the questions. But I would highlight for the Senate's attention a couple of issues that I think do need to be pursued with a little more scrutiny and accountability and a little more questioning. One relates to the generous funding that was made available this year to enable Aboriginal participants to attend the World Council of Churches General Assembly in Canberra as delegates. In that regard I note that the board of ATSIC made available a grant of $130,552 to the Australian Council of Churches as a contribution to the costs of the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the Special Assembly of the World Council of Churches, held here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of that funding I certainly question. I believe that a very significant amount was made available to assist in the funding of travel, for media coordinators, media teams, promotional kits, team visits and Top End participation. Whilst the issue of Aboriginal reconciliation is an important one on the Government's agenda, and an important one for this Parliament and the nation to address, I believe that much of the activity needs to be carefully monitored against the often generous funding which ends up being spent on nothing more than advertising and for promotional purposes, rather than on the delivery of services which are so needed in the Aboriginal community in order to address the major problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that, with moneys received from mining royalties, the Central Land Council, an independent organisation under its own charter, allocated $16,411 additionally for the World Council of Churches conference and the Northern Land Council in the top part of the Northern Territory allocated expenditure of about $11,209. I do note that the Tiwi Land Council, with which Senator Collins would be very familiar, made no expenditure provisions in this regard, despite the fact that it is probably the most Christian Aboriginal community in northern Australia, as a result of its own history. Obviously if any of the Tiwi people chose to participate in that conference, they did so from other than government-sourced finances. Therefore, it is a matter of questioning value received in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio to which I would like to pay particular attention relates to the necessary streamlining of the provisions of the community development employment program. This is a program that has now been under way for many years and reaches and services many Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. In the broad, it is a very worthwhile program. It replaces the provision of unemployment and many other forms of benefits in Aboriginal communities. It institutes a concept of work-related activity and management of those activities in each and every one of the participating Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the answers that have been provided, to both the Estimates Committee and various questions on notice from a number of honourable senators in each State and Territory of Australia, again cause concern in the areas of accountability and scrutiny and in areas where fraud and so many other issues have been allowed to creep in through mismanagement and the lack of appropriate guidelines and supervision. I know that ATSIC has turned its attention to this matter and is carefully monitoring the whole provision of services in this area. This is an area that we cannot walk away from. If we are to ensure that the Aboriginal beneficiaries of the particular scheme get the maximum benefit in each and every one of their communities, we must be constantly vigilant in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point under the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs relates to government assistance to a number of Aboriginal communities near the township of Katherine in the Northern Territory. The Kalano Community Association Inc. and the Binjarri community both receive grants from the Government. Unfortunately, in the past year or so there has been a serious fracturing of the relationships in those communities, between the Aboriginal people and Aboriginal management, and also a lack of trust and a lack of coordination between the officers of ATSIC and a number of people associated with either Kalano or Binjarri. </PARA>
<PARA> From the pursuits and representations I have made in this regard over the past six or eight months, I am still not convinced that the services so desperately needed by hundreds of Aboriginal families in great need are being properly recognised by ATSIC, although I appreciate its arms length distance from the Government. At the same time we must continue to stress the priorities. Because of the close association to the Katherine community, we must ensure that this situation is not allowed to become a flashpoint. It is one of those issues in which we-whether it is the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Collins or myself-must continue to take a close responsibility for ensuring that the proper finances are getting through, that the essential services relating to health, education and housing are provided, and that efforts are not thwarted and frustrated by personalities in either politics or in the local community. </PARA>
<PARA> The national Aboriginal health strategy was a very important document tabled in the Parliament some time ago. There are many initiatives that will arise from government departments at the State, Northern Territory and Commonwealth level, and various agencies. It is always important to ensure that the amount of money getting through is properly reaching those who need it most. I am concerned that the provision of research facilities in Aboriginal affairs also needs to be closely monitored. </PARA>
<PARA> One such project relates to the financial assistance that has been allocated for the continued public health research into neurological syndrome amongst the Aboriginal people of Groote Eylandt in the area close to the manganese mining deposits. ATSIC appears to have walked away from the traditional funding that it has given to the research that is going on into this important problem by the Menzies School of Health Research based out of Darwin. In particular, I commend the work of Dr Tim Burt, the Medical Officer, Public Health Research, involving the Angurugu community on Groote Eylandt. </PARA>
<PARA> The work that Dr Burt and other people associated with him are undertaking is important for the future lifestyle of hundreds of people on Groote Eylandt. I was concerned that the answer given to me on issues raised in this regard merely flicked the matter aside. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>While ATSIC acknowledges the need for security of funding for the research team, ATSIC cannot guarantee further funding for research work. Menzies School of Health Research will be advised of this and it is recommended that they should continue to approach research organisations for funds to continue their work after June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst there naturally has to be an assurance that government funding does come through appropriate areas, this again is indicative of other areas where the Government appears to lose sight of its priorities and lose its will. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other issues that I would like to have addressed, some of which I shall have to take up in the committee stage. Regional Australia, northern Australia and the external territories are all important to Australia and its economy. In this very difficult time, irrespective of whether it is a recession or depression, I hope that the Government will pick up the need for ongoing support in so many of these functional areas. </PARA>

Senator Short was probably too generous, in moving the amendment, in simply mentioning that the Government has caused a severe and protracted recession. Senator Walsh, a Government senator, was probably far more correct when he said that the Government has, in fact, caused a depression. It does not mean much in the semantics of the word, I suspect, except to show that Australia is now facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's disgraceful record in managing the economy is shown in no better way than in the number of unemployment benefit recipients at the last seasonally adjusted estimates given out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force survey. The survey showed that a total of 844,000 persons in Australia were unemployed and receiving unemployment benefit. This equates to a seasonally adjusted estimate of unemployment at 9.9 per cent for April. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume says, there is a moral in that. It is a simple message that I think the Australian public is now getting; that is, that the Australian Labor Party is simply unable to manage the economy. The unemployment rate in the Liberal governed State of New South Wales is less than the national average. Let us examine the unemployment rate in the Labor States: in Victoria it is 10.5 per cent, well above the 9.9 per cent national average; in Queensland, my own State, 10.7 per cent; in South Australia, 10.3 per cent; and in Western Australia, a massive 11.1 per cent. One can only wonder, with respect to the Western Australian figure, why it is not higher. Even in Tasmania, another Labor governed State, it is 10.8 per cent-well above the national average.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is in all of those Labor governed States that the unemployment rate has exceeded 10 per cent. This is in spite of the commitment that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave on 4 December 1990 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is this: unemployment will not reach double digit figures. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that in Queensland the unemployment rate continues to increase from 10.2 per cent in March. In February last year, not long after the Labor Government took over, it was only a small 7.1 per cent. It has increased and blown out since the Labor Government took over in my State. There are 155,300 Queenslanders presently unemployed in Mr Goss's State. The figure does not include the part timers and those who have simply given up trying to get work. That is an increase of over 100,000 since February 1990 and since Mr Goss took over the reins of government in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> In the north Brisbane regional offices of the Department of Social Security, the number of unemployment benefit recipients continued to increase in April 1991 over and above the record high level of March 1991. In the north Brisbane regional offices of Alderley, Chermside, Fortitude Valley and Nundah, a total of 11,263 people are in receipt of unemployment benefit. That figure has increased substantially since last month and it has massively increased since a mere 18 months ago when the Goss Government took over. In the Toowoomba regional office the number of unemployment benefit recipients remains at the very high level of 5,371. </PARA>
<PARA> Bankruptcies Australia-wide have increased by 53.6 per cent. But in Queensland-Mr Goss's State, the man who claims that he is the great economic manager-bankruptcies have increased by 60.2 per cent; that is exceeded only by the increase in Victoria of 75.2 per cent. Who would want to be compared with Victoria? But I must say that Mr Goss, our Premier in Queensland, said that he wanted to do for Queensland what John Cain had done for Victoria-and he is certainly going about it the right way. Victoria is the only State which has a higher increase in bankruptcies than Queensland. The gross foreign debt in Australia is now $165 billion. For each Australian, that is $9,114. The cost of servicing that debt alone takes 20c out of every dollar we export. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's mismanagement of the economy is, I suppose, exemplified by Senator Bolkus's complete lack of any managerial or administrative competence in the way he administers his Department of Administrative Services. That is very clearly shown by the way he has made a complete mess-I use the word `mess' rather kindly; less generous people would say worse things--</PARA>

The companies had put in responses, tenders had been accepted and Senator Bolkus then, quite improperly, with a lack of any propriety, altered the decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus's administration of his portfolio, however, slips further into the superdoubtful category as a result of some information which I have received, through the Estimates committees, dealing with something in the Attorney-General's Department but which Senator Bolkus's Department was in charge of. I am not sure whether it is a problem for Senator Tate or Senator Bolkus, who is in charge of the Australian properties group. Neither Minister has shown any great managerial or business efficiency in the running of their departments. I will leave it to them to try to work out who is at fault and who should wear the blame. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers from the public servants who appeared before Estimates Committee E tell me that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in Sydney had a lease on a place called Kindersley House. They were quite nice premises, of 2,680 square metres. They existed on a lease which commenced on 1 July 1984 and which was renewed for four years on the same date in 1988. The current rental paid on Kindersley House is $1.098m per annum. In addition to that, the tenant pays outgoings of about $40,000 per annum, so the total rental package is $1,137,977. </PARA>
<PARA> The Administrative Appeals Tribunal continues to occupy that property at the present time, apparently on a lease from Essington Pty Ltd. However, since 30 June 1990, apparently the Commonwealth no longer pays rent there. It is still occupying the place, but it does not pay rent there any more of about $1.137m. Instead, it is paying rent on a place called City Centre where the rent is some $264,000 more than the rent on Kindersley House. The rent paid there is $1.3m and the outgoings are $100,000-so it is paying a total of $1.4m on premises it is not yet occupying. </PARA>
<PARA> One might well ask: how could that occur? The tenant-the AAT-had an agreement with a company called Ozton Pty Ltd which, I am informed, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Essington. Essington, as I understand it, is the owner of both Kindersley House and City Centre. The agreement with Ozton was that Ozton would pay the difference in rent. This is all very fine if Ozton continues to operate as a company. But I am informed by officers of the Attorney-General's Department that Ozton was experiencing financial difficulties. As I understand what I have been told in the Estimates Committee, there were certain protections built into the agreement with Ozton. Why the agreements were made with Ozton and not Essington, I am not quite sure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked for copies of these documents, but they have not yet been made available to me. The questions I asked about these particular matters relating to the parties to the contract were not answered in the Estimates Committee and I have not yet been given the copies of the documents to make my own further research into them. But from the answers I have been given, this appears to be the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is abundantly clear that the Australian Property Group, the Minister for Administrative Services and/or the Attorney-General's Department have not operated as a prudent commercial developer would operate in its dealings with its leased premises in Sydney. As I understand it, if the rent was not paid on Kindersley House, could Essington-the owner-not sue the Commonwealth for the rent not paid? Honourable senators will remember that, by a deed of amendment signed by Ozton on 20 June 1990, it was agreed that the Commonwealth was to be released from paying rent on Kindersley House-that is, presumably paying rent to Essington. </PARA>
<PARA> Having Ozton agree to this-by saying that the Commonwealth would not have to pay the rent to Essington because it would pick up the difference in price-is a huge protection if Ozton is in liquidation. Would the deed of amendment releasing the Commonwealth from payment of the rental on Kindersley House not properly be the agreement of Essington rather than Ozton? If Ozton is simply saying that it will indemnify the Commonwealth against any rent that Essington might call up, because Ozton is, I assume, in receivership, in liquidation or has had a receiver manager appointed, the indemnity would be quite worthless. </PARA>
<PARA> In a written reply to a question I put in Estimates, the Attorney-General's Department says that in an agreement entered into on 5 December 1989-and that date is important-supposedly surrendering the lease, certain protections were included for the Commonwealth. But the usual and very standard clauses in building contracts which do give real protection seem to be missing from this particular lease. I might add that this lease is being done by the Australian Property Group on behalf of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Attorney-General's Department-the Commonwealth's top legal advising Department-but the contract seems to be anything but a quality one, particularly where the Commonwealth is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the clauses in that particular agreement providing for the usual form of bank guarantees? Where are the clauses providing for the usual form of retention moneys? Where are the clauses providing for the usual forms of liquidated damages? Where are the clauses providing for directors or parent company guarantees to the agreements that this newly formed subsidiary company, Ozton, was to give?</PARA>
<PARA> In itself the use of the word `protection' by the Commonwealth shows just how completely naive the Commonwealth has been in its commercial dealings on this particular matter. Calling something a protection-as the Department did in an answer to some questions I put at the Estimates hearing-does not ipso facto mean that it gives protection. These agreements particularly show that. The real protection agreements that are usually included in clauses like this do not appear to be there. If they are there, they have not been told to me and they certainly have not been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known in building industry circles and in legal circles that the Commonwealth Government is an easy touch. It is an easy adversary in these types of building agreements because its contracts are widely regarded in the industry as being badly administered and the quality of its legal advice in relation to these contracts is not particularly well regarded in the industry. As I understand it, the Commonwealth is still paying rent on the City Centre building from 20 June 1990, even though it is not in occupancy. I suspect that the Commonwealth is still liable to Essington for the rental on the Kindersley House tenancy if Ozton's promise proves to be ineffective. That is bad enough, but there is more to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The new premises that the Commonwealth is paying rent on, but not occupying, had to be fitted out. The usual Commonwealth Government efficiencies have prevailed again! As an incentive to move early and take on a bigger rent in the long term, Ozton was to do the fit-out of the new premises in the City Centre building completely free of charge to the Commonwealth. What a fine deal that is: it does not cost the Commonwealth anything. Ozton will do the fit-out for the Commonwealth completely free of charge and Ozton will also pay the relocation costs for the Commonwealth-a very attractive arrangement which was well negotiated by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The fit-out started in December 1989, but on 31 May 1990, some six months later, the Australian Property Group advised that the fit-out had ceased due to `financial difficulties being experienced by Ozton'. I am unable to ascertain whether Ozton is in receivership, whether it has a receiver manager appointed, whether it is in liquidation or whether it is in voluntary winding up. I wonder whether anyone in the Government knows either, because no-one seems to have been able to tell me. If someone does know, he certainly has not been forthcoming with the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1990 the Australian Property Group advised that Ozton was unable to complete the fit-out owing to financial difficulties being experienced. But just a few days later Ozton signed a document with the Government agreeing to pay the difference in rent between the rent payable on Kindersley House and the City Centre premises-that is, after Ozton said it was in financial difficulties. Ozton then agreed to compensate the Commonwealth for the $300,000 or $400,000 extra that it was going to be paying for the new premises which the Commonwealth was not yet occupying. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that the Commonwealth has exercised its rights under what is referred to in the written answers to some of my Estimates questions as a deed of agreement to complete the fit-out. So the Commonwealth is now taking over the completion of this fit-out. As a result of this, the Commonwealth comes back to this Parliament and asks for an extra $3.723m of taxpayers' money to complete the fit-out of a building that it had arranged for someone else to do. This Government has come back to this Parliament to ask for more money-almost $4m-to do something that should have been done by someone else. This is a staggering amount that the Australian taxpayers are going to be asked to foot the bill for, at a time when they are already struggling under the huge amount of government taxes and the huge difficulties which the economy generally is suffering as a result of this Government's mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the original idea of getting Ozton to pay the $3.7m fit-out for the Commonwealth was a pretty good deal-get someone else to do it and the Commonwealth gets $3.7m of free fit-out if it takes the new premises. But we all know that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Even if one is getting that supposedly free, it is added on into the rental that is paid later; that is normal commercial practice. So the $3.7m fit-out was being done free of charge but the rent that the Commonwealth had negotiated for the new premises-no doubt in accordance with normal commercial practices-took into account that additional capital outlay. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will remember that Ozton is not paying the almost $4m. We the taxpayers and we the Commonwealth have got to pick that up because Ozton has not got the money to do it any more. But has there been any corresponding reduction in the rental payable on the lease? Has there been any corresponding reduction in the rental that would have been increased because Ozton or Essington was paying for that fit-out? The answer that I have been given in Estimates is, `No, there has not'. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this Government's mismanagement-Senator Bolkus's continuous incompetence in his Department, or Senator Tate in his Department-we are the bunnies, the taxpayers who have to pay the additional high rental because we are getting the you-beaut deal of $4m worth of free fit-out. But we are not getting it; we are paying the high rental and we are also picking up the tab for the $4m fit- out. That is why the Government has had to come back and ask for more appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> At page E46 of the Hansard of 18 April 1991, the Department tells us that the Government has certain rights that the Department will be pursuing and that it will no doubt take legal action against Ozton. It is a great confidence booster if the company it is going to sue to recover the cost of the fit-out has already said that it has does not have enough money to complete the fit-out. If it has not got the money to complete the fit-out, what makes anyone think that the Government will be able to sue it, get a judgment and, by waving a magic wand, the company, to pay out the judgment, will find the money that it could not find previously. </PARA>
<PARA> As I am advised, we are due to take possession of the new you-beaut premises in September 1991, but what do we have at this time? We seem to be renting two buildings. We seem to be paying rent on the bigger one but I suspect that the indemnity we have against paying rent on the first one is worthless, in which case we are still liable to pay rent on the first one. In all probability, we will be paying rent on two buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> We are paying $300,000 to $400,000 more rent than we should be paying, because we are still occupying the old premises and we are paying rent on the new increased rental premises. Ozton was going to kick in to save us from having to pay that extra amount, but it is in financial difficulties. We also have this new lease that has been negotiated where the owner was to fit out the premises and save us that $4m, which would compensate us for the higher rent we are paying. But, lo and behold, we find that the owner will not pay the $4m fit-out and we will be paying it. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, if you are perplexed so far by the Government's handling of this matter, there is more to come. I am still trying to get an answer from the Government on the upper limit of Government expenditure which can be arranged without going to an open and public tender. I have not had an answer from the Government yet on that limit, but I think it would be well below the $3m or $4m that we are having to pay out. If it is not, then it jolly well should be. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not hold up the Burdekin Shire Council as an example of what the Government should do. But in my days on the Council, when we had a tender over $10,000, I think it was, it had to go to a public open tender, and that was done for very good reasons. Although nobody has ever been able to tell me-and I thought that it would have been an easy thing to tell-I am sure that the Commonwealth Government would have a similar procedure, so that a tender of the magnitude of $4m must go to open public tender. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department has advised me that the single select tender process was used. I am not sure what that means. As a small-town country lawyer, maybe I could be excused for not knowing what the term the single select tender process means. I have made some inquiries of Sydney property lawyers who deal with leases and commercial properties and they do not know what that term means, either. So whether it is an attempt to say that the Government did not have to call tenders in this particular instance, and it could use this process, I am not sure. I wait anxiously for a departmental answer on that. I did ask officers of the Department whether, if they were fitting out the premises initially and the cost was to be $3m to $4m, they would have called tenders themselves. Their answer was `Of course'. If they would have done so then, then why did they not do it in this case?</PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that there is no suggestion of impropriety in awarding large government contracts, a system of rules has evolved which no doubt would require that open and public tenders are invited to give all Australian companies the chance to get some work in these difficult economic times and also to keep the process open and above board. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this system usually attracts the cheapest price and the most honest and open form of tendering, I am aware that Senator Bolkus does not have much regard for this sort of open, honest tendering and, as he proved with the Nashua contract, he has no hesitation in interfering and letting preferred companies have a second bite of the cherry. Notwithstanding his inability to understand propriety and normal business ethics, there is much to say for preserving open, honest and accountable public tendering. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will appreciate that the Commonwealth is taking over this contact for the fit-out of the building, which is being done by a company called Desaro Pty Ltd. I have no details of that company but I am sure that it is a very well managed and reputable company. That is not the point. It may be-and I do not know-that Desaro has common directors or shareholders with Ozton or Essington. It may be that there is commonality of interest or, alternatively, there may be personal friendships between the owners of Desaro and the owners of Ozton. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we know that in a perfectly normal and honest arrangement-I am not saying that there is anything wrong with this-Desaro has not given a concessional rate for other work it has done for Ozton or Essington, or the directors or shareholders, but is recouping any such concessional price on an increased price on this particular contract? I am not suggesting that that has happened. I am saying that, if we do not go to public open tenders, we will never know whether this sort of thing went on. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty that Ozton finds itself in at the moment is a sad indictment of the financial and economic mismanagement of this Government. No doubt, sadly, Ozton forms one of those statistics which I quoted originally showing that bankruptcies in New South Wales have reached 47.3 per cent. That does not alter the fact that there are a lot of questions to be answered in relation to this particular piece of Government bungling. The Government's repeated bungling of this very sensitive issue of honest and competent acceptance of a Government contract involving large amounts of taxpayers' money provides concern as to whether we are getting honest to goodness value for the money that taxpayers provide for these things. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe it is time to establish a tender review board to oversee the Government's inept handling of tenders of which we have been getting details recently. Where questions are raised about the propriety of the Government tender process, perhaps the matter should be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is a sad indictment of the Government's ineptitude. From the answers that I have been given today, it appears that the Department of Administrative Services, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Attorney-General's Department have completely bungled a commercial lease of a premises in Sydney which has cost the taxpayers $4m. It has left the taxpayers with a deal on rental which is grossly in excess of what we should be paying because the fit-out that was to be done by the owner is not now being paid for by the owner but is being paid for by the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I await with some anticipation an explanation by the Government-by Senator Bolkus, by Senator Tate, or by whoever is responsible-of how it could have been caught so nicely and has to seek $3.7m additional funding in these Appropriation Bills to rectify what at this stage can only be seen as a classic but all too common and continuing example of government bungling and inefficiency. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation Bill (No. 5) is a good opportunity to review the economic crisis Australia finds itself in today. It will be useful to examine how we actually got here. There seems to be general agreement that high interest rates-a deliberate policy of this Government-were the major cause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The admitted purpose of high interest rates was to reduce economic activity with the purpose, in turn, of reducing imports and Australia's foreign debt. One could argue that this is indeed a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. The Australian Democrats have always argued that it is possible to reduce our imports-and they should be reduced-by specifically targeted measures. But unfortunately, the ideology that we now subscribe to as a nation, led by our econocrats, by this Government and by the Opposition, is that we must leave it to the marketplace. So the strategy was adopted to reduce economic activity across-the-board to reduce imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, after about 12 months of a gradually worsening recession, we have finally achieved some slight reduction in imports. In March the imports declined by $410m, still leaving us with a net trade deficit for the month of $1.2 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in February. Our foreign debt is still a net figure of $130 billion. Meanwhile, however, considerable damage has been done to the economy. Bankruptcies are up 53 per cent compared with a figure in March last year. In Victoria they are up 75 per cent. In the three-month period, 729 companies went to the wall and, Australia-wide, 844,000 people are unemployed-up 60 per cent on the figure of 524,700 a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an enormous waste of skills, experience and productive capacity and, on the other side of the ledger, there is mounting human misery multiplied many thousand times over, foreshadowing a rising crime rate, broken marriages, increased drug addiction and all the other socially corrosive consequences which follow inevitably when people are prevented from earning their own living. I will cite one example recently reported in the Melbourne Sun-Herald newspaper on 10 March 1991. I quote from an article by Nicole Newton headed, `Home violence soars as recession takes its toll'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>One of Victoria's three leading crisis contact points, the Women's Information and Referral Exchange, has reported a 100 per cent increase in cases of domestic violence compared with March last year. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the inevitable result of Government inaction, of `leaving it to the market'-today's doctrinaire ideology-which, in our view, is total abdication of responsibility which was aided and abetted by the Liberal-National Party coalition. Throughout this debate the conservative parties-the free marketeers-could hardly conceal their glee at having their policies implemented by a Labor government which had forgotten its roots, extinguished the light on the hill and busied itself selling strategic footholds in the economy such as the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The coalition parties are now wringing their hands and shedding crocodile tears but they are just as culpable as the Government-even more so, because it could be argued that the Government has not governed well but that the Opposition has totally forsaken its role of opposition, and the record shows it. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be useful and instructive to look at the record of cooperation between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The old parties combined to vote against moves by the Democrats which were designed, firstly, to establish a register of foreign ownership of Australian land, property, business and resources as a first step to stop us selling our assets; secondly, to extend the general anti-tax avoidance provisions to all rebates, foreign tax credit and withholding tax to stop our revenue haemorrhaging as it has been for years; thirdly, to amend the Commonwealth Bank legislation to ensure that it could not be totally privatised and sold to foreign interests-commitments which were made to the Australian Labor Party caucus; and, fourthly, to prevent lifting the export market development grant threshold to levels which exclude most small businesses. Apparently this Government believes that big business only is entitled to get some assistance to increase our exports; and fifthly, to exempt from sales tax recycled plastics, recycled paper products and communication aids, cars and other equipment used by disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other instances where the two old parties have combined to oppose Democrat reform initiatives, but these few examples illustrate clearly the view of economic policy that the Government and the coalition parties take severally and jointly as distinct from what it should be. Instead of abdicating responsibility to the marketplace-which has no values except the dollar sign on the balance sheet-economic policy and economic measures should be used to meet needs, goals and aspirations of people and, indeed, of the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> In the view of the Democrats, a society which is socially and economically just, environmentally responsible and democratically controlled, should be the objective of a government policy designed to influence the economy to achieve these objectives. It is a concept and a vision which appears to be beyond the grasp of both of the old parties, which vie with each other in selling public assets and then creating the sort of dog-eat-dog society where the rich get richer and the poor are trampled underfoot in an inexorable cycle of disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> With an officially acknowledged unemployment rate of 10 per cent-probably more closely in the region of 15 per cent-and with a 27 per cent youth unemployment rate, it is time for the Government to acknowledge that Mr Keating's policies have failed and that carefully targeted government intervention is of the utmost urgency. In answer to a question of mine yesterday Senator Button, representing the Treasurer (Mr Keating), could not name one measure the Government would take to reverse the rising tide of unemployment. Let me offer, then, a few suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short term it is essential to stop the growing spate of business failures and to get people back to work. The first measure that the Australian Democrats would urge the Government to initiate is a further one per cent drop in interest rates. The second one would be elimination of payroll tax by the States, which could easily be paid for by a 2c a litre petrol excise and a 40 per cent lift in the excise on alcohol and tobacco. In the debate on Austudy yesterday I had occasion to challenge the Government to declare its priorities as to whether it wished to continue to have a 27 per cent youth unemployment rate, or whether it had the political will to get some means from an increased excise on alcohol and tobacco products which add to our health bill every day.</PARA>
<PARA> The next measure that the Democrats would favour is a 5 per cent bounty to be paid to exporters on new exports. Last year the Government would have paid $140m on additional exports of $2,800m. It would have been cheap to double that at a cost of a further $140m. The accelerated depreciation allowance, which was heralded with such a lot of noise in the industry statement, is little more than a technical adjustment. The Democrats believe that accelerated depreciation on manufacturing equipment to increase investment expenditure is essential in carefully targeted and selected industry sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating rightly chastised the business community for wasting the increased share of profits the accord has delivered to it since 1986. If business is not prepared to invest in Australia, then company tax should perhaps be increased again and the funds channelled into infrastructure and technological investment in government business enterprises. If that does not work, maybe we should introduce a research and development guarantee scheme, based on the training guarantee scheme model, to ensure that Australia's research and development expenditure continues to rise to a level approaching that existing in Japan, Switzerland, the United States and Germany. The situation is serious enough to move into pump priming by increased expenditure on public transport, public housing, education and scientific research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> But, as important as these measures are, they need to be supplemented by initiatives which enable at least some of the million or so Australians now on the scrap heap to move back into jobs quickly. Here the Democrats propose the community work program. This would be administered by local government and would be based on unemployed people in receipt of unemployment benefits carrying out labour intensive work at community level for pensioners, people with disabilities, hospitals, child-care centres and conservation projects. Unemployment benefits would be supplemented by an additional hourly payment to bring the total remuneration to award levels plus a margin for the administrative costs of local government. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, it is clear that social security provisions would have to be amended and that unions would have to be pacified. But that surely could be achieved in the face of the crisis in which we find ourselves. Surely one million unemployed, and 27 per cent unemployment among young people, can justify some administrative adjustments that we can make, provided we have the political will. This model was submitted to the Government as long ago as 1983. The then Minister for Social Security, Mr Don Grimes, submitted it to his Department. Unfortunately, the 1984 election stopped work on it and it has been forgotten ever since. It is now time that the responsible Ministers, Senator Richardson and Mr Dawkins, again look to a scheme of this nature to get people back to work. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to economic matters and to medium term strategies. These must include an overhaul of our education system with higher expenditure on buildings, equipment and teacher training and, most importantly, a substantial increase in the qualifications, professional dedication and, indeed, all-round quality and performance of our teachers and lecturers. </PARA>
<PARA> Readers of Tim Colebatch's article in the Age of 19 February and of a more recent article by Peter Smark, also in the Age, both detailing the performance and results of the German education system, will appreciate why the Democrats consider these proposals have such a high priority. The German economy can offer two other examples. Manufacturers spend five times as much on research, and worker participation in Germany is a reality, creating a partnership between labour and capital which shows results. In 1985, Germany lost 34,000 working days. The Australian economy, a quarter of the size, lost 1,256,200 working days. Germany shares with other successful economies, such as Japan, a strategic approach to the fostering of key industries with the potential to increase their exports and to develop employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that Australia adopted a strategic support approach for industry sectors capable of significant expansion utilising our competitive advantages. One of these sectors would be environmental technology. Dr John Stocker, the Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, recently detailed the advantages and the head start that we possess in this industry. The areas include pollution control technology; technology for assessing and managing the environment; repairing environmental damage; development of alternative energy sources; and recycling. </PARA>
<PARA> The second industry that the Australian Democrats would name as an industry worthy of further development would be tourism. Inbound tourism is Australia's premier export industry. It is the biggest single earner of foreign exchange in the nation, accounting for 9 per cent of Australia's total export earnings. Last financial year it contributed more than $6 billion of Australia's export revenue ahead of coal, wool, iron ore and wheat. Over the past 35 years, inbound tourism has grown at an average rate of 13.5 per cent a year, faster than any other Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, manufacturing generally should concentrate on value added production for products such as wool-and this is not an advertisement for Mr Jeff Kennett. Developing manufacturing sectors for the environmental technology industry and industries such as wine and food products should be further encouraged, given growing international demand for pollution-free produce. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should consider tax incentives such as long term accelerated depreciation, which I have mentioned before, to provide certainty and encouragement for investment. We should examine other possible incentives provided by some of our international competitors-for instance, a five-year tax exemption for 50 per cent of export income. We should target infrastructure expenditure to industry sectors which are capable of picking up the sort of initiatives that I have detailed. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen in the last few weeks a distinct change in the climate of the environment of our commerce and industry leaders. I refer to an article in the Australian of 30 April where Mr Douglas Brass, the Managing Director of Pacific Dunlop Ltd, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> ``But I am talking about sector winners-mining and energy-let's try and attract investment into those to add value. </PARA>
<PARA> ``A worry is that our Government has shown itself to be very much persuaded by trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In Malaysia, they looked at rubber, put an export tax on raw rubber and gave tax incentives to manufacturers so all of a sudden you have the price of rubber coming down because of the export tax and giving credit back to people who add value. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on the article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brass said exceptionally high tariffs were a problem for Australia as an exporter but said no tariffs meant that unless micro-reforms took place, there would be a manufacturing industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear that we cannot proceed along the lines that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) outlined when he said that, no matter what our competitors do, we will lie back and reduce our tariff protection totally and allow other people's products to come into Australia when our own manufacturers are suffering from the Government's inaction and from the Government's and the Opposition's adherence to the gospel of free market ideology, which takes account of no values, which shrugs its shoulders when we have one million people and 27 per cent of our young people unemployed. It is time that we changed. It is time that the Government took action to target our economy into activities which realise the goals and aspirations of ordinary Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1990-91, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91 to comment particularly on aspects of Government policies in relation to the accord with the trade unions. Before I turn to that point, I wish to make some brief comments about some of the issues that Senator Spindler raised with us in debate in the chamber today and yesterday. Senator Spindler spoke about some changes in the tax policies which he felt were appropriate. I have raised the issue of the Australian Democrats tax policies in this chamber before and have been subjected to fairly vigorous exchanges from the Democrat senators on my left-hand side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past I have suggested that the Democrats were in favour of wealth taxes, a capital gains tax on the family home, higher income taxes and death duties. Yesterday, Senator Lees took me to task on this, as indeed did Senator Bell. Senator Bell took up this theme and argued, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention . . . of a capital gains tax on the family home. Anybody who can identify that as a Democrat policy has looked at policies that certainly I have never taken part in promoting . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Bell said yesterday. I would have to say to Senator Bell, as indeed I would have to say to Senator Lees and to Senator Spindler, who is in the chamber at present, that I have checked the comments that I made last night and every word I said is accurate. I suggest that Senator Lees and Senator Spindler read their own policies more carefully. In particular, I refer them to the policy entitled `Australian Democrats, the sustainable economy', which was issued by the Democrats' national executive in January 1990. This is what the Democrats' policy says on the issue of wealth taxes: an annual low level wealth tax will be introduced, an inheritance tax will be introduced, and there will be a capital gains tax on residential property where the value exceeds $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy also talks about additional, rapidly progressive taxation on high incomes. Everything I said yesterday about the Democrats' tax policy was correct. I was a bit surprised that when I left the chamber I was subjected to fairly vigorous debate from Senator Spindler, who was clearly unhappy with my comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Spindler now says that these taxes apply only to wealthy people, that this vast range of Australian Democrats taxes apply only to wealthy people. I question whether that is in fact the case. Last night Senator Lees and Senator Bell spent a considerable time explaining that people can be asset rich yet income poor. It is more than probable that the people to whom Senator Lees and Senator Bell were referring, people who are suffering because of the assets test on Austudy, could in fact be hit by the Democrats wealth taxes. It is unlikely that Senator Spindler could stand up here and say that my comments in this regard were inaccurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To take another example: the Democrats policy itself says that capital gains tax is payable on an inherited residence. This is either a death duty or a capital gains tax. Senator Spindler can take his pick, but it applies to any property, whether it is worth $50,000 or $500,000. This is why people are nervous about the Democrats' tax policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already explained to Senator Spindler how such Democrats taxes would not tax just millionaires. The capital gains tax on the inherited family home, which he supports, applies to properties of any value, ranging from $50,000 to $500,000. The Australian Democrats have their tax policies and, fair enough, they are entitled to them. They should certainly stand by them and defend them, but when I get up in the chamber and refer to these issues they should not pretend that what I am raising is not accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been very careful to read the Democrats' policy documents. I do not believe that Senator Spindler's interpretation of those policies is correct. I believe that those taxes can apply to people on lower incomes, people not in the millionaire class, and, of course, this is contradictory to the Democrats' policies on Austudy. The Democrats have already explained to us how people can be asset rich and income poor. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude my comments on the policies of the Australian Democrats, I think that what should happen is that Senator Lees, Senator Bell, Senator Spindler and Senator McLean should sit down and work out whether they have a pro-rural policy, which Senator Lees seems to be arguing for, or a policy that contains elements that would affect adversely rural families and rural industries. I would be very happy to debate that issue with Senator Spindler at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Government's policies. I refer first to what is, perhaps, the central policy-the accord. I might point out that the Australian Democrats support the accord. Of course, the Australian Democrats keep going around and telling us that we have policies that are absolutely identical to those of the Government. Senator Spindler has said that many times in this chamber. However, when we look, for example, at one of the great arms of economic policy-industrial relations-we wonder whether Senator Spindler can stand up in this chamber and say that our policies are the same as the Government's. Of course he cannot. No one believes that that is the case. In relation to senators being accurate in their contributions to debates in this chamber, I think that Senator Spindler might look carefully at the way he expresses a comparison between the Government's policies and coalition policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, you have not said that in the past, Senator Spindler. Senator Spindler has been saying that our policies are, to all intents and purposes, identical to those of the Government. On the central issue of economic policy, the accord, there could not be a more fundamental difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to note that the Estimates Committee F report suggested that we must have better performance indicators on various industrial relations policies. The Committee wanted the Department to be more effective in judging the effectiveness of new policy initiatives and movements in wages and salaries, brought about by government policy changes and landmark decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC). I was pleased to see that the Committee recommends that the Department focus its efforts on developing more effective measures of outcomes, as opposed to measures of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a most important recommendation from the Committee. After all, I think there have been too many sacred cows in the whole area of industrial relations. Institutional arrangements, such as centralised wage fixing, the accord and large trade unions are not valued for their own intrinsic merit; they are valued for the way in which they can lead to improvements in living standards, economic development, justice and equity. I think we can be grateful to Senator Spindler for at least one thing-namely, for bringing to our attention the failure of the Government's policies in relation to the critical issue of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the outcomes, what sort of things do we look at? Senator Spindler was right to mention the matter of rising unemployment. We would like to see, for example, what productivity growth has been like under the accord. I ask Senator Spindler and Senator Bolkus: what has happened in regard to the balance of payments deficit and the foreign debt? How have they progressed under the accord? What has happened-and this is an issue that concerns Senator Spindler as well as myself-to distribution of income? Are micro reforms being achieved? Senator Spindler pointed out to us that he thought that at least some of them were not being achieved. I will be very interested to see how Senator Spindler votes when we get proposals from the Government on the third runway and for a variety of new pulp mills. We will look anxiously over our left shoulders to see whether those are the sorts of micro-reforms that Senator Spindler had in mind. We will be looking at that in a most interested fashion indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, there is no doubt that the accord is, in a sense, the sacred and the central economic tool of this Government. The accord is an agreement between the trade union movement and the Government. The accord, as Martin Ferguson has told us--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Mr Martin Ferguson has told us, the accord is part and parcel of this Government. I think this is quite an extraordinary statement but also an accurate statement. There is no question that the trade union movement is part and parcel of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sorts of measures that I have mentioned are relevant in measuring the effectiveness of the accord, but the bottom line for most families is what has happened to their living standard. I think that is a fair enough measure. The typical Australian perhaps does not focus in the way that we do on things like micro-reform but thinks of what has happened to his living standard, what has happened to his job and whether he is likely to hold onto his job in this climate or whether he is likely to join the growing queues of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook has spent a considerable amount of time in this chamber attempting to justify the accord with the trade union movement on the basis of outcomes. There is less talk these days from Senator Cook on such matters as economic growth and its natural partner, job growth. The figures that were released last week show that unemployment has risen to over 10 per cent. Some are predicting that it could rise to 12 per cent or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook still continues to defend the accord and its outcomes. In a speech last week in this chamber, Senator Cook pointed out that this Government is about creating a framework which enables moderate wage outcomes to be achieved and which enables-and this is the important point-living standards in the broader community to be protected. I have spoken before in the chamber-and Senator Faulkner will certainly remember this-on the issue of living standards and how we measure living standards. Do we use average weekly earnings or such measures as household disposable incomes?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook has been very vigorous in telling us that we should be measuring household disposable incomes per capita. According to Senator Cook, that is the central measure of living standards in the community. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may recall that on a number of occasions last year Senator Cook was asked-by Senator McKiernan on one occasion and Senator Childs on another; and I have no doubt that if Senator Faulkner could read a question he would probably have been given one too- `What has happened to household disposable incomes?'. That would be the sort of question asked. Senator Bolkus may be interested to know that I have not heard any such questions this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook replied to such questions with a fairly standard brief: when looking at the well-being of families, real household disposable income per capita is the real test. One wonders why we have not had any of those questions recently. I ask Senator Bolkus whether it is because household disposable income has perhaps taken a serious fall. If I was asked that question by Senator Bolkus, I would have to reply, `You are right, household disposable income is falling, and falling sharply'. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the question from Senator McKiernan just six months ago, which I mentioned earlier, Senator Cook said that household disposable income had risen by 11 per cent since the start of this Government in contrast to the Fraser years, when growth was somewhat lower. He said that that figure was probably around 7 per cent. The question to be asked six months later is: what has happened to household disposable income since the start of the Hawke Government? I can tell Senator Faulkner and Senator Bolkus that household income has not increased by 11 per cent since the advent of the Hawke Government; household disposable income has increased only by 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That explains why we have had no questions to Senator Cook on the central issue of living standards. What is of fundamental concern to a Labor member of Parliament? Perhaps I am being somewhat naive, but I would have thought that the fundamental concern of a Labor member of Parliament or a trade union leader would be what is happening to the living standards of Australian workers. In the last three quarters, we have had the most savage fall in household disposable incomes per capita since at least 1975. I followed the figures back to 1975 and could not go any further. Certainly, the fall we are seeing in family living standards is absolutely unprecedented. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than getting up and defending the accord day after day, I would have thought that Mr Martin Ferguson and Senator Cook would have started to show some concern. Indeed, one would have hoped that his back bench would have started to show some concern about what is happening to the living standards of Australian workers. The question could then be asked by Senator Faulkner-if he ever wanted to ask a question in this place- `You say, Senator Kemp, that living standards have risen by only 7 per cent since the advent of the Hawke Government. What is going to happen in the future?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that would be a very good question. I would very much welcome a Labor senator standing up in the chamber and putting that question to Senator Cook. From what I have seen and from what I can analyse, the prospects are particularly grim. In other words, that 7 per cent may continue to tumble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus should be interested in this because it is about the living standards of Australian workers. Why do I say that the prospects for living standards for Australian workers are particularly grim? Until the last two years-and this is very interesting because living standards started to fall in about 1988-the Government published forecasts of household disposable income in its Budget Papers. Senator Faulkner could get his Budget Papers, turn to the relevant table, and perhaps be comforted by the fact that the Government said that in the forthcoming year household disposable income was going to rise by a certain amount. If Senator Faulkner turned to the Budget Papers today, he would not find any reference to a forecast of household disposable income. I suggest to Senator Bolkus that the reason for this is simply that the forecast is grim, and rightly so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other aspect of the economy that makes us feel that household disposable income per capita and living standards will continue to fall is that unemployment is now rising and farm incomes are falling in a catastrophic fashion. Those two features will probably have a very adverse effect on household disposable incomes in the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it comes as a surprise to me and to the great proportion of supporters of Senator Faulkner and Senator Bolkus, who are great men of the Left-the big men of the Left who are present in the chamber-that they, above all, should have evinced some concern about what has happened to the living standards of Australian workers under their accord. It was very interesting that today Mr Martin Ferguson, on the radio program A.M.--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask Senator Faulkner whether he listened to Comrade Ferguson. When the trade union leader, the head of the peak council of trade unions in this country, was asked whether he could find anything critical to say about the Government, whether there was anything wrong with Government policy-this is the Government which has now created the worst recession since 1930, which has created the highest foreign debt in our history, which has given us record interest rates and record bankruptcies and which has policies that day by day are throwing Australian workers out of jobs- he said that nothing was wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the history of this period is written-and it will start to be written fairly soon-we will be able to evaluate, with the advantage of hindsight, thank God, the performance of Ministers such as Senator Bolkus and deputy whips such as Senator Faulkner, and what they did in this last decade. We will evaluate what they did for Australian workers and for Australian families. I suggest that historians will ask this question: why did the Labor Party persevere with a policy that destroyed the employment prospects and living standards of the Australian worker? There is no argument about that now. Living standards and employment prospects have collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer that I think historians will give, which will condemn Senator Bolkus and Senator Faulkner and their colleagues, is that Senator Cook and his colleagues gave a priority to policies which benefited trade union leaders, not trade union members. Mr Martin Ferguson, the comrade of Senator Faulkner, in his defence of government policies over the last nine years, has demonstrated that the interests of union leaders and union members are not one and the same. Senator Bolkus and Senator Faulkner will pay a very heavy price for what they have done to the living standards of Australian workers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the seven minutes remaining before the dinner recess, after which I shall resume my remarks at 8 p.m., I wish to outline some of the things I would like to address in the course of my speech on the Appropriation Bills. At the outset I would like to talk generally about the state of the nation as it is, left to us by the hands of the likes of the Ministers who sit across the way. These Appropriation Bills are evidence of the collapse of the Government's fiscal strategy. Let us consider that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) passed this Parliament only months before a Bill of its kind generally would. We then had the passage of a loans Bill, the first of its kind since 1987. This meant that for the first time in a number of years the Government found that the amount in the consolidated revenue fund was insufficient to meet the ongoing expenditure requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It used to be regarded as a simple mechanism for making the books balance. For years we had a Treasurer who trumpeted loud and wide that we did not require that strategy or mechanism because his budgeting skills were so great that there was sufficient surplus for it not to be necessary. However, this year has seen the true state of the nation and once again it required the passage of a loans Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are witnessing the expenditure of a blowout born of the Government's policy-induced recession. According to the Government tax revenue estimates, every area of Government revenue is now well behind original Budget forecasts. I think it is worth while seeing where those shortfalls lie. Net pay as you earn (PAYE) collections in the eight months to February are said to be $1.65 billion behind Budget estimates. This reflects a $1.384 billion reduction in estimated PAYE collections, and a blowout of $266m in PAYE funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those figures are so horrendous that one could expect them to be etched in the minds of many Australians. However, to make sure they are accurate, they are written down. Indeed, in terms of the human suffering of people who are no longer in a position to make a PAYE payment because they no longer have a job, I hope that the Minister has the good grace to look shamefaced when he realises that those reductions in revenue represent crushed lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Company tax receipts are down by at least $377m from a Budget estimate of $10.041 billion. Withholding tax receipts are down $62m, while sales tax receipts have fallen by $614m. It should be remembered that these figures are based on only eight months to February, and are bound to be much worse for the full financial year. Again, let us look at those PAYE receipts for the full financial year which will be down $3 billion, while sales tax receipts are expected to be down by some $1 billion. In all, the total revenue has been predicted as being short of the budgeted forecasts by a massive $4.4 billion. On the outlays side, expenditure in the current financial year is expected to blow out by between $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion. Again, those figures simply tell the tale of the tragedy that has been forced on the Australian people by a Government which personally designed a recession which it said we had to have. What a mockery it makes of the Government's flaunted big budget surpluses in recent times. They were a fraud from the start and they are a fraud at the finish. They were a fraud in that they were financed by bracket creep, high taxes and massive cuts in payments to the States. In short, the Government has simply misled the Australian people in proclaiming those surpluses in that it took from the States and effectively gave itself a rise in the section of the income tax dollar which it commandeered to itself by over 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has consistently called on the Government to adopt a strategy to curb inflation, which has become a fundamental problem in the Australian economy but, when it came to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), our words landed on deaf ears. Mr Keating refused to accept that inflation reduction had to become the prime macro-economic policy goal of the nation. But guess what? In November last there was yet another conversion on the road to Damascus. Confronted with a near satisfactory consumer price index outcome for the September quarter, the Treasurer had seized on the figure as being an economic policy success for the Government, but someone forgot to tell him that the figure was consequent on a virtual collapse in asset prices. A price freeze on petrol had little more than a side effect of his deliberately engineered recession. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, Opposition members did tell him. He simply did not bother to listen. One does not have to be the world's greatest Treasurer to appreciate that if one creates the environment in which 750,000 workers are thrown onto the dole queues and where a record number of businesses are forced to go bankrupt, there will not be some sort of trade-off with lower inflation. If the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has set the Government a 4 per cent inflation target, one wonders what is in store for those workers lucky enough still to have jobs or those firms that are not in the red. For this Government there is no reason to gloat over lower inflation figures. Again, they represent the pain that has been inflicted unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of inducing lower inflation with the recession, it should have come about through improved labour market flexibility where wage rises were the product of productivity improvement, and not the farce we have seen in what has passed for an acceptable so-called wages policy and the late lamented accord. It should also not be forgotten that the only free policy arm of government in recent years has been monetary policy. With the interaction of the wage-tax trade-off, the fastening together of fiscal and wages policy has been to impose the bulk of the burden of aggregated demand restraint onto monetary policy. What a blunt instrument it has turned out to be. The Government has grossly overestimated the required changes to monetary policy to bring about its outcomes. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the sitting was suspended for dinner at 6.30 p.m. I was dealing with the total mismanagement of the economy by this present Government. I was dealing specifically with the way in which the monetary policy had been used. I was about to make the point that, clearly, what we require is a much better attitude and a better policy with regard to an independent central bank, armed with the brief that its main purpose is to control inflation and, indeed, the tool for achieving that would be monetary policy. That, in turn, now leads me to the knowledge that when a government gets out of touch with reality, as this one has, there is a tendency that many of its public servants will do likewise. It is this sort of thing that we discover when we go to the Estimates committees hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say right at the outset that the Estimates committees are but a part of the whole system of scrutiny which is conducted to allow the expenditure of public money, and those who spend it, to be accountable to the Parliament. There are, of course, committees such as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of scrutiny, such as the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. There is, of course, the linchpin in the whole of this operation, the Auditor-General. Indeed, the Public Accounts Committee brought down that now very well-known report entitled The Auditor General: Ally of the People and Parliament which describes very aptly the pivotal role which the Auditor-General holds in the whole question of scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, when we go to the Estimates committees hearings the material we look at is not only the program notes-the explanatory notes which accompany the documentation with which we deal-but also things such as annual reports and, indeed, the Auditor-General's reports. As we go through that process of scrutiny we find some officers in the Public Service who give straightforward and informative answers, and who attempt to assist the Committee in its deliberations. But we find, and have found over the years, others who obviously have no wish to cooperate with the committees or the committee system at all. Indeed, one could be pardoned for saying that some of them hold the Parliament in contempt. I take that attitude right back to the attitude that the Government holds. </PARA>
<PARA> On many occasions I have described this Government as being peopled with members and senators who hold no regard or feeling for the parliamentary tradition or, indeed, the knowledge that it is the Parliament to whom executives and the Public Service must be accountable if we are to have a working democracy. If one looks at the Hansards of those Estimates committees hearings, and if one reads the reports and some of the answers that have been furnished, one will find that that unfortunate attitude does prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> But quite an interesting thing occurs. After matters have been raised it is by no means an uncommon occurrence for people such as myself and other honourable senators to receive telephone calls, letters or documentation from people who have either read a report of what has transpired or, indeed, read the Hansard itself, and have felt that they could add something to the debate with the knowledge that is peculiar to them. As usual, following this series of Estimates committees hearings exactly that process has taken place. Tonight in my contribution to the second reading debate I intend to touch on some of the things with which we dealt in Estimates Committee A, one or two matters which were dealt with in Estimates Committee B and flag that, when we come to the Committee of the Whole, many questions will be pursued as a result of further information that has come to hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with the Estimates Committee A report, some of the more important issues with which we dealt come early in it. The first one was the question of parliamentary security-something which has had a good deal of attention again in the last few days. The public, when they read about, and are informed of what is happening, by way of stories that are written or interviews which are given on radio and television-which, presumably, under the Government's new legislation would be banned; at least for the electronic media-show that they are quite angered by the cavalier attitude that prevails. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with parliamentary security we had certain examples of the way that that security is lax. We also saw when the subject was broached that, firstly, there was a not clear understanding of where authority lies-of who should make the final decisions; and, secondly, there was a complacency about the way in which security is administered. </PARA>
<PARA> The security in this building costs the taxpayers several millions of dollars and yet the evidence that was given in the Estimates Committee hearing itself was highly unsatisfactory. We have recorded in the report the farcical-indeed, shall we say Monty Pythonesque-situation whereby somebody was caught in the act of stealing. The police were called and declined to lay charges; an internal committee inquiry was held; that person was sacked; that person appealed; and that person is now a security officer again. As a result of that coming out, more information has come to hand and we will deal with that when we come to the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clerk of the Senate said that this was a matter of grave concern, but the question is: what sort of messages are we sending out? In this place it is quite common that people who have things stolen from their offices do not even bother to report it. The reason they do not bother to report it is that they feel it is pointless because nothing will happen about it. </PARA>
<PARA> When a very valuable painting in this building was damaged-as it was during that notorious party held by the Treasurer, Mr Keating-we had a security officer whose idea of a follow-up investigation was to interview 12 people and say, `It's all too hard, I can't solve it'. He then sent the bill for the conservation attention that the painting required, not to the Treasurer personally, but to the Department of the Treasury. A further bill for $50, which was discussed in the Supplementary Estimates, to continue the inspection of that painting to see whether its condition had deteriorated was, again, sent to the Department, not to the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> The messages we send out are that the security in this place is lax; that, really, one can get away with anything; and that the sorts of things that occur are the sorts of things that happen, in a very pertinent way, to people on this side of the House in that a video recorder was stolen from the party room of the Opposition and nobody turned a hair. Larger items have walked out of here and if we had a better security system in place something could be done about it. I really want to see some attention given to the problem, some plan of action devised and some propositions put to the Presiding Officers so that there will be an examination of what is a better way in which to conduct the security of this building. Tonight, I have not even touched upon the incident of the Iraqi diplomat who was free to walk around this building during the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> We then dealt with question of the Governor-General's overseas trip. The rationale for a trip that encompassed Rome, London, New York and Hawaii was basically that it was an economy measure to buy an around the world ticket instead of a straight Sydney to London ticket, which would have enabled the Governor-General to have his discussion with the Queen. The saving of buying such a ticket would be $2,500 to $3,000 per passenger travelling first class. Presumably the Governor-General and Mrs Hayden were accompanied by an entourage, but I do not know the numbers involved. We have asked for details of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it quite an interesting set of arithmetic that says that, to save $6,000, we should take in three other capital cities, with the associated accommodation and various other associated charges. It may well be that it is important for the Governor-General to go on a visit to the centres of Rome, New York and Hawaii. The answers we were given are recorded in the Hansard and I shall leave it for others to judge whether they were sufficiently important to be included. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to a very serious matter-the way in which the Auditor-General is regarded by at least one very senior officer of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC). I find this sort of attitude almost reprehensible. It is the sort of attitude that places that whole system of scrutiny at risk. The Auditor-General reported in his report that officers within DITAC had first applied for an advance to the Minister for Finance in order that a particular bill could be paid. The Minister for Finance rejected that application. What did the Department then do? It took money out of another appropriation and spent that money on something for which the appropriation was not made; that is, an illegal payment was made. The law was broken-both the Constitution and the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA> What response do we get to that? We heard Dr Bell say, `We have a genuine difference of opinion with the AuditorGeneral'. `There are often differences between the departments and the Auditor-General and this is just one'. `It is a technicality'. `Mistakes do happen'. That is just not good enough. There was a brighter side to that story and that was that the Department of Finance, on seeing and hearing what occurred in that hearing, contacted DITAC and administered what can only be interpreted as a reprimand. That is a very serious occurrence. If the departments and the officers in those departments do not acknowledge that the Auditor-General has found a most important breach and dismiss it as a technicality, the whole system of scrutiny and accountability starts to break down. That is exactly the sort of situation we had in the inquiry into the Parliamentary Information Systems Office which came before this place some months ago and was investigated by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on reference from the Senate. The finding was that more illegalities had taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> A pleasing result of that matter is that certain secretaries of departments have taken that matter very much in hand and do instruct their employees that they are public servants; that they are covered by the Public Service Act; that they are concerned with the Audit Act and the Crimes Act and, of course, the Constitution; and that they are in no way immune or exempt from complying with the law. One would have thought that was axiomatic. But, quite clearly, what has crept into the culture is that some people think they are above the law. It just will not do. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to another serious occurrence in Austrade. It was quite late at night when we dealt with Austrade. We dealt with a fraud which had been perpetrated on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) of $16m. We heard evidence that this was a very clever con trick which had been perpetrated against EFIC in which $16m of what was effectively taxpayers' money had been successfully siphoned off. From there we went onto a case of the building of a boat for one Mr Cantor in Queensland, where a loan of $8m at 8 per cent for eight years was made by EFIC to Mr Cantor to build a boat. We then heard that Mr Cantor was subsequently arrested and charged with defrauding the United States Federal Bureaucracy Trustee of more than $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> In questioning about the $16m scam, my colleague Senator Short had asked the General Manager of EFIC whether with hindsight it had put in place better scrutiny so that it would not be defrauded again. Dr Fisher went on to assure Senator Short and the Committee that much better mechanisms were in place that would ensure that would not happen again. I then asked Dr Fisher whether with the new mechanisms in place he could assure me that the likes of Mr Cantor, who is known to have affiliations with the Mafia, would not get in the door. I got no such assurance. I was simply told that he was paying his bills. I ultimately got a statement that the arrest took place after the agreement had been entered into and therefore could not really have been taken account of. </PARA>
<PARA> The worrying aspect of that-and we will have more questions to ask in the Committee of the Whole-is that I have had more information; that is, that the arrest took place in May 1987 but the contract was not signed until October 1987. In fact, the contract was signed after Mr Cantor had been arrested. Dr Fisher did not seem to be particularly worried that an arrest was a determining factor because there was no conviction. My point is that Mr Cantor is not the sort of person we would expect a public authority to be lending taxpayers' money to. </PARA>
<PARA> But the story does not end there. The sum involved is not $8m; it is more like $16m. As well as the $8m payment, I am informed-and we shall ask questions and ascertain whether it is true-that, in addition to the $8m loan, DITAC made a bounty payment of $3m; that the company building the boat raised and expended $2.5m because the architect of the boat made changes and that $2.5m was guaranteed by EFIC; and that, when the company went bust, because of the changes that were perpetually made by Mr Cantor, EFIC had to pay out another $2.5m. Then there was the form of a performance bond which was entered into to underwrite the boat builder's performance and the creditors were owed a further $2.5m. So we paid out another $2.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> The company itself believed that it had a good claim of $6m which could be pursued by the liquidator. But guess what? It is not being pursued. The bottom line is that we have had Mr Cantor allegedly going around New York boasting that he has had a boat worth $25m built courtesy of the Australian Government, and that is where $16m has gone. I think Senator Richardson described former Premier Brian Burke as being guilty of sloppy administration. This is what I would call very sloppy administration, and when we come to the Committee of the Whole there are many questions along those lines that I will be wanting answers to. </PARA>
<PARA> We then move on to the Australian Customs Service, where we seem to have officers who have very bad memories appear before Estimates Committee A. I think honourable senators will recall that at the end of the last Estimates hearings, after the Budget, the Committee took a very long time to complete its inquiries, largely because again and again, particularly with DITAC and in dealing with program 2-the Australian Customs Service-we had answers such as, `I do not know', `I am not briefed on that' and so on. A tortuous path we had to traverse. </PARA>
<PARA> It has ended in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts investigating the Customs Service and its activities, an investigation which has been forestalled at the moment because of a request from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Subsequently, we will be able to discuss the reasons that the DPP asked for hearings not to be held and whether that was the way to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the Supplementary Estimates we again went along the path of finding the Customs Service unable to answer questions that were asked. We have now received lengthy answers-some of which are satisfactory and some of which are not. They are carefully couched in language designed to make us think one thing but which, if we probe a little further, we find means another. Again, we will be asking questions concerning that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing the second reading of the Appropriation Bills, we find the country in a pretty sad state. We have the former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, saying that we are in a depression. We have hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians out of work, in danger of losing their homes. We have people who have spent 20 years of their lives building businesses losing everything. We have a Treasurer (Mr Keating) who talks about beautiful numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> When we go to the detail of the manner in which the taxpayer's dollar is spent, we find that the cavalier attitude that is prevalent in the Government is reflected in too many of the people who come before those committees. Honourable senators should not get me wrong; there are very good members of the Public Service who appear at these committees-people who genuinely want to see the system work. This becomes very apparent when one is later asked to go to address meetings of people who really want to understand the accountability process more. That is very gladdening for the heart. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, at the end of this process, I can only say that it is a sorry state. But I hope, as we start to move forward, to see a new dawn-which must come with a new government-that there will be some hope for this land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dealing with the elements of the financial situation facing Australia at the moment and the horrendous unemployment, I raise another matter which I believe is of some concern. It relates to the Government's handling of, and the involvement of the Australian Labor Party in, the reception for the President of Turkey, Mr Ozal, and the demonstrations against Mr Ozal. In particular, I draw to the Senate's attention the manner in which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was basically abandoned by his Cabinet and by his Ministry at the State reception for Mr Ozal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also draw to the Senate's attention the fact that, to my certain knowledge, a member of the staff of a senior New South Wales Labor member of parliament was involved in organising protest rallies against the Turkish President. The member of Parliament whose staff member was involved was Mr Laurie Brereton. I have no position either way on the rights or wrongs of a member of Mr Brereton's staff doing whatever he likes in these matters provided, of course, they are not in breach of the law. It is up to Mr Brereton to determine whether it is proper for his staff member to become involved in the organising of such protests. I understand that there is a great deal of feeling among the communities in Australia whose origins are Greek, Armenian and Kurdish. But, that said, it is no doubt appropriate for Mr Brereton to dissociate himself from his staffer's activities if, in fact, Mr Brereton intends to be dissociated from those activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to the most extraordinary event that took place in this building at the official reception, the governmental reception, for the President of Turkey. I do not remember a head of state attending a formal dinner of this kind to find that 10 of the 17 members of the Cabinet were not present and that only two of the outer Ministry were present. In other words, a total of only nine out of 34 Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries attended a major function, a major reception, for the President, the head of state, of a friendly nation, who had just been invested with the Order of Australia by the Australian Prime Minister. It was an incredible situation. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more incredible is to note who of the Hawke Ministry did not attend the reception. I may as well start second from the top. I do not know what pressing engagement forced the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Keating, not to attend. One would have thought that a reception of this significance for a head of state would have encouraged the Deputy Prime Minister perhaps to miss whatever other appointment he had. There is no doubt, for example, that he certainly was not invited to participate in the New South Wales election on that day. The New South Wales Opposition, led by Mr Carr, has shown no interest at all in having any of the senior members of this Government assist it in its doomed venture to try to win power in New South Wales. I note, for example, that Mr Carr contrived to have the opening of his campaign on a day that Mr Hawke was, regrettably, unable to attend because of the sitting of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating was not there; Mr Duffy was not there; Mr Howe was not there; Dr Blewett, I think, was overseas and certainly was not there. Senator the Hon. Graham Frederick Richardson was not there-I underline that name. The Hon. Gerry Hand was not there; the Hon. Brian Howe was not there; Senator Peter Cook was not there; and Senator Nick Bolkus was not there-I could hardly have expected Senator Bolkus to attend in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of the outer Ministry who did not turn up were Senator Tate, Mr Staples, Mr Bob Brown, Mr David Simmons, Mr Peter Baldwin, Mr David Beddall, Mr Gordon Bilney, Senator Bob Collins, Mr Simon Crean, Ms Wendy Fatin, Mr Robert Tickner, Mr Ross Free, Senator McMullan, Mr Con Sciacca and Mr Warren Snowdon. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I particularly underlined Senator Richardson's name was that he joined a large group of senior Labor people from New South Wales who absented themselves from this most significant dinner for a head of state. Among others of that ilk who managed to avoid attending were the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr McLeay; Mr Brereton who, with Senator Richardson, is the well-known fishing mate of some Western Australian mates of the Prime Minister; Mrs Crosio and Mr Punch. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, looking through this list I wondered just how many of the Prime Minister's New South Wales supporters and mates actually did attend this dinner? I am not an expert in Labor Party cabals, but it seemed to me that very few of his group of intimate supporters in New South Wales attended the function. Clearly, these great supporters of Mr Hawke, his right-wing buddies in New South Wales, abandoned him on this occasion. By the way, I have just noticed that I missed out Senator Button; he also did not attend. The great bulk of the senior members of the Labor Party in this Parliament abandoned the Prime Minister on this occasion and so did his right-wing mates in New South Wales. They abandoned the Prime Minister because he made an awful mess of this whole situation; just the latest of the awful political messes that he has been making so frequently in recent times. The main members of the Labor Ministry were notable more by their absence than their presence at this reception. I must say I find it extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that everyone is of one mind on the difficulties between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus; I am not suggesting that these are not matters of some substance. I am not going into the merit of those matters. What I am going into the merit of is the insult accorded to a visiting head of state by the leading members of this Government not attending such a function. While that insult is a matter that the Turks can work out for themselves, maybe there is a political significance as well. </PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Hawke's right wing colleagues in Cabinet and in the outer Ministry and the backbenchers from New South Wales who help to keep him in office are prepared to abandon him in a situation like this, where they leave the Prime Minister exposed in a reception of this kind-clearly indicating their objection to his decision to honour the President of Turkey with the Order of Australia-then I wonder how committed they are to sticking with him on the leadership. I wonder when they are going to abandon him on that. It would seem to me that when one looks at absentees like Mr McLeay and Mr Brereton, for example, one wonders what the New South Wales operational heavyweights are up to; particularly when one adds Senator Richardson to that band. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that politically Mr Hawke's hopeless mismanagement of this matter has generated the quite proper response: the Turks are very unimpressed by the Prime Minister; the Greeks are also very unimpressed, as are the Armenians and the Kurds. Once again, he has demonstrated his remarkable ability to get everyone offside and drop the ball. One wonders how long such a Prime Minister is going to stay in office when he is so readily abandoned by his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish up by expressing my concern about the role of a staffer of one of the Prime Minister's colleagues in organising demonstrations against Mr Ozal, particularly when I understand that the staffer expressed concern that it would cost something like $25,000 to organise the Canberra demonstration. I wonder who paid that $25,000. I wonder whether Mr Brereton can assist us in explaining what really happened. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, this question of absence from the function in the Great Hall of this Parliament just reminds me of the fact that when this Parliament House was officially opened by the Queen two years ago there was a major function to which members of parliament were invited and we sat in the Great Hall to participate in that ceremony. However, former distinguished parliamentarians such as Senator Carrick, who was Leader of the Government in this place, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle, a very distinguished Minister in this place for many years and a whole range of former Ministers were excluded from the Great Hall during that ceremony so that the friends of the Prime Minister could attend-his fishing mates from Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knowles is correct and it is quite wrong that that is the case. The next matter I want to deal with relating to mates is the scandalous situation in Victoria where the Australian Council of Trade Unions engaged in clear, uncomplicated blackmail of Tennis Australia as to whether there should have been demonstrations at the last national open. There was a question as to whether that blackmail would be pursued through the courts. The Herald-Sun has been running very properly a dramatic series of exposures on this issue. I am astounded to see that a decision has been taken by the Victorian Government not to prosecute anyone over the affair. This was a case of clear, uncomplicated blackmail. A demand was made on Tennis Australia for a $10,000 donation in exchange for peace at this year's Australian Open. I referred to this incident at the time in this place as blackmail. As the Herald-Sun says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . there was an attempt to get Tennis Australia to hand over a $10,000 donation to the National Olympic Sports Congress of South Australia in exchange for a guarantee that the Australian Open would not be disrupted by anti-apartheid demonstrations. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . the president of Tennis Australia, Mr Geoff Pollard, said the demand was made first at a face to face meeting with him by the president of the ACTU, Mr Martin Ferguson, the Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Mr John Halfpenny-</PARA>
<PARA>I think he is now a former mate. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>and a spokesman for the Anti-Apartheid Movement (Vic), Mr David Howes. This verbal demand was followed by a letter making the same demand. It was written on ACTU letterhead and was signed by Messrs Ferguson and Howes. Mr Halfpenny's name was also typed at the bottom of the letter, but he had not signed it. </PARA>
<PARA>It is astounding that the Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria, Mr Kel Glare, announced 10 days or so ago a police decision not to prosecute following legal advice from the Victorian Government Solicitor. But he would not reveal the detail of the Victorian Government Solicitor's advice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the National Party in Victoria, Mr McNamara, in a letter to Mr Glare, has claimed that the prosecuting police recommended prosecution, which was not proceeded with. As the Herald-Sun says, this brings us to the most puzzling aspect of the affair. </PARA>

<PARA> . . . why, as seems the case, did Mr Glare not forward the papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions, rather than the Victorian Government Solicitor? Or if Mr Glare did so, what did the DPP say?</PARA>
<PARA>The reason the Herald-Sun is quite right in raising this matter is because the office of the DPP was established soon after Mr Cain came to power in Victoria, before he started to dig a hole both for himself and for his State. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA>It had long been his aim to remove the decision on prosecutions in indictable offences from the political process. As he remarked when he created the post in 1982: ` `In the UK, the concept puts it outside the government.''</PARA>
<PARA>I totally agree with the conclusions of the Herald-Sun. If there was ever an argument for ensuring that strict impartiality was being maintained, the Tennis Australia affair, involving as it does political figures, is a glaring example. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>A former chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, Mr Col Lovitt, QC, declares himself ``mystified'' by Mr Glare's rationale. He believes, as we do, that the process by which the police decision against prosecution was reached must be spelt out in detail in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>More and more, the matter of mates is expressing itself in different ways. Let us have a look at what mates are doing to the Australian economy. Earlier this evening we heard Senator Maguire having what could politely be described as a go at me; he beat me with a feather. He claimed that I had misled the Parliament on sales tax. He withdrew the word `misled' when he realised-not as a result of any pressure from this side of the House-that he was talking absolute rubbish. This Treasurer has ceased to express an interest in his old plan for a broadly based consumption tax, because it is self-evidently true that he has largely introduced one by stealth. I have often said in this place that we have plenty of evidence of that in the extended sales tax, which is a consumption tax by another name. The consumption tax has been extended to foods like ice cream and orange juice. Is orange juice not a food? It has also been extended to include flavoured milk, confectionary and wine-and so it goes on; there is quite a list. Certainly this tax is not on all foods; I have never claimed that it was. Senator Maguire must be in some dreamland. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said-and it is evident from the facts; Mr Keating has said it himself-that the scope available for a consumption tax when he was pushing it some years ago is not there because of the way he has extended the taxation system. He has extended it, all right, particularly into consumption taxes. I waited, with no result, for Senator Maguire to express a view-I have been saying this consistently-on the curious set of priorities this Government has when it is prepared to tax kids' orange juice and ice cream and flavoured milk but is not prepared to tax pornographic magazines. Apparently, that situation suits Senator Maguire. If that is this Government's order of priorities, they are wrong; it is indefensible. The whole sales tax regime at the moment represents that kind of ad hoc, unreasonable, unfair and ludicrous set of priorities that this Government apparently holds dear. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see the extent to which Senator Maguire's pathetic defence of the Government falls apart. Let us have a look at the evidence of the huge increase in consumption taxes under Mr Keating. There are quite a few: for example, excise. The Fraser Government raised something like $3.49 billion in sales tax. This year, this Government has budgeted to raise $10.67 billion in sales tax. Sales tax has more than trebled during this Government's term of office whereas the total taxation revenue has increased only-the word `only' is unfortunate-by about 134 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result sales tax, which used to make up only about 8.5 per cent of total Government taxation revenue, now makes up 11.1 per cent. Here we have the steady expansion of the consumption tax that this Treasurer has tried to tell us he is opposed to introducing and that the Government would not have a bar of. He does it by stealth instead. Ask the kids whose orange juice and ice-cream are now being taxed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Michael Baume, in his usual lucid style, said it is wrong for the Victorian Government to decide not to take action against certain unionists, including Mr John Halfpenny and Mr Martin Ferguson. He said it would be wrong for governments to take action on a particular bias. I could not agree more. It would be wrong for a government or government authorities to take action against people based on bias. I agree wholeheartedly that any government decision based on bias would be wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not sure how Senator Baume relates those propositions to what is happening in Victoria because no decision has been taken by the Victorian Government not to take action. As Senator Baume said, the decision was taken by the Victoria Police Force. You, Madam Acting Deputy President, like myself, are from Victoria. I do not know whether you can think of any instance where it has been alleged that the Chief Commissioner of Police, Mr Kel Glare, is in any way influenced by the Government; I certainly cannot. Indeed, his reputation in Victoria would be to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> I think specifically of his approach at the appropriate time that a suspect can be held in custody before being charged. It differed, at times at least, from the approach of the Victorian Government. In making that decision, the police-I am sure it would not have been Mr Glare himself who made the decision-were acting no differently from the way they do in any instance where people are investigated for an alleged crime. The procedure is that the police investigate and, if the police think it appropriate, charge the person. </PARA>
<PARA> If the charge is for an indictable offence, as it was in this case, the crime of blackmail, the person concerned is put through committal proceedings. At the committal proceedings, if the magistrate decides on the evidence-usually uncontradicted at a committal-that a properly instructed jury could reasonably come to a verdict of guilty, the person is committed. Only at that point is the matter sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are instances where the Director of Public Prosecutions can put somebody on trial without the matter going to a committal but that is an unusual procedure. It would be unfair if these two men, Mr Ferguson and Mr Halfpenny, were treated differently from the ordinary citizen. Some propositions have been put that if people have a special status they should be treated in a special adverse way. Mr Temby was of that view some years ago but he has now moved away from that position. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems harsh to take the Victorian Government to task for simply carrying out the law. The police obtained an opinion from the Victorian Solicitor-General, Mr Hartog Berkley. He is a public servant and not a political figure in the same way that the Attorney-General is. He is a very eminent member of the Victorian Bar Council where he has a high reputation. I have not heard him criticised in any way for dishonesty, nor has it ever been suggested that he is corrupt. He has given advice to the police in the normal course of his duties. I simply point that out because, unfortunately, it is very often the case these days that people are maligned and blackguarded and their reputation reduced on the basis of a misunderstanding of what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not for one minute suggest that Senator Michael Baume has in any way spoken maliciously tonight. He has taken from the Herald-Sun in Melbourne an account of what has occurred in respect of Mr Ferguson and Mr Halfpenny in relation to the last Australian Open Tennis Tournament. That paper has pursued a course which, on the face of it at least, is quite vindictive. Whereas Senator Baume has every excuse in the world for not going into the details of the way these things end up in court-if they do so end up-and whereas he is reasonable in relying on the Herald-Sun in what it has written, the same cannot be said for the paper. It does have access to legal advice and it has had time to analyse this. For it to write the editorials it has, and to have written up this incident as it has, does not leave it with a great deal of credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Herald-Sun said that a different decision should have been made. We all say that different decisions should have been made about many things, but in a society like this we have to accept the proper authorities and the decisions they make. So long as the procedures that have been adopted which lead to the decision being made are legitimate and have been properly used, that is the correct decision by definition. The way the decision was reached in respect of both Mr Halfpenny and Mr Ferguson was the correct way. As the law says, they have been left without any stain on their characters. The golden thread running through the common law-which we all accept-is that everybody is innocent until proved guilty. In this case, the evidence against them was not even sufficient to go to a committal, much less to put them on trial. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the union movement generally, given the attacks that have been made on it. The movement has been blamed for the state of the economy-or a major part of the economy's problems have been attributed to it. In 1983, Australian non-primary industry was inward-looking and concerned overwhelmingly with the local market. It was ill-equipped to export overseas and unable to provide employment for the increasing numbers seeking work. Something had to be done so that in the long term this country could offer its citizens a secure, civilised and fair life. </PARA>
<PARA> Tremendous advances have been made in the last eight years. I say that, being fully conscious of the unhappy state of the economy in Australia at the moment. There has been a change in understanding, attitudes and goals, and a change in how one section of the community perceives the other. In the long term, the work done by the labour movement during the 1980s will be seen as one of the great shifts for the good in Australian industry. The relationship between government, management and the work force is much healthier now than it was a decade ago. That relationship must grow better, or at least remain as sound as it is now, if this country is to advance to that state we all want. </PARA>
<PARA> The risk that the coalition poses for Australia is the damage it will probably inflict on the relationship that presently exists between the work force, management and government. Capital and labour need to work together in a way that brings both equity and productivity. If only one of these is attended to, the other is likely to suffer. Where productivity becomes the sole target, equity is readily prejudiced. </PARA>
<PARA> Workers, with their unions, have made great sacrifices for their country in the last eight years. There has been a 10 per cent lowering in the real unit cost of labour since the accord began operating in 1983. Over the same period, the share of the national income going to profit has increased dramatically. In the last three full years of the Fraser Government, the number of working days lost per thousand employees through industrial disputes was 649 in 1980, 797 in 1981 and 348 in 1982. In the last three full years under this Government, the number of working days lost per thousand employees through industrial disputes has been 269 in 1988, 190 in 1989 and 216 in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is confidence between management, capital and workers and the labour they provide, then great things can be done. Clearly, workers are willing to make sacrifices and, in many cases, so is management, but mutual trust is essential, and sometimes that does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The now famous case of the Shepparton Preserving Co. Ltd is an example where the actions of management leave something to be desired. Because of the state of the industry in Shepparton at the time that the agreement was made between the workers and the company, things were bad. As a result of the agreement reached between the union, management and work force, seasonal workers lost $25.40 a week, three rostered days off and payment for unused sick-leave, which was usually two to three days; permanent workers gave away $60 to $80 a week, depending on the shift they were working, and three rostered days off; and the staff gave away 17.5 per cent loading on their annual leave, and that was all. </PARA>
<PARA> In January this year, management decided to give staff, as distinct from workers, a 5 per cent increase in pay. It might well have been that the 5 per cent increase was justified or it might have been otherwise but management sought to give it in a way that would avoid unfavourable media attention. It tried to do it in a surreptitious-I think that is the appropriate word-way, so that the contrast between the increase in salary for staff and the sacrifice made by the work force would not be apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> If productivity is to increase, if industry is to flourish, it needs to be done on a cooperative basis. If one part of the equation that is needed to produce a happy industrial outcome is going to prevaricate and act in a surreptitious fashion, then the unified action that we are looking for will not occur. The way that the management of SPC went about giving the 5 per cent increase to staff was unfortunate. Another illustration of where management or its representatives could have acted in a better way is in the pastoral industry, with the Victorian Farmers Federation and the National Farmers Federation. In Victoria there has been a dispute about the conditions under which shearers work. That has gone before Commissioner Merriman in the Industrial Relations Commission, and some changes have been made by him in respect of which an appeal has been lodged by the Australian Workers Union. At the same time there has been a temptation on the part of the employers to pay below award wages and, unfortunately, in some cases they have given way to that temptation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has often been said to unions that, when they are making decisions that affect their members, they ought to take a ballot-that, for example, there ought to be a ballot as to whether or not to go on strike. Taking this into account, on 3 March this year the union invited the Victorian Farmers Federation and the National Farmers Federation to hold a ballot of their members in the pastoral industry to determine their official position on Commissioner Merriman's decision of 5 February 1991 and their position on the question of the further widening of the shearing combs that shearers use. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a serious proposition from the union, because it believed that the smaller farmers, the ones which had less power within the two federations, disagreed with what the executives of those federations were doing. The following was proposed in a motion that was carried unanimously by the members of the union voting on the measure:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the current practices of the VFF and NFF in determining their positions on major industrial issues is undemocratic and out of step with the majority of farmers and the rural community in general. We believe the NFF and VFF in determining their policies and positions are dictatorial in nature and only act to serve the interests of large Pastoralists in their desire to make financial gain at the expense of rural workers, small farmers and the entire rural community. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, neither the Victorian Farmers Federation nor the National Farmers Federation have conducted a ballot amongst their members. I raise these matters simply to illustrate that in the industrial arena it is time for management, workers and anyone else concerned with that arena to be frank, to be democratic and to act in a way that the other side can respect. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, I want to say something about the common law. It is put by organisations such as the National Farmers Federation and the Victorian Farmers Federation, by many employers and employer bodies, by commentators and by people in the media, that the law should prevail. I agree with that, and that is what I said at the beginning of my speech. Having said that, I think it is proper to recognise some problems with the common law in its ability to deliver equity. There are two ancient concepts running through the English legal system which have much influenced the development of industrial law. The first is that contracts are sacred and the second is that restraint of trade is against the public interest. The influence of those two concepts has often been an unhappy one. The common law gives priority to contractual rights and to the interests of commerce over the needs of working people for fair wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Judges of today are captives of the law as declared by their predecessors. What prompted the courts of yesteryear were the concepts that contracts were inviolate and trade should not be restrained. They were certainly not driven by the concepts that people should receive fair wages and should work in safety and in decent conditions, or that they should work reasonable hours. So when we talk about the need to obey the law-and, as I say, I absolutely agree that we do-it is proper to remember that, given the history of the law and the fact that the law of contracts and the law in respect of restraint of trade evolved long before the industrial law, this developed in a way which often has adverse consequences for workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that it is incumbent upon the legislature to bring about laws that suit the workplace. Indeed, much of the debate in this chamber is directed towards that objective. Another comment I make in this respect is that those ancient concepts of inviolability of contract and of the need for free trade are the same concepts that lie behind sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>

<PARA> Indeed, those concepts are commented upon by the New Zealand bishops. They issued a statement on the employment contracts legislation in New Zealand. The New Zealand law is not as draconian as sections 45d and 45e. I quote the statement of the bishops of New Zealand on this:</PARA>
<PARA>The prescription for freedom in the legislation includes the freedom of the strong to exploit the weak, resulting in less freedom for the weak. Thus the legislation will not lead to common good. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the church teaches that human beings are by nature social beings and therefore the rights of individuals cannot be separated from the duty of individuals and the rights of the group. There is a relational aspect to all human activity: freedom is not the right to do anything one pleases but the right to act freely in doing what is just, not only for oneself but also in relation to others. The pre-eminence given in the legislation to the rights of the individual and the ignoring of the corresponding duties of the individual in effect negate the rights of the group. Thus again the legislation will not lead to the common good. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply say that, in the year 1991, which is the centenary of Rerum Novarum, we should not treat workers as if they were commodities. High Court judges have spoken about that. When I am challenged on 45d and 45e, I say that those sections, certainly in my view, do not conform with the sorts of concepts set out in the bishops' statements or in the encyclical by Pope Leo XIII one hundred years ago or, indeed, in the encyclical, Centesimus Annus, now published by the present Pope. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Alston challenges me in his questions, I say, `Yes, I stand solidly with that hundred years of church teaching and with many other people and great thinkers who say that the oppression of workers in the interests of productivity, in the interests of the economy, is not to be tolerated.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just take up one matter that was raised by Senator Cooney-that is, SPC Ltd. He suggested that it was a stunning example of cooperation between management and union employees. With respect, that is not the truth. The resolution was in spite of current practice, and it was in the teeth of bitter opposition from the Victorian Trades Hall Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Shepparton is a town of some 26,000 people and, as a result of circumstances very much visited upon its business-SPC Ltd-by this Government, those people found themselves facing a very doubtful future. They found that interest rates were going up, their borrowings were going up, their profits were going down and their likelihood of surviving was severely tested. The employees of SPC Ltd entered into an agreement, an 11-point plan, approved by 93 per cent of them in a secret ballot without interference from, approval by or even discussion with the Victorian Trades Hall Council. They were prepared to make certain sacrifices on the basis of keeping their jobs and participating in future profits, but Mr Halfpenny, with his myopic, blinkered, obsessive attitude, said that he would rather see them lose their jobs than compromise previously won conditions. In other words, there would be no room to negotiate backwards for the sake of survival. </PARA>
<PARA> It did not matter to Mr Halfpenny that, in the event of those 300 people losing their jobs, they would lose their homes, they would have no future and there would be no prospects for them in Shepparton. Some rigid, ideological parameter was more important than the practical realities of daily living, so Mr Halfpenny and his cohorts interfered. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only as a result of public outrage and the courage and determination of the Shepparton workers that the Shepparton Preserving Co. and the employees were able to consummate an arrangement, a contractual deal entered into without coercion, but with full agreement between management and employees. With respect, that was with no thanks to the strongarm tactics of the union movement; it was done in spite of those tactics. </PARA>
<PARA> I find myself speaking today on the fifth anniversary of Mr Keating's famous banana republic speech, which occurred on 14 May 1986, if my memory and arithmetic are correct. At that time, Mr Keating said that under certain circumstances this country and our economy would slide into a banana republic. We might well ask ourselves where we are now. The essential question that one is always tempted to ask is: are we better off now than we were when this Government was elected; are we better off now than we were in 1986 when that dire prediction was made by the Treasurer about what would happen to our economy if certain changes did not take place? Let us look at a modest number of the indicators. For instance, have more buildings now been started? Of course, there are fewer now than in 1986. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us look at the level of bankruptcies, which is perhaps some kind of indicator of economic activity. For the March quarter of 1989, there were 1,690 business bankruptcies. In March 1991, there were 2,370. As Senator McMullan will know, statistical bankruptcies are not an indication of the number of people who have gone bankrupt or out of business. A lot of people simply pull down the shingle and walk away. There are those who are surviving with a shingle and nothing else, with simply a shell of a business. They are the sort of indicators that are relevant to making judgments about the performance of this Government. A recent survey was done by the Confederation of Australian Industry on investor confidence. Ninety per cent of the respondents viewed current business conditions as poor, very poor or deeply depressed. Only 10 per cent of the respondents found the circumstances to be other than poor, very poor or deeply depressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the subject of unemployment, which is a human statistic. We see that nationally that figure is running at about 9.9 per cent and in Western Australia at 11 per cent. Those figures do not take into consideration the hidden unemployed or the hidden underemployed, but they account statistically for 884,000 people and 663,000 who are now receiving unemployment benefits-double that of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most stark tragedy of all is youth unemployed. In terms of tomorrow's hope, tomorrow's Australia, the intellectual assets for the future of this country, we find that 27 per cent of people between the ages of 15 and 19 are presently unable to find a job. That is for those who still have the courage and fortitude to keep looking. Of course, what these statistics do not tell us are the number of people who simply opt out and drop out from the pursuit of looking for full time or part time jobs. The tragedy is that in a number of suburbs in Western Australia one in three young people is unemployed. These are the beautiful numbers that Mr Keating talks about. A recent survey showed that 60 per cent more firms plan to cut staff than over the same period last year. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know the social cost of those statistics-the misery, the loss of self-esteem, the despair, the sense of failure. Perhaps what is unique about this recession-cum-depression is that in many respects it is significantly a white collar recession. That does not make it better or worse, but very many people in middle and senior white collar management positions have been made redundant and have no prospect of returning to the work force in comparable positions to those from which they have been retrenched. One of their assets, their unique skills to their employer, is their experience and knowledge about that business. Of course, that is now lost. In fact, taxi companies are reporting an increasing number of people in that category applying for jobs with them. That is not to mention the rural crisis and the tragedy inflicted there. No doubt we shall be told in due course that that is the result of the collapse of commodity prices over which this Government has no control. That does not take into account what this Government can be doing in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say a couple of things about the accord-this discredited deal between the Government and its masters, the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We are told what it has done for Australia. Let us remember that nominal wages have increased by between 6 and 7 per cent since 1983, yet workers during that period have been subject either to flat or to declining levels of real wages. This has given us inflation double that of our Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) trading partners. That is guaranteed to be where it is because the accord puts a floor under inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nominal unit labour costs have increased by 45 per cent between 1984 and 1990 compared with 20 per cent for the OECD countries. In recent times, there has been a modest fall in inflation, but we know that it is not due to increased productivity or a nominal reduction in unit labour costs. It is simply a question of biting into profits. In fact, gross domestic product per hour is below the 1984-85 levels. As I have said, inflation has come down through falling profits and rising unemployed. Thanks to this Government, we now have a standard of living which has declined by 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to touch on one matter that I briefly mentioned last night. This Government has let down itself and Australia in terms of micro-economic reform. It was during the last term of this Government that Mr Keating confessed that the opportunity for micro-economic reform had been lost and that this was to be the new horizon. What we have seen so far has been abysmal. In transport, we have seen no reform whatever. On the waterfront, we have seen Senator Collins valiantly struggling but compromised by the union movement that begrudges every single step backwards that it has taken. It has not been prepared to accept the need for greater productivity other than the price of having extra money put in its own pocket. We see the enormous cost to the Australian taxpayers amounting to an average of $100,000 in redundancy payments to those who are leaving the industry. As I said last night, we are in the same situation as we were. </PARA>

I think Senator Button told us last year that one wharfie had been paid for 20 years and had not been to work for one day. Senator Collins tells us that we can look forward optimistically to significant reforms. The truth is that, even when these reforms take place, they will still leave us way behind the rest of the world. I will say no more other than to observe that when this Government comes up for election it will be ignominiously dumped from office because of its record, if nothing else.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters I wish to speak to this evening. One is to pick up some comments by Senator Crichton-Browne, but I particularly want to refer to an interesting article in the Adelaide Advertiser that appeared on Monday of this week that gives some facts about the reason for bankruptcies and financial breakdowns. In no way do I want to be understood as saying that I am not concerned about the number of people who declare themselves bankrupt; nor do I want to be understood as being unconcerned about the number of people who are suffering hardship. But I am concerned about the misinformation that is being led particularly by the Opposition about these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The gravity of the situation demands that we put facts on the record, particularly facts about bankruptcies. There have been some debates led in this place by the Opposition. I remember Senator Boswell bringing on a debate-either a matter of public importance or an urgency motion-in this place about the appalling number of bankruptcies, but not once in the course of his contribution to that debate did Senator Boswell give a breakdown of bankruptcies. I think it is important for us to consider that, because the serious regard that we should give to this issue is qualified and assisted if we have the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read another article-I cannot find it this evening, so I can do no more than refer to it-which contains a claim that a lot of those in financial difficulties, particularly bankruptcies, were no more than yuppies-I think they call them that-who had dashed into business with no serious consideration of what they were in for, and the easy way out was to declare themselves bankrupt. It allowed them to abdicate their responsibilities towards providing payment for debt and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I want to refer to the evidence contained in an article from the Advertiser of Monday, 13 May 1991. It refers to a very large number of bankruptcies being due to young people who buy `bombs' and do not take out insurance. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Drivers without third party property insurance make up the biggest group of people going bankrupt, the South Australian Financial Counsellors' Association says. </PARA>
<PARA>That would certainly put a qualification on how we address the question of bankruptcies. As I said earlier, I do not want to be understood to be saying that we can therefore dismiss the question of people facing the hardship of bankruptcy but I do think we need to get down and examine the position of those people who are in serious financial difficulty and not those people who are behaving somewhat irresponsibly. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Association president Mr Vin Glenn said young people who choose not to insure their ``bombs'' make up a significant proportion of bankruptcy cases. </PARA>
<PARA> ``They always seem to run into Porsches or other expensive cars and end up with very expensive damage bills,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Glenn said the other two major groups of bankrupts were small business people and redundant workers.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought it would be important for us to tease out those small business people who have seriously tried to run a business and have had difficulty, and take out from the overall figures of bankruptcy those people whom I do not think deserve the same kind of compassion or consideration. For example, I do not believe we should be expressing the same kind of concern for people who are fiscally irresponsible. That is not to say that most people are, but certainly some are. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures taken from the Attorney-General's 1989-90 annual report on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 give the main reasons for business and non-business bankruptcies. Listed under non-business bankruptcies are:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Excessive use of credit.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Liabilities on guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA>3. Unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>4. Gambling.</PARA>
<PARA>5. Ill-health.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Adverse litigation.</PARA>
<PARA>7. Domestic discord. </PARA>
<PARA>I am certainly aware of the difficulty caused to families by No. 7, domestic discord when, particularly at the time of a marriage break-up, the person in business-very often the male-declares himself to be bankrupt so as to avoid some of his financial liabilities as a consequence of that marriage break-up. Under the heading `Business Bankruptcies' were listed:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Lack of capital.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Lack of business ability. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Failure to keep proper books. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Seasonal conditions (floods and droughts). </PARA>
<PARA>6. Excessive interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>7. Inability to collect debts. </PARA>
<PARA>8. Excessive drawings-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning borrowings-</PARA>
<PARA>9. Gambling or speculation. </PARA>
<PARA>10. Personal reasons (ill-health, domestic discord). </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that this report provides information in the debate about bankruptcies. I think the Senate would do itself proud to actually address the facts and breakdown of figures on bankruptcy numbers rather than just use the total number to suggest that everybody who is declared a bankrupt is a victim of the current economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said it once, I have said it twice and I will say it again in case Senator Alston misunderstands me: I have nothing but compassion and concern for people who, for reasons of economic circumstances, lose their business or have to face the difficulty of declaring themselves bankrupt. But I think it is very important that we take out of those aggregate figures those people who are bankrupt for other than those serious reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I put that on the record and refer people to this article by Tim Satchell which appeared in the Advertiser of 13 May this year. It is an analysis of bankruptcies under the operation of the Bankruptcy Act and I think it contains very good information for people who want to address this difficulty seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wanted to raise in the debate on the Appropriation Bills tonight concerns the question of Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA) principally because Senator Kemp has come into this place and it is really quite interesting to listen to Senator Kemp and his comments in some of these debates. He definitely evokes memories of times past. He actually wishes to abuse the union movement, and unionists in general, in a way that is certainly devoid of any current fact. As I said, he indulges in union bashing of a style which is, I think, at least a decade out of date. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it rather disappointing that Senator Kemp would choose to limit himself in that way because, mostly, his contributions under the heading `union bashing' betray a considerable degree of ignorance or misinformation of which he seems not to want to disabuse himself. I think it does him no credit to resort to such primitive and, I think, inaccurate attacks. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the attacks I heard him make in the adjournment debate in the Senate one night concerned APHEDA. I was interested to note that he raised this issue again during the hearings of Estimates Committee B on 1 May. This appears in the Estimates Hansard on pages B135, B136 and B137. Some of the questions asked by Senator Kemp then suggest that he is still not aware of the facts about APHEDA and the funding which goes to the APHEDA organisation. It is disappointing that he continues to attack the union movement in general and in particular by arguing that APHEDA is a disgraceful misappropriation of funds by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to put on the record some facts about APHEDA and remind Senator Kemp that it would do him credit if he got his facts about this matter correct. APHEDA is incorporated, so it is known officially as APHEDA Inc., and it is the overseas aid arm of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> While APHEDA is part of the ACTU, it is legally independent, registered under the Charities Act in New South Wales, and is incorporated as an association under the New South Wales Association Act 1984. It is managed by a board which includes not only ACTU executive members but also community representatives. I suspect that it is under the heading `community representative' that I am a member of that board. </PARA>
<PARA> As an independent, registered organisation, APHEDA not only raises funds from its support base but also submits proposals for funding to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which are assessed on the guidelines as non-government organisations (NGOs). Project funding that is approved is subject to direct agreement between the Government and APHEDA and is not channelled through the ACTU, as Senator Kemp's speeches on this matter have implied. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kemp implies that millions of dollars in taxpayers' money is going to the ACTU for that organisation to keep. In effect, most of the allocations are for specific humanitarian development projects through APHEDA, targeting alleviation of poverty and human resource development in needy communities overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> All of APHEDA's programs which receive financial assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are subject to normal accounting and auditing procedures. Submissions and reports on projects are examined and assessed independently, not by politicians, but by both the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) and, for specific projects, by a group of peers, which is the Committee for Development Co-operation. In addition, APHEDA has its own in-house auditing of its projects and its allocation of money. It is assisted in this process by AIDAB and local embassy personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it disappointing that Senator Kemp has not been interested in finding out the facts about APHEDA but, rather, has come into this place and suggested that AIDAB is actually funding the ACTU. He has, I think, called this a misappropriation of taxpayers' funds, and that is very close to deliberate misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA> APHEDA receives far less in Government assistance than many other non-government organisations which are operating in Australia, and that seems not to be a matter of concern to Senator Kemp. In the financial year 1989-90, World Vision received $7.198m; Care Australia received $5.4m; the Overseas Service Bureau received $4.4m; and all of those organisations were attracting much more government assistance than APHEDA. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth remembering that the amount of money available in the aid program has increased considerably since 1983. For example, to suggest that these funds are politically associated or in any way a misallocation of those funds because of the association of the ACTU with the Australian Labor Party takes no account of the fact that Care Australia, chaired by ex-Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, in 1987-88 received $134,000 from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and by 1989-90 that figure had increased to $5.4m. </PARA>
<PARA> This APHEDA organisation has joined the NGO community in Australia to campaign with all the other aid organisations for greater expenditure by the Australian Government on its overseas aid budget. I think that not only those directly involved with aid associations but also thousands of people in the community are prepared to contribute, through whatever fundraisings there are by all of these NGOs, to assist in overseas aid because of the very extraordinary generosity of the Australian people in contributing to relief works and emergency assistance and directly to overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that distinguishes APHEDA from a number of the other aid organisations is that it has a particular focus-or, if you like, a constitution-that allows it to aim at improving workers' technical skills. It assists the training of workers in developing countries in technical and vocational skills. The benefit of that is that once the Australian assistance and training has been put in place, the Australian aid and participation can cease. The skilled workers are there and able to carry on by themselves because what has been given to them has been that skill, that training. It is distinguished from other aid organisations which are involved more in the direct supply of the bricks and mortar-the food, the relief clothing and so on. It is a very distinct aid organisation and I should have thought that Australians of whatever sort would be very proud that this has been established. </PARA>
<PARA> The APHEDA organisation assists training in 10 countries in the Pacific, South East Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It concentrates its efforts on the poorest countries and, where possible, works with the poorest or most marginalised people-with refugees, young people, women and indigenous or ethnic minorities. The APHEDA organisation is currently funding over 40 projects world wide and some of those are financially or technically supported by individual trade unions. For example, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union has supported job creation and training in the Philippines through the training of blacksmiths; the teachers' union has provided technical training in Tanzania, the Middle East and Cambodia; and the Waterside Workers Federation has provided the training of nurses and midwives in Vietnam. In other words, various unions are prepared almost to adopt a project and they assist directly in keeping an eye on, and providing their fund raising support for, those particular programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The APHEDA agency is a humanitarian aid agency. As I said, it is directed to assisting with the technical training of people overseas. Its mandate from the ACTU does not include trade union training, as Senator Kemp has stated. A number of times he has got his facts wrong. For example, he said that APHEDA was also responsible for funding the Commonwealth trade union centre in Brisbane and the South Pacific trade unions, and this is not the case. The ACTU has its own relationship directly with AIDAB for assistance on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that Senator Kemp betrays a lack of understanding about is development education. In the recent Estimates Committee hearings, he asked questions about the allocation of money for development education and seemed to be rather taken aback that that money was spent in Australia. He asked, `Why doesn't it go overseas?'. Honourable senators in this place, and certainly Senator Kemp, need to know that development education is about educating Australians on the causes and effects of international poverty and its alleviation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the United Nations, we believe that we have an obligation to understand better that world in which we live, particularly the human and environmental conditions that prevail. We also need to appreciate the consequences of international poverty and exploitation. Amongst other issues of concern in this place we are debating economics. It is a matter of considerable gravity that we understand exactly what economic effects happen from prevailing poverty in many countries and in pockets in many countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition in this place sometimes has taken issue with initiatives of this Government, particularly in the area of education. For some strange reason, it seems to be an affront to the Opposition that we should look at things like peace studies. I well remember the outrageous debates led by the Opposition in opposing those initiatives by this Government. We almost had the same kind of fight to get a consideration of Australian history and culture into the curriculum in our schools or tertiary institutions. It seems that the Opposition has the same willingness to not understand what development education is and how appropriately it can be done. It also ought to be understood by Opposition senators, and Senator Kemp in particular, that development education is not something that is done by APHEDA only. Indeed, it is done by most, if not all, of the aid organisations and they all receive assistance to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Development education must be understood to be education of Australians about what underdevelopment means and what development aid can and ought to be about. As I have said before, APHEDA is to be distinguished because of the sort of aid it provides. I hope that Senator Kemp will get his facts about this right and not come into this place with mischievous misinformation. He certainly still seems to suggest that development education money is to be spent overseas, and that is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> He has also referred to wrong figures about the amount of money-or the assistance-for development education provided to APHEDA, claiming in some cases that over $120,000 has gone to APHEDA for this role. In fact, that is not the case. For the financial year 1990-91, APHEDA is receiving $34,000 in assistance for its development education program. Over 20 other non-government organisations also receive allocations under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the issue is very important. It is important to know the facts about APHEDA and what it is doing in overseas assistance. It is also important to know how invaluable non-government organisations' overseas aid has been in allowing the Australian Government to be able to contribute in all sorts of ways in other countries, besides through government to government aid. Some flexibility is provided under non-government organisation aid assistance that is not possible through government to government aid, and I would have thought that that comment would be endorsed by every non-government organisation providing overseas aid from this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also find it curious that the Opposition would want to use APHEDA, and misinformation about APHEDA, as a kind of backdoor way to smash unions. Indeed, if the Opposition were to inform itself properly, it might want to say something about the generosity of unionists in this country, who are not to be distinguished from most other citizens. I would like to know, for example, whether Senator Alston could distinguish a unionist from any other citizen if they were both members of a Rotary club, busy raising money and working in the community. What is the characteristic of a unionist that gets the Opposition so hot under the collar-those unionists who, out of their own funds and out of their own fundraising, have contributed a considerable amount of money through APHEDA to overseas aid, and who have also contributed time?</PARA>
<PARA> We are delighted that Senator Kemp has finally come into the chamber. We are also delighted that, as I understand it, he has already spoken on this debate and will not have the right of reply at least for some hours. I think it is quite surprising that one might want to attack unions for the very generosity that in other forums we claim characterises Australia and Australians. I would have thought that an attack of this sort on the union movement does the Opposition, and Senator Kemp in particular, no credit at all. An attack on APHEDA, and the aid assistance given by this organisation through the generosity and the skills of unionists and through the generosity of the organisation of unionists, does the Opposition no credit at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty I have is that the Opposition seems bent on re-creating arguments that went out of date at least 10 years ago. Union bashing seems to be some kind of dragged up flavour of the month to try to hide the paucity of the Opposition's proposals in addressing any of the issues confronting this country. I have heard questions asked by the Opposition in terms of the costs of labour in this country and suggesting that the union movement is doing nothing to assist recovery and so on. I still find that quite appalling because the union movement, assisted through the accord with the dramatic reduction in real wages-a very reasonable reduction-has contributed so much to restraint and the increased opportunities for people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a matter of looking at just labour costs if one is trying to look at ways in which business or industry in this country can get going; it is also a question of management, a question of investment, a question of venture capital and a question of risk capital-a question of a whole lot of issues. To single out an attack on the union movement is simply to give another measure of Senator Kemp's limitations in his understanding of these issues. I appreciate the opportunity to put those corrections on the record. I look forward to hearing from Senator Kemp in matters of fact on this matter, not fiction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks this evening to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and to refer to some of the educational problems besetting Australia, and particularly rural Australia, at the present time. However, before doing so, let me say that I listened with interest to Senator Crowley trying to explain the high rate of bankruptcies in Australia and how a financial counsellor said that most bankruptcies resulted from young people driving bombs and the drivers of those bombs having accidents by driving into Porsches that other people were driving. It seems to be an extraordinary explanation and I find it very hard to accept. Certainly, Senator Crowley does not seem to realise or accept that the failed policies of this Labor Government are responsible for the high rate of bankruptcies. They contribute in no small way to Australia's present high unemployment rate of 9.9 per cent, which, sadly, is growing all the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, one of the very great problems in this country, one which is perhaps not recognised generally and certainly not by many politicians, is that we have a growing dichotomy between city and country people. We as a nation are growing apart. This is indeed the biggest problem facing this country because we will not survive as a divided nation. The problem across the political field in Australia is that there is very scant regard for rural Australia, and that is because it is a minority. If this problem is not tackled it will destroy this country. There are a number of historical reasons for that dichotomy, although it is true to say that Australia has always been the most urban country in the world, even 100 years ago. But in those days there was a fellow feeling between city and country-a feeling that each depended on the other. That has gone and has largely been replaced by massive ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that in the cities of Australia we find any animosity towards the rural sector or the country in general; it is simply ignorance. The city people do not understand what is happening and do not realise that most of the jobs provided in the cities are actually the product of the wealth that comes from the hinterland of Australia. Today an even greater number of Australians live in urban areas, yet the great bulk of the wealth of this country is generated outside the capital cities. The jobs and the standard of living enjoyed by people are related directly or indirectly to the wealth generated in the hinterland of Australia. At the present time, as I mentioned before, it is rather sad to know that the unemployment figures are so high. Many people are not able to enjoy the standard of living that we would like them to have. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk a lot about being the clever country. I guess it is a noble objective and one we would all like to see achieved, but it is clear to me that there is an inequity in the availability of education. If one lives in Sydney or any of the towns scattered around the eastern seaboard of Australia, if one is the richest person in the world one's child can walk down the street to high school for virtually no charge. In other words, it is almost free education. But if one happens to live in remote Australia-western Queensland, western New South Wales or the remote parts of Western Australia-one cannot do that. In many cases a very high cost is involved in sending children to school. In the name of equity it does not matter how rich we are: we should have the ability to send our children to school at a reasonable comparative cost. But that ability is just not there. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's farming community has the lowest level of formal educational achievement amongst Western industrialised countries. This is obviously a cause for great concern. Statistics compiled by the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture show that less than a quarter of the Australian farm work force possesses more than a lower secondary education. This contrasts with more than 50 per cent in New Zealand, North America and western Europe and upwards of 90 per cent in Scandinavian countries. </PARA>
<PARA> This worries me enormously. Australian rural communities, and farmers in particular, have had an excellent record for productivity improvement in Australia in the past. They have far outstripped all other sectors of the economy, but one of the things that will increasingly hold them back in the future is a lack of preparation at an educational level to enable them to meet the challenges and grasp the opportunities of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Studies in Australia and the United States of America have shown that higher levels of education and training significantly improve farm productivity. That is important, not only for the farmers involved in these tight times but also for Australia, which is desperately in need of export improvement and enhancement. There is also a problem with our need to keep young people on the land. That problem is directly related to being able to better equip them to cope with the challenges that confront them. This problem also arises from the few educational opportunities available. Only last Saturday honourable senators would have read in the Australian newspaper an article reporting the comments of Mr Dave Thomas, a farmer from western Victoria. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> ``What galls me most is the thought that our best product, our children-we're exporting them. We need their ability, their youth and strength and talents and skills to build a viable agriculture in the future, and they are leaving. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In some districts you can count the number of young people under 25 on one hand,'' he says. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Where will Australia find its farming expertise in the future?''</PARA>
<PARA>With economic conditions such as we are now facing in many cases, it is the education of rural children which is suffering. Many on the Government side are ideologically opposed to private boarding schools, but for students in isolated areas it is their only access to high school education. This fact is recognised by this Labor Government through the payment of an isolated children's allowance. For each child who is forced to leave home and study because of isolation, a non-means-tested, non-asset-tested allowance of $1,500 is paid. Any additional payment is income and asset tested. The maximum allowance per year for primary school students is $2,912; for high school students under 16 years of age, $3,235; and for those over 16, slightly more. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the cost of tuition and board at an average boarding school is in the vicinity of $11,500 per year. One does not have to be a mathematical genius to calculate that parents have to pay a shortfall of approximately $8,000 per student per year. Even in the case of city parents who send their child to a school like that, a good quality school, it still means that a lot of money has to be paid out for that child's education. These costs are horrendous, especially when parents have two, three, or four children away at school. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I had the opportunity to talk to some members of the Isolated Childrens Parents Association (ICPA) about the crisis being faced by farming families who are trying to educate their children. I congratulate the ICPA on the work it is doing to improve access to education for students in isolated areas of Australia. When the assistance for isolated children (AIC) scheme was introduced in 1973 by Mr Kim Beazley, Sr, the then Labor Minister for Education, the basic payment represented 55 per cent of average Australian boarding costs. In 1991, it represents only 32 per cent. If we were to increase the allowance to that original benchmark of 55 per cent, it would amount to $2,650 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> This allowance is not just for a tiny group of students. The ICPA is pleading for the continued education of 9,000 geographically isolated children throughout Australia. Surely it is not asking too much of the Government to give some extra help. Australia's 9,000-plus geographically isolated students are the only ones in the country who do not have the option of a free or low cost bus to a free government school if they suffer a financial disaster. School is too far away and isolated parents have always had to pay in thousands, not hundreds, of dollars in order to get to the school gate. </PARA>
<PARA> When uninsurable flood, fire, drought or price collapses strike, such as in the last 12 months, remote families must still find the cash or credit to get their children to school; otherwise they have to drive excessive distances to school or teach their children by correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA> Government assistance for isolated children eases the financial burden in normal times, but it is proving very inadequate in the rural depression sweeping Australia. I have a few examples from the ICPA of what this depression is doing to rural families. The first family that is mentioned lives on a specialist sheep and wool property in the western division of New South Wales. Like many areas of remote Australia, it has land tenure laws restricting the sale of land. The property also supports two grandparents who are assets tested out of the age pension. Three children were attending school 120 kilometres away via the local school hostel. The annual fees are $4,560 by three, which equals $13,680. Federal assistance for isolated children of $1500 by three equals $4,500, which reduces the cash cost to $9,000. This amount plus family living expenses has to be borrowed from the agents at 18 per cent interest. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of term one in 1991, one student has been withdrawn from the local school and hostel. The mother is attempting to teach correspondence and run the farm, whilst the father is travelling 1,200 kilometres to cotton country to try to earn sufficient money to pay the two remaining hostel fees and to support the household. The mother has indicated to the hostel that the other two hostel boarders will probably be withdrawn before the end of 1991 as the father is unlikely to find continuous outside work for the whole of the rest of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second example, the family live on a specialist sheep and wool property in the western division of New South Wales, 160 kilometres from their nearest school. They have had four students attending school via the local hostel. One student now remains at the hostel; one is being taught by correspondence at home; and two boys left school in years 9 and 10 to go shearing to generate some outside income for family support. That is rather a hard job for children who have been in grades 9 and 10 at school. The family have negligible net income and are precluded from additional AIC allowance by the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> The third example is of a family whose eldest child boards with the grandmother in order to attend high school. This family also lives on a specialist sheep and wool property in the New South Wales western division. Two children are at home being taught by their mother through correspondence. In 1990, before the wool and sheep price crash, the property was above the assets test limit. At the end of 1990, the property was auctioned and failed to attract one bid. Then and now the family are precluded from additional AIC allowance because of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> After having cut their spending to the bone, parents are currently having to withdraw their children from boarding school. For those in extreme financial difficulties, this means bringing their children home and assisting them with their schooling by means of correspondence. However, in the main, this situation is far from satisfactory because, apart from the social aspects, the children must rely heavily on their parents' time and educational skills. </PARA>
<PARA> This is placing great stress on many families. Not being able to afford any labour means that the wife must spend a greater time helping her husband outside, whilst at the same time her children need her assistance with their correspondence lessons. This could also be said of the husbands where the role is reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> Other parents are driving their children excessive distances morning and afternoon, either to and from school or to catch a school bus. Apart from the physical toll on the child, any person who has driven in the outback would be extremely concerned if someone had to be on the road every day because of the appalling conditions under which they would often have to drive. </PARA>
<PARA> To avoid this situation, some mothers are leaving their husbands and renting a house in the nearest major centre which has a high school so that they can care for their children during the week. They return home only at weekends and this often involves a 250- to 350-kilometre drive one way on dirt roads with the added danger of hitting a kangaroo, an emu, or a goat, for example. That is certainly not conducive to keeping families together. </PARA>
<PARA> Other families will have to place their children in a student hostel in their nearest major centre with a high school. However, these hostels have only limited vacancies and cost approximately $4,500 per student per year, so some parents will find themselves in a very difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not uncommon when travelling in remote Australia to be told by parents and relatives of schoolchildren that because they can no longer afford to pay hostel boarding costs they have to withdraw their children from high school in the nearest provincial centre. Many of these parents are not farmers but townsfolk on wages, and they cannot afford to pay the difference between the isolated children's allowance and the fee charged by the hostels. This is not the fault of the hostels, because they also are victims of the Government's high income cost policy. It is a particularly sad reflection on Australia when the education of rural students is at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Testimony to the imbalance which now exists between rural and urban students is the fact that at the post-graduate level there is a higher proportion of students from urban areas than from rural and remote regions. The enrolment figures show that 16 per cent of enrolments came from urban Australia, while 12 per cent came from rural Australia. This only serves to highlight the need to provide incentive and genuine assistance for students living away from accessible education resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures show that 75 per cent of Australia's higher education students come from urban backgrounds; 19 per cent from rural areas; and only 3 per cent from the largest geographic areas-the remote areas of Australia. This situation reflects the incapacity of remote families to cope with the financial burdens associated with higher education, and I regret to say it is set to worsen. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remember that an essential feature of a fair society is equality of educational opportunities. It is therefore the role of government to ensure that financial barriers are removed in education so that all Australians have the opportunity to participate in the wide and improved range of employment, education and training opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was never my intention that that notice of motion be just one of those given as virtually a brief speech, with no follow-up. I had thought it might have been brought on for debate. However, there was no sign of that happening, so yesterday I withdrew it in favour of the alternative of speaking in this debate on the Appropriation Bills. My withdrawing it has ensured that there can be no argument about my right to speak about the issues which would have been raised in that motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I welcome the opportunity to explain my case on this matter. All I ask is for those opposite to listen carefully to what I say, not what they think I might have said. Some of those who criticised me for the notice of motion have completely misunderstood my position. So, first, I should answer the question: why did I do this when-it is claimed-nobody had complained before? My action has been described as unprecedented. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been plenty of complaints before-for years that I know of-but nobody has openly complained before, because they have judged that it was not worth the trouble. I have judged that, even though it would bring trouble, it was something that had to be done. Many have complained for years, but I decided it was about time the complaints were brought to the surface. Continuing to keep silent, gritting one's teeth and bearing it, implied only approval or at least acquiescence. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that what I have raised is a very serious matter. I am not one for going overboard about something, even when I am very angry or resentful; I tend to seethe about things quietly. I am certainly not a person who enjoys or seeks out conflict. But it is too serious a matter for me to continue biting my tongue. Many of us feel we have put up with the situation for long enough. My tolerance certainly finally ran out, and I gave that notice of motion. Let me put a few things straight on the record, as apparently they need to be said, judging by some of the points made in defence of the Clerks following my notice. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said nothing about whether the Clerks are good fellows, cheerful, hard workers, helpful, wonderful and wise. These sorts of things are not at issue. I have nothing personally against the Clerks. I have been full of praise for much of their work, such as the redrafting and modernising of the Standing Orders in the last couple of years. The Clerk is able to produce-in no time flat-learned commentaries on all sorts of issues which arise. I do not decry his knowledge and understanding; his capacity for producing documentation is well known; he is assiduous at that task and has a prodigious output. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I emphasise that I do not complain about the Clerks providing procedural advice to all sides in the Senate. There have been occasions when I have sought advice myself. That is an important part of their job, and they must be allowed to do it. Nowhere have I said that they should not do that, or that they do not do it well. I repeat that I am not complaining about the provision of advice. I do not suggest that advice which happens to be contrary to one party's objectives is partisan. </PARA>
<PARA> May I also put on the record why I did not discuss my complaints with the Clerk before giving my notice of motion. I did not do so because I believed it was quite inappropriate for me to enter into political debate with the Clerk or other officers of the Senate. It is precisely this issue of independence which was at the very root of my motion. I still believe that to be a correct stance. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the Clerk disagrees with my characterisation of such discussion as political. My definition of what is political is obviously much broader than his. It is not a question of party political at all, but political in the wide sense. I think it would be an impossible situation to argue these issues with those who I believe should be avoiding them. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there was a problem in having a notice of motion sitting undebated on the Notice Paper for a long period. But that is precisely what happens to most such notices, including some quite abusive of other people unable to defend themselves. It does not come well from those who use, and support the use of, this procedure day in day out to now decry it. Clearly, the Clerks are not short of supporters on the other side to speak for them and defend them. That raises a significant point: does it not make the Clerk, and the Opposition for that matter, stop and think, when all the support and defence comes from one side of the chamber?</PARA>
<PARA> I shall briefly state my general concern before dealing with the specific issues which I had set out in the motion. My concern is with the clerkist hierarchy of this place running its own political agenda. Again, I emphasise I use political in the broad sense. I emphasise I am not talking about their legitimate role of providing procedural advice when requested. I am talking about assuming a licence to go much further and to step over the mark between correct behaviour on the one hand and too great an involvement in the political process on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a partisanship, not on a party political basis per se, though because of the nature of things it effectively becomes so. Partisan, by the way, is given the following alternatives in the thesaurus: biased, myopic, narrow, partial, prejudiced. Most of those alternatives could be satisfactorily substituted for partisan if that word is thought to be too strong. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a partisanship against anyone who does not automatically accept the suggestion that the Senate is an institution always to be revered in a way defined by the Clerks of whom I speak. The present Clerk is not the only one worthy of this complaint. The Clerk, in his letter which Senator Hill incorporated in Hansard on 19 February, quotes `far more robust' comments from his predecessors, which did not lead to adverse comment. That may well be true, but I would suggest that past tolerance does not prove that there is a licence. It merely provides an interesting comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the present clerkist hierarchy, I only included in the notice of motion the two which I had specified, but there is a more general Senate culture which they encourage and those who do not subscribe to it do not get on in this little Senate world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few minutes of the time of the Senate tonight to speak in memoriam of a very special friend and a very special man. I suppose that it is not usual to do this in this place. From time to time we do acknowledge people who have contributed to public office in a special way, but I think it is probably not usual for individual senators to do this on behalf of what we might call their average citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to speak tonight about a doctor, friend and colleague in South Australia, Deane Southgate, who died very suddenly two weeks ago. I also wish to acknowledge a respect for the preferment of members of his family for discretion about how he is mentioned after his death. They do not wish to make too much of this man's talents and his contribution not only to South Australia but to Australia. I believe that I do not abuse that preferment of the family if I place on record a few comments about Deane Southgate. </PARA>
<PARA> He was an associate professor of community medicine at Flinders Medical Centre in South Australia. He was a practising general practitioner, maintaining a half time involvement in general practice because of his passionate commitment to it and his understanding that he would be better able to speak about it and represent it if he continued in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Deane Southgate was also one of the driving forces behind the establishment of community health centres in general in South Australia and, in particular, Clovelly Park Community Health Centre, where I worked for some 10 years before coming into this place. He was very involved with the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a bridge builder not only in his medical and political life but in all areas of his life. If people were at odds with each other, he was at pains to try to find a way to bridge the gap between them. Deane Southgate was a founding force in the establishment of the Service to Youth Council Incorporated in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In all sorts of ways and in any number of areas in community life in South Australia, this man left his mark. His mark was of compassion and concern and of rigour and integrity. Deane Southgate was never a sloppy thinker. But in the way in which he practised his medicine and his life and his medical and political involvement, he was always concerned to have a regard for the condition of ordinary people and for those people who may find themselves behind the eight ball. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, he was very concerned to ensure that people in the community did not just talk about the problems of our youth but tried to set up a structure to address them. Indeed, the Service to Youth Council in South Australia has an excellent reputation partly because of the care, regard and compassion of those people who established that organisation and the way that the original founding intentions have been carried on by all those people continuing its work. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is some measure of a person's standing in the community to mention the number of people at the funeral. I did not do a head count, but a very large number of people took time from their busy lives to pay their last respects to this very special man. </PARA>
<PARA> Deane Southgate was a most unusual man and I believe that he was a very great man. Indeed, I suppose it is all the more remarkable because not only did he not sing his own praises, but also he was at pains to get other people not to sing his praises. It was interesting for a number of us who knew him well and knew how he preferred not to seek that recognition to learn that, in the last honours, he was awarded the Order of Australia, which he was to receive the Tuesday after his death, which was on a Saturday. That honour will be provided to members of his family in a private ceremony at some time when they are in a better frame of mind to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that Deane Southgate's contribution to the community did receive public recognition through the Australia Day awards and I am delighted that the work he set in train will continue. It was another way in which Deane Southgate can be characterised. It was important to set up the institutions, to set up the structures, and to make sure that the right people were appointed to continue that work. It was not necessary for him to continue or to promote his own glory. </PARA>
<PARA> Deane Southgate was a very special man. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to place on record those comments by way of acknowledging his contribution to South Australia and to Australia. In particular, I place on record his contribution to part of my development and to some of the benefits that I have obtained from knowing him. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not given anything like a definitive list of his achievements, the medical organisations he was involved in or the many people whose lives he touched. I am simply placing on record the benefits that I received from knowing this person. I say a thank you for having the opportunity to have crossed the path of such a man and to thank his family because they are of the same order and ilk. It has been very special knowing him and continuing to know his family. </PARA>

This same senator-Senator Coates-is a man who had himself added to Senate Estimates Committee A, together with one Senator Schacht.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.43 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to speak about the Anzac frigate project and the Newcastle connection. Ten days ago it was announced that $167m worth of the Anzac frigate work would be offered to New Zealand companies over the next three to nine months. This was in addition to $30m worth of project work already signed up, making a total of $200m which has so far gone to New Zealand. With the promise of another $350m, that makes over half a billion dollars guaranteed to New Zealand. On top of that, Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd (AMECON) is also reported as encouraging New Zealand companies to win some of the work earmarked for Australia because the price structure is lower in New Zealand than it is in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By comparison, of the $700m worth of work promised by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and AMECON to go to Newcastle, only $4m worth has been let in Newcastle so far. Where is the remaining $696m? The honourable member for Shortland, Mr Peter Morris, says that it will come one day. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tenders have not yet been called. </PARA>
<PARA> They are yet to be called. </PARA>
<PARA> In time, those tenders will be called and the opportunity will be there for Hunter firms to tender for the work that is likely to come up. </PARA>
<PARA>I have news for the honourable member for Shortland-time is running out for Newcastle and so is the money. The honourable member for Newcastle, Mr Allan Morris, might well claim on television that there will definitely be contracts for the Hunter, but where are they? Of the project that is now worth over $4 billion, $2 billion has already been let out, but only $4m of that has gone to Newcastle-only $4m. What has gone wrong? Where are the contracts and where has the money gone that should have come to the Hunter?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the Senate the sorry tale of how the Hunter has been sold down the river yet again by the Federal Labor Government. On 20 January 1987, the Australian Government announced that it was seeking a new surface combatant to be built in Australia to an overseas design, at an estimated cost of $3.5 billion. It was to be known as the joint Australian/New Zealand project, and became known as the Anzac frigate contract. It is the largest defence contract ever awarded in Australia. Eighty per cent of the outlay on the program was expected to be spent in Australia and New Zealand, and it was estimated that it would create at least 12,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian companies were invited to tender for the role of the prime contractor for this frigate project. Two designs were chosen: the Meko design of West Germany and a version of the M class frigate of Holland. At the outset, 13 organisations indicated an interest in the project. On Christmas Eve 1987 came the announcement of the two preferred organisations or consortia. They were Victorian-based AMECON, offering the Meko design of West Germany, and New South Wales-based Australian Warships Systems (AWS), a consortium comprising Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, AWA, Carringtons and New Zealand McConnell Dowell, which was offering the Dutch design M class frigate to be built principally at Newcastle but with subcontracting elsewhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWS consortium was viewed as being Newcastle-based chiefly because of the involvement of Carrington Slipways, which was the only current shipbuilder in the group, and it had already had experience in building Navy contracts through the minehunter project. These two consortia were now invited to tender as prime contractors for the detailed design and production of the Anzac ships. Australian Warships Systems publicly indicated that it would build the ships at Carringtons' facilities on the Hunter River and float the vessels downstream to be fitted out at the Government dockyard. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of 1988, the New Zealand Government was getting cold feet over the whole project. The Australian Government offered to allow New Zealand industry to bid for local content in Australia's general defence procurement program to maintain New Zealand interest in Anzac defence projects, including the frigates. However, Australia was prepared to go it alone in building the frigates if the New Zealand Government would bow to internal pressure and pull out of the project. I want to stress New Zealand's reluctance towards involvement in the project in 1988, in the light of the very generous contracts which have been awarded to New Zealand in the last two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The final choice for the contract was to be decided between AMECON and AWS, that is, between Victoria and New South Wales. To indicate the importance of the contract for the winning contender, I remind the Senate that the handling of this contract would give the winning bidder a solid base for future industrial development. More than half the value of the construction would be made up of electronic and sophisticated technological equipment. Although AMECON would naturally situate the carriage of its construction at Williamstown and Australian Warships Systems at Carrington Slipways in Newcastle, both tenderers stressed that they would farm out substantial proportions of the project interstate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on 14 August 1989, the Government announced that AMECON had been chosen to build the frigates. The new ships were to be built at Williamstown dockyard in Victoria and in Newcastle, at a total project cost of $3 1/2 billion for eight ships. The project would last for more than a decade. It would create over 7,000 jobs directly and 5,000 indirectly. However, at that time it was stressed that the benefits were to be spread around Australia, and that it was to be a truly national project. At that stage, Newcastle was still to have a share in the project, according to the Government. The Government's announcement was absolutely unequivocal. These are former Defence Minister Beazley's actual words:</PARA>
<PARA>Newcastle will play a particularly important role in the Anzac frigate project. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the AMECON offer Newcastle will build 58 hull sections. </PARA>
<PARA>Five of the twelve ships will be assembled and launched in Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA>This and other work on the ships will give Newcastle industry $700 million of direct work, and create 1,200 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>This project will bring to Newcastle a full range of shipbuilding skills, including not only the traditional steel-fabrication work, but also engineering, electrical, electronic, pipework, mechanical assembly, outfitting, commissioning and testing. </PARA>
<PARA>This will strengthen Newcastle's capabilities and provide opportunities to play a major role in through-life support for the Anzac ships and other navy vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was equally explicit on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Newcastle on 18 August 1989. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that Newcastle is going to have $700 million invested. There's a minimum of $700 million to be invested in Newcastle with 1200 jobs to be created there. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the biggest contracts that will have ever come into Newcastle-$700 million worth of investments and 1200 jobs at least. </PARA>
<PARA>I give a guarantee that I will ensure that every possible piece of work that can go to Newcastle consistent with meeting the Cross criteria, every piece of work that can go to Newcastle will go there. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government stated at the time that AMECON had been chosen to build the Anzac frigates because the consortium offered a comparable product at a lower price than its competitor, Australian Warships Systems (AWS). The AMECON bid was some $350m less than the AWS bid. The Government then finalised a contract with AMECON to build 10 ships with options to vary the number to either eight or 12. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989 New Zealand was still to choose whether it would participate in the project. If New Zealand decided not to participate in the project, work on the Australian ships which would have gone to New Zealand firms then would be done in Australia. The Government promised that Newcastle would be the major beneficiary as AMECON would be building at least another extra 15 ship sections there. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: the Government stated very clearly that all States would benefit, especially New South Wales and Victoria. New South Wales and Victoria would each receive 40 per cent of the frigate work in Australia; South Australia was to receive 16 per cent; and the balance was to be shared amongst the other States. Carrington Slipways in Newcastle, as part of AWS, missed out on being chosen as the prime contractor, but the Government indicated that Carrington Slipways would gain work from the AMECON group. That is what was promised on 14 August 1989. What has happened since that date?</PARA>
<PARA> In December it was fairly certain that contractual work would come to Newcastle, but perhaps not before 1991. The Managing Director of AMECON claimed that it was AMECON's firm intention `to do half of the project's shipbuilding in Newcastle and the other half at its Williamstown shipyard'. He stated that Newcastle companies would have to win work through competitive tendering. He had no doubt that the region would get its promised $700m worth of work, but he refused to give guarantees. Already the Government's promise of work for Newcastle was being watered down. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of 1989, the promises for Newcastle and the frigates amounted to the following: an AMECON promise for five of the 12 frigate hulls to be built in Newcastle; a promise from Prime Minister Hawke for $700m to be invested in Newcastle and the creation of 1,200 jobs; and a promise from Defence Minister Beazley, as he then was, that a Federal Cabinet committee would ensure that Newcastle was awarded a fair share of electronic and engineering work. To date, only one contract has come to Newcastle-a $4m contract to Commonwealth Steel to provide part of the propulsion system for the Anzac frigates. We are still waiting to hear when Newcastle will get the remaining $696m that was promised to it less than two years ago by the Prime Minister and Defence Minister Beazley. </PARA>
<PARA> Then came the news of the contracts to New Zealand, a country which has been reluctant all along to join the program and which now benefits greatly from it. Once again, Hunter and Newcastle have been jilted by this Federal Labor Government. Once again, Newcastle has missed the boat at a time when our own manufacturing sector is in a perilous state. Almost every remaining dollar's worth of work on the Anzac frigates would have to go to Newcastle for the promises of the Prime Minister, the Defence Minister and AMECON to be honoured. This will not happen. The Federal Labor Government should hang its head in shame and apologise to the people of Newcastle for its mismanagement, its broken promises and its wilful destruction of a very fine shipbuilding industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief, but I wish to draw the Senate's attention to a matter that happened over the weekend. On Sunday 12 May Tasmania, and indeed Australia, lost an individual who carved for himself a remarkable niche in the history of our nation. I refer to Tasmania's world-renowned naturalist, artist and retired tin miner, Mr Deny King, of Melaleuca, near Port Davey, who at 81 years of age passed away after suffering a heart attack in Hobart on Sunday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those who are wondering where Melaleuca is, it is situated in Port Davey in south-west Tasmania, part of the South West National Park. It is about 120 kilometres south of Hobart. One cannot go much further than that. It is unbearably hot in summer, but mostly it is a chillingly cold and wet place. </PARA>
<PARA> Deny King was not a man who could be considered famous in the conventional sense. To some his achievements may seem small in the global sense of things, but Deny King was special because he achieved the rare distinction of becoming a legend in his own lifetime. The list of those who have expressed their respect for his outstanding contribution includes those who have taken the immense trouble to visit him personally at Melaleuca. I refer to individuals such as explorer Sir Edmund Hilary, photographer Lord Snowdon, and our present GovernorGeneral, Bill Hayden. </PARA>
<PARA> Deny King symbolised the attributes of our forefathers, which have made Australia such an outstanding nation. He battled the elements and won. He knew loneliness and failure and he survived. He overcame adversity to build a home in the wilderness and to raise a family, while at the same time providing hospitality for anybody who called upon him. I did not know Deny King personally but, like thousands of others, I have been touched by this man, his modesty and the contribution he made towards ensuring that the unique nature of Tasmania's southern natural heritage was brought to the world's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Although a tin miner, Deny King was a conservationist long before it was fashionable. He was a naturalist with a concern for our native flora and fauna while many species were being eradicated from our continent. Deny King sought to open up the wilderness to those who valued it as much as he did, and in return he shared his own knowledge, much of which had been gained through his own experiences with those who were interested. He was born in 1906 on a farm outside Judbury in the Huon Valley and later joined his father, Charles, at a tin mining operation which he had established in the early 1930s at Cox Bight near Port Davey. Eventually he moved to Melaleuca just after the World War to work his own tin mine. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who are familiar with the ruggedness of Tasmania's southern coast would have some idea of the adversity which Deny King and his wife, Margaret, experienced in establishing their home. Everything had to be shipped into the area by boat as the area was, and remains, virtually isolated from the outside world. Visitors largely consisted of fishing boat crews and those members of pleasure boats who were game enough to make the journey south. </PARA>
<PARA> Such was the scale of Deny King's independence that he eventually built his own airstrip near his home and built his own windmill to generate his power. In recognition of the contribution which Deny King made to this southern wilderness area, last year the State Government gave him a 20-year crown lease on his existing property so that he could continue to live in the area which had become his home, even though it is within the world heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Senate, I wish to extend our deepest sympathy to his surviving family-daughters, Mary and Janet, son-in-law, Geoff Fenton, and his grandchildren. I know that many throughout the world will feel a distinct sense of loss at his passing. Deny King will never be replaced, and neither can the unique area of Tasmania's south which he sought to protect. Deny King should be remembered as an individual who led us to a greater understanding of Tasmania's special heritage. </PARA>

<PARA>SENATOR BADEN TEAGUE</PARA>
<PARA>OPPOSITION URGES AUSTUDY HELP FOR RURAL STUDENTS</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate has passed a resolution moved by Senator Baden Teague (Liberal, South Australia) on behalf of the Opposition urging the Federal Government to give immediate help to students who are being denied Austudy although their families have been hit by the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague explained that his objectives with the motion were:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To persuade the Government to act immediately to introduce emergency educational assistance by means of hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. To ensure the special extension of Austudy benefits will be specifically targeted to rural families in financial difficulties as a result of the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. To gain changes favourable to rural families in the Government's administration of the Austudy program especially by lowering of the Australian Valuation Office's estimates of rural property values thus removing the present cause of prevalent appeals. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, the Senate rejected attempts by the Australian Democrats to disallow a number of Austudy regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague said that the Opposition opposed the disallowance because it would have crippled the entire Austudy scheme, with no payments being possible from 13 May. </PARA>
<PARA>``The motion to disallow the entire assets test was not targeted to benefit those suffering from the rural crisis. Most of those who would benefit from complete abolition of the assets test are outside rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>``The cost to the budget would be substantial. The cost of ending the assets test would be $57 million. The cost of disallowing other regulations so that eligibility became almost universal would be $1200 million. </PARA>
<PARA>``The Opposition insists that the right course is one that targets those in most financial need for special help.''</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague told the Senate: ``I want to say to the bush, to rural families in the country, that we understand the burden they are feeling and we are responding directly. We know the burden that is being felt in the Mallee, in the Eyre Peninsula, in the west out to Meekatharra, in Tasmania and in Queensland. We know there is an enormous struggle. I am deeply moved when I hear medical practitioners say that all their patients showing up in the middle of the Mallee have distress symptoms. On behalf of the Opposition, I want to assure those living in country areas that we have heard the cry. We will continue to be with them; we want to share the burden with them; and we want to ensure that they know that the representatives elected from rural areas are bringing those cries of anguish to our deliberations here in the Parliament.''</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague on behalf of the Opposition reemphasised the Liberal-National Party policy to abolish the assets test on the Isolated Children's Assistance Scheme and to maintain its opposition to any assets test on Family Allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>The resolution passed by the Senate on 13 May stated:</PARA>
<PARA>``That the Senate calls on the Government to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from Austudy by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds.''</PARA>

I also eventually will seek leave to incorporate a press release issued by Senator Lees consisting of two pages which, it appears, she issued late last night following yesterday's debate. I point out to the Senate that there are 21 errors, 21 false assertions, in Senator Lees's press release. I want to enumerate them and I shall spend no more than five minutes on that task. Rather than wasting the time of the Senate, I shall briefly enumerate the errors. Because I shall eventually incorporate the full statement, any member of this Parliament, or indeed any members of the public, can examine the statement for themselves to find out what blatant dishonesty, what blatant misleading of the public is involved in the Australian Democrats' press release. Because I want the same standard to be applied to myself, I have already incorporated my own press release, and I do not mind if anyone wishes to bring to my attention anything that he or she thinks is of doubtful assertion. I believe that my press release is sound. I issued it before I saw the Democrat press release. My document is not in any way written to contrast with the Democrat release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrat press release is an appalling document to the public from those who claim that they want to keep the rest of us honest. It comes from the Democrats, who claim they want honesty in advertising. What hypocrisy! What lack of integrity! I am dumbfounded by the kind of assertions that are made by Senator Lees. I warned Senator Lees a couple of hours ago, at 9 p.m., that I intended to speak on the adjournment tonight, and she has every opportunity to speak this evening if she wishes to do so, following my remarks. I refer to the first error. In the first paragraph she claims:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National parties today rejected a move in the Senate by the Australian Democrats to make Austudy immediately available . . .</PARA>
<PARA>For a start, the Opposition-and I was the Senator responsible for putting the Opposition case in the debate yesterday-was successful in seeing passed by the Senate the only resolution that came out of that debate. That was a positive resolution seeking to extend the availability immediately of Austudy to the target group-that is, families involved in the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a second error in the statement that infers that the Democrats would have made this immediately available. In fact, the reverse is the case. Senator Bell's motion, as everyone asserted in the debate, would have immediately stopped all Austudy payments to all students in Australia because regulation 61 would have been disallowed and not operable. That is the regulation that sets out the level of all allowances. The second error also refers to the Democrats' attempt as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to have genuine farm and small business assets exempted from inclusion in the assets test . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is patently false. There was no reference in any of the motions that were moved by the Democrats to `genuine farm and small business assets'. The Democrats' disallowance motion was to remove completely the assets test and did not refer to genuine farm and small business assets. The third error, which occurs in the third paragraph, is this:</PARA>
<PARA>The rejection means that students from the majority of farming and country small business families will continue to be excluded . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is false. A majority were in any event excluded, and even with whatever changes were contemplated in yesterday's debate I believe that they would continue to be excluded. As we well know, only 40 per cent of students receive Austudy. That applies to city and country alike. The fourth factual error lies in the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA>Both parties have voted to continue the current discriminatory system, which excludes some students from education allowances simply because of their parents' occupation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is no such reference to parents' occupation in the Austudy regulations or in any aspect of the regulations that were being debated yesterday in the Senate. It is not a scheme that is in any way related to occupation, and it is false to assert that. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth error is that students also will be excluded `regardless of their parents' income'. That is false. Everybody knows that the Austudy test is based upon an income test and an asset test. The income test is the most operable part of the basis for qualifying for Austudy. So the reference to `regardless of their parents' income' is factually incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth error is in the passage referring to the Democrats acting to rectify the fault identified by Dr Kemp. Dr Kemp identified a fault whereby the assets test was denying rural families access to Austudy. The remedy that was put forward by the Democrats was not to rectify that fault but, in fact, to abolish the whole assets test. The Democrats' action went much broader than addressing the fault that was identified by Dr Kemp. The seventh error claims that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Liberals were paranoid about getting another bucketing by Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA>That is false and is just abuse. Let me say honestly in the Senate-and Senator Newman would attest to this-that I did not even think of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in any of the five hours of debate yesterday. I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, who is smilingly acknowledging my point, that I did not even think of the Treasurer. Let alone my being paranoid, I was excited that the Opposition's initiative was to be supported by the Senate, and it was at 10.25 last night. </PARA>
<PARA> The eighth point claims that the Liberals are `paralysed by inaction'. That is patently false in that we actively moved a motion last night that was adopted by the Senate. We are not paralysed; we are not inactive. The ninth error relates to the passage that reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberals first tried to suggest that it was not possible to disallow specific Austudy regulations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Not one senator asserted that in the debate yesterday. What I clearly asserted -and it is in the Hansard record for yesterday-is that one cannot amend regulations. But I made it quite clear that it was a black or white choice. We could allow the regulations to stand or we could disallow any specific regulation or set of regulations. It is patently false for the Democrat Senator Lees to make such a statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The tenth error relates to our statement that the whole scheme would collapse if the Liberals supported the Democrats. She said that this was total nonsense. It is not total nonsense to say that the scheme would collapse. Not only did the Opposition-every one of us who spoke-assert that, but so also did the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus. He said that we would not have an Austudy scheme; the whole scheme would collapse if regulation 61 were to be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA> The eleventh error-which is not only factually wrong but also is most unjust in that, God forbid, Senator Lees brings the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, directly into this debate-is in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this . . . total nonsense was pointed out to them by the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, and they started looking for another excuse. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Senator representing the Opposition's case throughout the whole of yesterday, I state very clearly here and now that not once did I speak to Mr Evans; ask advice of Mr Evans; nor ask for anything in writing or by telephone. Nor did any of my colleagues refer anything at all to me that was purported to be a communication or advice which could be attributed to the Clerk of the Senate. I believe it is entirely wrong to polarise a difficulty in debate that the Democrats have by drawing in good officers of this Senate. I really believe that not only should Senator Lees apologise for these 21 errors which I am in the middle of listing but also this assertion in particular should be retracted and a direct apology given to the Clerk of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The twelfth error is that Senator Lees says we in the Opposition `called for yet another review'. I ask anyone to look at the record of yesterday. Not one Opposition senator called for a review. In fact, we said that we had had a review-a review has been conducted by the House of Representatives. We called for immediate action by the Government to implement hardship provisions and improvements in the administration of the Austudy scheme in order to give immediate relief and immediate access to rural families who are suffering in the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The thirteenth error is the statement on the second page of the press release which says that the only way reform in favour of country people could have occurred was through the measures that the Democrats advocated. It is clearly more than rhetoric; it is factually wrong. Reform could proceed in a large number of ways. One of the ways in which the Senate did proceed with reform was by passing the motion moved by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourteenth incorrect reference is to a Liberal-National Party charade. That is just inflated rhetoric which I believe to be false; there was no charade. Liberal and National Party senators who participated in the debate were sincere, substantial and actually put forward the only constructive resolution adopted by the Senate yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the fifteenth error is the reference to bluster. There was no element of bluster contained in the seven speeches made by the Liberal and National Party senators in the debate yesterday. I reject that assertion as false. The sixteenth error in the statement is a most offensive reference. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently the Liberals and the ALP believe country children can eat dirt. </PARA>
<PARA>What an offensive and obscene statement by a senator in this chamber! Does the honourable senator really want to come into this chamber and try to hold her head up and say that? It is patent nonsense and it is patently false. It is rhetoric so overblown that she has lost her mind. The seventeenth error occurs when she says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the rejection was doubly hypocritical because both Federal Liberal and Labor refused to provide any direct assistance to Australian farmers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What has been our policy with regard to the debate about the wool crisis? What has been our policy with regard to extending social security provisions, unemployment benefits or even our policy yesterday? To take just one example, I cite the motion that I moved on the Opposition's behalf to extend special provisions to farmers which would extend Austudy to those people involved in the rural crisis. It is factually incorrect to make such an assertion. It is manifestly false. </PARA>
<PARA> The eighteenth error refers to duplicity on behalf of the Labor and Liberal parties. I do not see such duplicity. That assertion is false. The nineteenth error concerns the assertion by Senator Lees that:</PARA>
<PARA>If they continue along this path there will be no farmers left by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA>That is patently false. The end of the decade is only nine years away. Whatever happens to this country and whatever debates are conducted in this chamber, there will be farmers at the end of the decade. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates that in the present extreme rural crisis some percentage of farmers-less than 10 per cent-may be forced to leave the land. That is an horrendously high number, but why can the Democrats not be factual instead of making overblown, false and alarmist statements-statements which can only add to the anxiety and distress in the rural areas of this country? The twentieth error in Senator Lees's statement is:</PARA>
<PARA>They will all have been sacrificed in the name of free trade theory. </PARA>
<PARA>What a load of hogwash! What nonsense! It is false. It is correct to say that both the present Government and the Opposition have been advocating for years in Europe and the United States, on behalf of rural producers in this country, that free trade be adopted in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks to enable fair access by efficient Australian farmers who want to sell their products into Europe and the United States where, as we know, there is an absence of free trade and an unfair protective barrier against the best interests of Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Every Australian farmer I know supports the bipartisan approach of the Liberal and Labor parties in attempting to achieve greater free trade so that farmers will benefit by being able to sell their products. What a load of nonsense from the Australian Democrat senator. For the twenty-first error, I come back to the title of the press release itself, `Austudy: Libs/Nats abandon farm students'. There was no such thing. The only positive resolution to come from yesterday's debate, after five hours in this chamber, was the Opposition's motion to extend benefits to farm students. That is the very opposite of abandoning them. </PARA>
<PARA> I found 21 errors on my first reading of this press release. I am now looking at it again and I find a twenty-second error. I do not want to bore the Senate. There is a reference to the coalition joining the Democrats to defeat the assets test on the family allowance which was proposed by the Government in the last Budget. It is arguable who joined who with regard to that. The opposition to the Government's initiative on that matter was as much a genuine decision of the Opposition as it was of any group of Democrats. If it were not for the numbers achieved by our working together, the Government's decision would not have been reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are number of other points of rhetoric and so on but for one two-page press release from one Democrat senator on one issue to contain 21 patently false assertions is the height of conduct by these populist and irresponsible Democrat senators in misleading the public. I say those words not lightly but with the same emphasis that I did in the debate yesterday. I say them to a person, Senator Lees, to whom I gave every opportunity to be in the Senate tonight to hear what I had to say, and on the basis that I have incorporated, in total, her press release for anyone to read and, for that matter, my own press release, independently written. I wish to say to Democrat senators that if such a pattern of false statements is made in public in an attempt to win some populist votes by deceit, they will get a debate not only in this chamber but around the country as well. I seek leave to incorporate the press release of Senator Lees. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTUDY: LIBS/NATS ABANDON</PARA>
<PARA>FARM STUDENTS</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National parties today rejected a move in the Senate by the Australian Democrats to make Austudy immediately available to students from many struggling farming and small business families. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats attempted to have genuine farm and small business assets exempted from inclusion in the assets test for the education allowance, but Liberal and National Senators voted with the ALP to defeat the move. </PARA>
<PARA>The rejection means that students from the majority of farming and country small business families will continue to be excluded from receiving Austudy despite the fact their parents' income for the next two years will be negligible if not negative. </PARA>
<PARA>South Australian Democrat Senator Meg Lees, who proposed the exemption move, said the rejection would make it very difficult for many country students to go on to upper secondary or tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lees said: ``What we see from both the Government and the Liberals is clever country rhetoric but a brick wall reality for country students. </PARA>
<PARA>``Both parties have voted to continue the current discriminatory system, which excludes some students from education allowances simply because of their parents' occupation and regardless of their parents' income. What chance do these kids have?''</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lees said the decision was the ultimate in false economies. She said the apparent rationale-to save a few dollars today-would have enormous costs in the long-term. Senator Lees said the Liberal education spokesman, Dr David Kemp, and a range of coalition speakers admitted the assets test was the cause of great problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Kemp said on May 8: ``The rural crisis has exposed a significant weakness in Austudy. Families with little or no real income are being excluded by the asset test from Austudy and as a result are having to withdraw their children from education.''</PARA>
<PARA>Yet when the Democrats had acted to rectify the fault identified by Dr Kemp, the Liberals voted against the move. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lees said part of the problem was the Liberals were paranoid about getting another bucketing from Paul Keating. [After the Democrats convinced the Coalition to join them and defeat the assets test proposed for the Family Allowance in the last Budget, Liberal leader Dr Hewson was savaged in the Parliament by Mr Keating for a lack of ``fiscal discipline''.]</PARA>
<PARA>``What we have seen is a desperate search by the Liberals for an excuse not to bite the bullet. The Liberals know its an anomaly, the ALP knows its an anomaly, yet they are paralysed by inaction,'' Senator Lees said. </PARA>
<PARA>``The Liberals first tried to suggest that it was not possible to disallow specific Austudy regulations and that the whole scheme would collapse if they supported the Democrats. When the fact that this was total nonsense was pointed out to them by the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, they started looking for another excuse. </PARA>
<PARA>``In typical `Yes Minister' tradition they put up a motion condemning the Government and called for another review. The last review of Austudy finished less than two months ago and pointed out many of the problems the Democrats were trying to fix today. </PARA>
<PARA>``THE ONLY WAY REFORM IN FAVOUR OF COUNTRY PEOPLE COULD HAVE OCCURRED TODAY WAS IF THE LIBERALS AND NATIONALS HAD VOTED WITH THE DEMOCRATS. INSTEAD THEY PREFERRED TO BLUSTER.''</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lees said the rejection continued the Liberal/National charade of concern for country people-just four months ago they also rejected a Democrat move to exempt farm assets from inclusion in assets test for Family Allowance Supplement (FAS). </PARA>
<PARA>``FAS is a tightly targeted payment aimed at very low income families introduced by the Government in 1987 to back up the Prime Minister's famous election promise that `no child will be living in poverty by 1990','' Senator Lees said. </PARA>
<PARA>``Apparently the Liberals and the ALP believe country children can eat dirt.''</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lees said the rejection was doubly hypocritical because both Federal Liberal and Labor refuse to provide any direct assistance to Australian farmers in the face of desperate calls from their State counterparts to act, arguing instead that all other countries should `internalise' their agricultural industry support-in other words, make it into direct `welfare payments' to the farmers concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>``Yet neither party is prepared to do the same here,'' Senator Lees said. </PARA>
<PARA>``They cannot have it both ways. The simple fact is country people continue to be denied the same rights as other ordinary Australians by the duplicity of the ALP, Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA>``If they continue along this path there will be no farmers left by the end of the decade. They will all have been sacrificed in the name of free trade theory.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats position on the Austudy assets test was supported by the National Farmers Federation and all the major State farming organisations, by grassroots rural action groups and the Students' Associations of the majority of Australian Universities. </PARA>
