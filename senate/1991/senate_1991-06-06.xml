<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The signatories to this petition ask that there be a comprehensive PUBLIC review of the AUSTUDY scheme. The aim of the review will be to establish a student income support scheme that is simple, promotes greater access and equity within Higher Education, and ensures a payment of an allowance at least equivalent to 100% of the poverty line, as estimated by the Australian Council of Social Services (ACOSS).</PARA>
<PARA> As part of this review we seek the following changes to AUSTUDY scheme:</PARA>
<PARA>1. A reduction in the age at which a student is automatically granted independent status from 25 to at most 21 years of age;</PARA>
<PARA>2. Raising the Personal Income Limit from $4,000 to $8,000;</PARA>
<PARA>3. Reinstating the Spouse Income Limit to $18,150;</PARA>
<PARA>4. Align Austudy rates of support to Unemployment Benefits;</PARA>
<PARA>5. The Previous Employment Rule for Independent Status be satisfied by 2 out of 3 years;</PARA>
<PARA>6. The introduction of a 4th course level for Associate Diplomas;</PARA>
<PARA>7. The re-introduction of the Incidentals Allowance.</PARA>

<PARA> That Fisheries Notices Nos. NPF 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 and No. ORF 15 made under section 8 of the Fisheries Act 1952, be disallowed.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These instruments appear to have drafting defects of a magnitude which make it appropriate to place a notice of disallowance upon them. The Committee believes that the drafting, presentation and access of delegated legislation should be of a standard not less than that of Acts. Anything less is a breach of parliamentary propriety. The principal difficulty is with a key clause in one of the notices which is then, in effect, incorporated in other notices thus tainting those others as well as the original. In addition, there are other drafting defects in the notices some of which could affect validity. For example, one notice was not signed. As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement of the concerns of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>FISHERIES NOTICES NOS. NPF 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 AND 14</PARA>
<PARA>All of these Notices, which prohibit the taking of prawns in certain areas subject to certain conditions, relate to the Northern Prawn Fishery. They all were made on 19 March 1991 and tabled on 16 May 1991, which was 14 sitting days later, or virtually at the end of the period during which tabling is required. The Committee normally waits until the end of the further 15 sitting days after tabling before giving a protective notice of motion of disallowance. However, on the present Sitting Pattern, this would be a date in August. This would mean that apparently defective instruments could be in operation for some five months before the Committee need have a satisfactory reply or, failing a satisfactory reply, be able to recommend appropriate action to the Senate. Accordingly, the Committee is giving notice for five sitting days hence, which will allow two weeks to resolve the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has suggested previously that it may be appropriate to reduce the time during which disallowable instruments of delegated legislation are required to be tabled from 15 sitting days to five. This would reduce the possibility of defective instruments being in force for months before the Committee obtains undertakings in respect of them.</PARA>
<PARA>The concerns of the Committee relate not to the substantive provisions of these instruments but to their form and drafting. It is a breach of parliamentary propriety if delegated legislation is defective in these areas. There is also the question of invalidity for uncertainty. Delegated legislation, which is necessarily made under the authority of an Act of Parliament, must not be drafted to a lesser standard than Acts.</PARA>
<PARA>In Fisheries Notice NPF 9 one paragraph is drafted in such an ambiguous way that it is not possible to tell whether it effects its stated purpose. This is important, because it is a key provision, referred to and in effect incorporated by later provisions of the same Notice and by provisions of NPF 10, 11 and 12 and probably 13 and 14. Therefore, all of these instruments appear similarly defective. There is also a typographical error in NPF 9.</PARA>
<PARA>Fisheries Notice NPF 11 refers in one provision to ``proclaimed waters referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5''. There is no reference to proclaimed waters in paragraph 4. It appears that the provision should have referred to paragraphs 5 and 6.</PARA>
<PARA>Fisheries Notice NPF 12 refers in one provision to ``activities prohibited by paragraph 4''. There are no activities prohibited by paragraph 4. It appears that the provision should have referred to paragraphs 5 or 6 or both. NPF 12 refers in another provision to ``periods specified in paragraph 4''. There are no periods specified in paragraph 4. It appears that the provision should have referred to paragraph 5.</PARA>
<PARA>Fisheries Notices NPF 13 and 14 refer to ``equipment as defined in Fisheries Notice No.NPF 9'', without further qualification. Virtually every one of the substantive provisions of NPF 9 defines equipment, as does the interpretation provision and a schedule. It is assumed that the key paragraph of NPF 9 is meant, but as described earlier that provision is defective. In any event, the cross-reference should be made specific.</PARA>
<PARA>In NPF 14 a provision refers to ``proclaimed waters referred to in paragraphs 4 and 6''. There are no references to proclaimed waters in either of these paragraphs but there are such references in paragraphs 5 and 7.</PARA>
<PARA>FISHERIES NOTICE NO. ORF 15</PARA>
<PARA>This Notice, one of 12 Fisheries Notices tabled on 16 May 1991, refers to the Orange Roughy Fishery. It was not signed. All of the other Notices tabled on that day, and the other 10 Fisheries Notices and Plans of Management made this year, all carry facsimiles of separate signatures by the Minister, together with a hand written date. In ORF 15 there is a blank space where the facsimile signature usually appears, although the date is hand written as usual. Therefore, there is at least a presumption that the instrument was never signed and is of no effect.</PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908. The amendments do not reflect major changes in policy by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The Quarantine Act provides that the expenses of keeping goods in quarantine until such time as the risk of the introduction of diseases and pests can be assessed as minimal are a legal charge against the goods. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it is unclear whether the Quarantine Act permits the enforcement of that legal charge against the goods by their retention and sale or whether the Commonwealth must surrender the goods to their owners when the goods have completed their quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly these amendments provide that the Commonwealth may retain possession of the goods, over which it holds a statutory legal charge, until such time as:</PARA>
<PARA>* the expenses owing for quarantine have been paid;</PARA>
<PARA>* suitable arrangements have been made by the owner for payment of the expenses; or</PARA>
<PARA>* as a last resort, the Commonwealth may sell the goods and apply the proceeds of the sale to the debt owing to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments are necessary because the Commonwealth has been deprived of substantial revenue by owners or importers not paying their lawful debts for quarantine services. That situation is to be avoided in future. </PARA>
<PARA>As an example of the revenue lost, there was a recent case where valuable animals that had undergone extensive quarantine had to be released and the Commonwealth is in the position of suing for the recovery of $1.5m with little likelihood of recovering the full amount. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, another large program known as the scrapie freedom assurance program, which involves a large number of animals held in quarantine for many years to address risks presented by diseases which are slow to appear, is coming to an end. The animals involved in this program are quarantined in various places throughout Australia and have attracted substantial highly subsidised charges of up to $900,000 for services provided by the Commonwealth in ensuring that the animals are free from disease and may be released for breeding purposes. The animals are due for release early in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>Although highly subsidised valuable services have been provided by the Commonwealth over a period of approximately seven years, the importers have disputed the outstanding debt. These amendments allowing the Commonwealth to retain possession of the animals will ensure that the Commonwealth's bargaining position over payment of the debt is not weakened. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the amendments apply to any goods undergoing quarantine now or in the future</PARA>
<PARA>* not just to the animals in the scrapie freedom assurance program. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments add a new provision to the Act enabling the Commonwealth and the owner to enter into an agreement about the payment of quarantine expenses.</PARA>
<PARA>In the event that agreement cannot be reached, the owner's rights over the goods are well protected by the provision requiring the Commonwealth to serve a notice advising that if, at the end of 30 days after the notice is given to the owner of the goods, any expenses relating to quarantine are still outstanding, the goods may be sold. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill has no financial impact but will allow the Commonwealth to more easily enforce payment of charges for quarantine services. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>One purpose of this Bill is to make a number of amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of these amendments will clarify the intent of `professional service' as defined in Section 3 of the Health Insurance Act, by introducing the notion of ``clinical relevance'' to that definition. Technically, as the legislation currently stands, a medical practitioner could itemise an account and claim Medicare benefits for a service where a physical attendance on the patient occurs, but during which no ``clinically relevant service'' takes place. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendment requires that a ``professional service'' be related to a medical examination, treatment, diagnosis or test that is necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 4 of the Bill has the purpose of specifying explicitly what has previously been implicit in the current legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the changes in clauses 5 and 6 of this Bill is to require the proprietor of a pathology laboratory, the approval for which has been revoked, to take all reasonable steps to inform the providing practitioner and the patient that a Medicare benefit will not be payable in respect of the pathology service, and to require the Minister to advertise such a decision. </PARA>
<PARA>Medicare benefits for pathology services are only payable where a number of criteria are met. One of these is that the laboratory premises where the services are rendered must meet certain standards. These standards are defined by the Minister and are adopted from standards and guidelines set by the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council. The Commonwealth contracts an independent organisation-the National Association of Testing Authorities-to carry out assessment of these premises. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been occasions recently where pathology laboratories have failed to reach an acceptable standard of operation and the approval has been revoked. The Department has become aware that the operators of some of these revoked premises have continued to perform pathology services without informing either the referring practitioners or the patients. (No charges have been raised against the patient.)</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions in these clauses are similar to those offences relating to the disqualification of a practitioner in section l9D of the Health Insurance Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>A further purpose of this Bill is to make a number of amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act 1986 in relation to nursing home matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains a measure to facilitate the release of information about nursing homes to the public. The secrecy provisions of the National Health Act currently prevent, in most cases, the release of any information about a person or a nursing home collected in the course of administering the Act. This has the effect of making it extremely difficult for the Department or the Minister to give out any information at all about nursing homes to prospective residents, current residents or to members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA>This new measure will enable necessary information to be made available to the public, while at the same time preserving the privacy of individual nursing home residents and the proprietor's right to a review of the information except in urgent circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Three types of information will be able to be released if this Bill is passed. Firstly, the Bill enables the public release of the action plans prepared by a nursing home indicating how the home will be improved so as to meet the prescribed standards of care. Action plans apply to homes that have been found not to meet the standards, and are the proprietor's indication of the changes to be made in the practices of that home. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the Bill enables release of basic facts about a nursing home: its name, address, number of beds, fees charged and similar descriptive information necessary if a person wants to make an informed choice about a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, the Bill enables release of information concerning action that is to be taken to suspend or revoke a nursing home's approval, or to vary the conditions of its approval, or to suspend benefits for new admissions to that home. Proprietors will have 30 days to make submissions to the Minister about this information, except where the situation is urgent. If urgent release of information is necessary to protect the welfare or interests of residents, then such information may be released immediately. In most cases this will occur where a home is being closed down, and it is necessary to give advance warning to the residents, their families, the staff, other nursing homes or hospitals, and State health authorities that the residents have to be moved. </PARA>
<PARA>A further measure in this Bill provides an additional sanction which may be used in regard to a nursing home that has breached one or more conditions of its approval. Currently, the only available sanction is the suspension or revocation of approval of the home. This is a drastic penalty, which is only imposed as a last resort, as it severely disrupts the lives of the residents who have to be transferred elsewhere. This Bill enables Commonwealth benefits to be stopped for any new admissions occurring after the date of determination that the conditions have been breached. This penalises the nursing home while at the same time enables the care of existing residents to continue. This sanction is already available for use when standards of care are not met; this measure extends this sanction to apply to breaches of any of the conditions of approval. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains some technical amendments to enable proclamation of a section of a 1986 Act concerning the listing of Government nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the amendments proposed under Part 5 of the Bill. These will introduce more flexible arrangements for the administration of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Such as decentralising the administration of the Individual Patient Usage Scheme, and making it possible for evaluation fees to be paid in instalments by sponsors seeking to include goods in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. </PARA>
<PARA>The Individual Patient Usage (IPU) Scheme has been in operation for more than 10 years, to cover situations where there is a genuine need to treat a patient with a drug which has not been approved for supply in Australia. Such situations can be divided into two broad categories. </PARA>
<PARA>One category covers situations where a patient is suffering from a disease rarely seen in Australia, treatable by a well-recognised drug which no drug company wishes to market routinely in Australia. In such cases, approval to use the drug in question would be routinely given under the IPU Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The other category covers cases of urgent clinical need, where a patient is suffering from a serious disease which is either incurable by routinely available drugs, or which has failed to respond to such drugs. In such cases, approval to use an unproven drug on an experimental basis may be given, provided there is some scientific rationale for such treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the present scheme, IPU approvals have been administered centrally. Any doctor seeking such approval must telephone a Medical Officer of the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Canberra, who decides such applications in accordance with criteria designed to take account of the factors I have mentioned. Two problems with this centralised system have emerged in recent years. Firstly, the volume of requests is now running at some twenty thousand per annum, and secondly, the growing complexity of medical practice has made it increasingly difficult for Medical Officers in Canberra, on the basis of a telephone call, to weigh up the pros and cons of using an unregistered drug. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has therefore decided to make provision for IPU approvals to be delegated, under Regulations to be made for this purpose, to doctors outside the Australian Public Service-in general, to specific staff members of major hospitals. The general criteria which they will use will be the same as those used in the centralised Scheme (which will continue as an alternative). The doctor granting IPU approval will always be someone other than the prescriber, and the arrangement in each hospital will be under the general supervision of the hospital's ethics committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 5 of the Bill also contains amendments providing for Regulations to be made to introduce a scheme that will allow sponsors to pay their evaluation fees by instalments when they apply to register their products in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). This measure follows a recommendation of the Industry and Government Consultative Committee, established to advise the Minister on the schedule of fees and charges to be paid in connection with the manufacture of therapeutic goods, and the inclusion and retention of goods in the ARTG. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes will also be made to alter the effect of the Secretary's action in grouping therapeutic goods under Part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act. At present this is to render a whole group of goods that have been grouped to be single goods for the purposes of Part 3 of that Act. However this creates difficulties in cases where only one product within a group may be required to be withdrawn from the market, yet the cancellation provisions under the Act must be applied to all the goods in the same group where they are treated as ``single therapeutic goods''. To overcome this and similar difficulties, the changes proposed will mean that individual goods that have been grouped will retain their status as separate goods, but will only be identified as belonging to a particular group warranting common or uniform treatment for certain purposes such as the payment of fees and charges, and the assignment of a common registration or listing number in the ARTG. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amendments included in Part 5 of the Bill deal with the introduction of fees, comparable to those payable under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, for processing the release of information in the ARTG to the public. Provision is also made to allow sponsors to apply, upon payment of a fee, to alter conditions attaching to the registration or listing of their goods in the ARTG where such alterations require further processing by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and for the lodgement and supply of information under the Act by electronic means. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>THERAPEUTIC GOODS (CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is to be considered cognately with the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 (The Portfolio Bill). The amendments contained in this Bill arise as a consequence of amendments being made to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 by the Portfolio Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Portfolio Bill makes a number of amendments to Part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act. One of these relates to the effect of the secretary exercising his power to make Determinations to group therapeutic goods where, for example, they share common characteristics or where they share both common characteristics and a common manufacturer. At present, the effect of grouping therapeutic goods under section 16 of the Therapeutic Goods Act is to render each group of goods to be single goods for a range of administrative and other purposes under Part 3 of that Act including the application of charges. Thus, for example, each group of goods entered in the Register by the same person is treated as single goods and attracts one annual registration or listing charge. </PARA>
<PARA>However, following amendments to be introduced by the Portfolio Bill, the effect of the Secretary's action in grouping goods will no longer be to render such goods ``single goods''. Instead, each product included within the same group will retain their separate status as individual goods, and will only be identified as belonging to a particular Gazetted Therapeutic Goods Group, or a Gazetted Therapeutic Devices Group so as to attract, amongst the same group of goods, common or uniform treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>To preserve the policy intention that grouped goods should continue to attract only a single annual charge, rather than an annual charge for each product included in a group of goods that is separately registered or listed, amendments to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989 are necessary to achieve this result and to match the changes made by the Portfolio Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>HEALTH LEGISLATION (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before the Senate amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953 to implement substantial reforms to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) which were announced in the 1990 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes to the administration of the Scheme involve the introduction of a checking system whereby pharmacists will be connected on-line to the Health Insurance Commission's (HIC) computer, or more correctly, the Commission's eligibility file, to allow immediate verification of a patient's entitlement to either free pharmaceutical benefits, concessional benefits or general benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>No one would deny, not even the Opposition, the right of the Government to protect taxpayers' money, in providing that only those eligible to receive benefits do in fact receive them. To do no less would be scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA>Since November 1986 pharmacists have had the responsibility to satisfy themselves that the person claiming a benefit under the PBS was in fact entitled to that benefit. The introduction of the new checking system is but one more way for pharmacists to satisfy themselves that the benefit being claimed is legitimate. This system provides a level of accuracy not possible before. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the new system, the pharmacist seeks confirmation from the HIC's eligibility file that the benefit the patient is claiming is one to which that person is entitled. Clearly the pharmacist can satisfy himself or herself as to the patient's claim in any number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA>The patient may be well known to the pharmacist; the patient may tender any number of current cards provided by the Department of Social Security to prove eligibility to a benefit. The patient could tender a Medicare card or a passport. All might satisfy the pharmacist and in such cases many pharmacists may choose not to use the on-line system to check eligibility. Where the on-line system is used, however, the pharmacist is guaranteed payment at the level indicated by the HIC's system. This guarantee applies even if HIC's eligibility file is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me expand on that point. The HIC eligibility file is not a new one. It is a file of information currently available to the HIC. It is information that has been and is still used to check the eligibility of persons receiving dispensed prescriptions, but this check presently occurs only after the benefit has been supplied. While recovery action would be undertaken by the HIC in the most blatant cases of wrongful claiming, a post examination system like this is clearly inefficient and unsatisfactory. The Commonwealth Auditor-General has already pointed this out in a report on the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA>The eligibility file is currently made up of data provided under law by the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs and the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>On-line eligibility testing is to be extended to cover testing of eligibility for participation in the PBS generally. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill makes it clear that Australian taxpayers are only going to pay for pharmaceutical benefits supplied to those persons who have a legitimate right to those benefits and that benefits will only be available to eligible residents of this country. Thus the flow of taxpayer-subsidised drugs to persons either overseas or just passing though this country is to stop. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligibility to pharmaceutical benefits will be limited to those persons who can receive the benefits of the Australian health system through Medicare. I make no apology for this move for surely no one would argue that the Australian taxpayer should be asked to foot the bill for drugs provided to overseas visitors and residents of other countries. The generous subsidies available under the PBS for expensive medications like insulin and ACE inhibitors mean that losses to the Australian community from abuse by tourists can be significant. </PARA>
<PARA>What changes will pharmacy customers experience? They may not even notice any change, for the pharmacist, while preparing the prescription, will call up the eligibility file on-line by entering the patient's basic details, that is, those that are already on the prescription prepared by the patient's doctor. The pharmacist will be provided with one of only four messages and this is a very important point for those of us with a serious intention to protect privacy to note. The messages will be that the patient has general entitlement; a concessional entitlement; entitlement to pharmaceutical benefits without charge; or that there is no record of the patient. Even if this information is wrong the pharmacist will be paid the full amount applicable. </PARA>
<PARA>If the patient disagrees with the level of entitlement indicated on-line, the pharmacist can choose to accept the further evidence the patient might tender or charge the patient the applicable higher rate, pointing out that the patient has under these provisions a right to a refund if the claim is later proven. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that under the provisions of this Bill the patient is still protected against the high cost of pharmaceutical drugs. If a patient is not recorded as being eligible for free or concessional drugs the most that a pharmacist can charge is $15, provided that the patient is registered with Medicare. Even if the patient is not so registered the most a pharmacist can charge is the Commonwealth price for any listed drug. This price is the price the manufacturer and the Minister have agreed will be the price to pharmacists, plus the mark-ups and fees determined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, which are added to the base cost. </PARA>
<PARA>Should a patient later be able to prove eligibility to general, concessional or free benefits, the provisions in the Bill will permit the patient to receive from the Commission a refund of the difference between what the patient paid and the correct price. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to a very important issue, but one which has been somewhat dishonestly exploited in the debate on these PBS reforms. I refer of course to the issue of privacy. This Government is committed to ensuring that Australians are protected from misuse of personal data collected in the course of the administration of Government programs. It has enacted privacy legislation and appointed a Privacy Commissioner and in relation to the PBS not only abides by the information privacy principles provided for under the Privacy Act but is also governed by very strict secrecy provisions of the National Health Act. The information to be made available to pharmacists to enable them to be guaranteed that they will be paid the full amount of the benefit they provide to a customer is, as I have described and as is set out under the definition of status information in the Bill, very limited information. Indeed, it tells a pharmacist less about a person than many other sources of information currently provided by claimants and certainly less than the pharmacist probably already knows because of the professional health care relationship involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet, the introduction of these eligibility checking arrangements has been the subject of much debate and concern. To understand why we need to consider particular historical and timing factors. The Government's announcement in the Budget last year of an on-line checking system followed an earlier proposal from the Health Insurance Commission for a fully interactive system involving two-way transmission of information and uncertainties about whether data from the Medicare and PBS programs would be kept separate. In addition the precise nature of the information to be provided to pharmacists on-line was not then fully specified. </PARA>
<PARA>The announcement was also contemporaneous with others involving the use of data-matching and Tax File Number collection and although these were for different programs and purposes there was some understandable early confusion.</PARA>
<PARA>All that is behind us now, I am pleased to say. </PARA>
<PARA>We now know that the status information is tightly defined and limited and that it will go only one way, from the HIC to the pharmacist. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that the information to be provided by the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs to the HIC will be similarly tightly defined and limited and will certainly not contain Tax File Number information. </PARA>
<PARA>And through the constructive and detailed involvement of the Privacy Commissioner it has been decided that guidelines will be developed to ensure that improper entry into the HIC's data base will be made impossible; such guidelines to be agreed between HIC and the Privacy Commissioner under section 27 of the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Privacy Commissioner and the HIC will also review and, if necessary, strengthen and make more specific, procedures within the HIC for maintaining the functional separation of Medicare claims and PBS claims data. </PARA>
<PARA>As to the area of particular concern to some patients; the in-pharmacy interaction between pharmacists and their patients about eligibility matters, The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has accepted the recommendation of the Privacy Commissioner that there should be a set of standards developed between his office and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia for inclusion in the pharmacists' professional code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA>The final provisions of the Bill will require all pharmacists to submit their claims for reimbursement to the Commission electronically. This is just the final step in the introduction of this most desirable change. </PARA>
<PARA>No one could claim that the Government has not foreshadowed that it has wanted to introduce this measure. We first introduced electronic transfers of claims in 1986 with an incentive payment to encourage participation. This scheme was very successful and over 50 per cent of pharmacists took up the offer. The numbers of pharmacists transmitting claims data via the Claims Transmission System (CTS) has continued to grow even though pharmacists joining the System since late 1988 have not been eligible for incentive payments. </PARA>
<PARA>But not all pharmacists have taken up the system. This is perhaps understandable in some cases where the pharmacist was waiting for and has now applied for the amalgamation or closure packages presently available and such pharmacists are excluded from these provisions. Clearly those pharmacists who are already receiving additional support under the PBS because of isolation will not be required to join the CTS and the Bill makes provision for those pharmacists for whom it is impractical because of power supplies or line difficulties to be connected to the CTS to make application to the Secretary of the Department of Community Services and Health for an exemption because of their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore the Government has, in a package of measures aimed at assisting with the completion of universality of this system, agreed to a payment of $1000 to each pharmacist joining the CTS to assist with the initial cost and payments of $250 to assist those pharmacists who may need to upgrade their computer facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Pharmacists currently submitting manual claims will further gain through shorter payment times and the increased accuracy the system offers. </PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated that prevention of the free flow of drugs to destinations overseas and to those not eligible here in Australia will save the community $6 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligibility testing is estimated to save in the order of $12 million in 1991/92, $34 million in 1992/93 and $40 million each year thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure will amount to $12.7 million in 1991-92, $14.8 million in 1992/93, $13.7 million in 1993/94 and $14.2 million in 1994/95. </PARA>
<PARA>The extension of the CTS to all pharmacists will save the Government a further $6 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>These reforms underscore the Government's commitment to responsible financial management while maintaining the protection this Scheme offers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Telecommunications Bill 1991 and related Bills on telecommunications issues which we have before us this morning are very important pieces of legislation. This legislation package could greatly advance Australia's economic recovery and will affect every one of us in a very great way. Telecommunications is the very foundation of our Australian way of life in the late twentieth century and without telecommunications, the business, government and social fabric of this country would grind to a halt. But it has been widely recognised, both within and outside the industry, that our telecommunications industry, to become internationally competitive and to keep up with the rapid technological changes which are taking place, requires urgent and extensive reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition-the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia-supported the Government's initial tentative moves in this direction in 1989 when it introduced the Australian Telecommunications Bill, although, quite justifiably, we criticised its limitations which were evident even then. We will be supporting in principle this package of telecommunications legislation which has been introduced in 1991, with the exception of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporations Bill 1991, which brings about a merger of Telecom and OTC Ltd and sets up a new regulatory regime. I will elaborate the reasons for our not supporting that later. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, I stress that these Bills are a step in the right direction, a step forward that we in the coalition have been advocating for a long time. The primary Telecommunications Bill provides for network competition and full competition in all other services, the licensing of the general and mobile telecommunications service providers, access rights of licence holders to networks and services of other licensees, a scheme of payment by the carriers for universal obligations and an enhanced role for Austel-the Australian Telecommunications Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, the Government has not gone far enough. It has not the fortitude to make any decisions which are necessary to put this country back on the rails but which might be a bit difficult or unpleasant because they involve stepping on the toes of its union mates. The only so-called difficult decisions this Government has made are those which, although making it unpopular with some sections of the community, are not detrimental to its masters in the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills being debated today reflect the dead hand of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. That is why the Government has neither the courage to make the telecommunications industry truly competitive nor the inclination to ensure that its capital base is secured with a sound commercial structure. Instead, the Government is creating a one-sided duopoly, whose regulator, Austel Pty Ltd, remains firmly under government control. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills are really nothing more than a cobbled together bundle of legislation that is yet another example of this Government's incompetence, ineptitude and hypocrisy. When it is not too busy squabbling over its leadership, this Labor Government spends its time trying to appease its union mates. The introduction of these Bills presents a unique opportunity for Australia to become a world leader in telecommunications, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, but their structure is such that the new telecommunications organisation, Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC), which will emerge from this legislation, will be badly hampered by the lack of realistic competition, flexibility and capital input and will indeed suffer severe capital shortfall because of the proposed merger fee that Telecom will be forced to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that telecommunications must be the fastest growing and most rapidly changing industry in the world today. It is essential that the Australian telecommunications industry is given both the opportunity and the ability to keep up with the globalisation of telecommunications that is taking place. It cannot afford to be hampered by outmoded and short-sighted legislation which has suffered because its architects were playing politics amongst themselves rather than looking to the national interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia already has a good reputation in this field and is uniquely positioned to expand into the Asian market. The Asia-Pacific region, although a fast growing industrial community, is nevertheless underdeveloped in its telecommunications structure. To illustrate this, it is interesting to note that in Australia there is one telecommunications line for every two people. New Zealand and Japan reflect a similar figure. But in Indonesia there is only one line for 200 people and in China it is only one line for 500 people. When one considers the huge populations of those countries, some 175 million in Indonesia and 1.1 billion in China, it is possible to see the vast opportunities that await the industry there, as their economies grow and demand for telecommunications facilities multiplies. Not only are we geographically well placed to expand into this region, but we also have much of the technology needed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, telecommunications is changing rapidly. To keep pace with those technological changes, enormous amounts of capital outlay will be required. However, the structure of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1991 is such that the new corporation will be denied the flexibility to cope with twenty-first century technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look first at the question of competition-or rather the lack of it-which the Government is attempting to introduce in this legislation. It has always been the philosophical political base of those on our side of the chamber that free market forces are the best way to achieve economic efficiencies. Even the Australian Labor Party has come, albeit belatedly and reluctantly, to adopt this view, although, I might add, on a very selective basis. It was for this reason that the Labor Government finally decided to dismantle the airline duopoly which existed up until October last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government realised that a duopoly does not create true competition. We ended up with a two-airline scenario where timetables and fares were identical and the travelling public had no real choice. Yet here we have the Government proposing just such a duopoly for our telecommunications industry, except that even that will be a very one-sided duopoly. One of the players, AOTC, will be a giant corporation with certain vital advantages over its competitor, the new duopolist. The new competitor will have to purchase the debt-ridden Aussat to be in the running and it will have to purchase its core delivery services from its competitor, AOTC, which will have delivery rights as well as distribution rights. </PARA>
<PARA> That seems to me to be a very unbalanced situation. It is unreasonable, I believe, to assume that there will be any leeway for real competition in such a structure. It falls far short of the micro-economic reform which this Government claims to be striving to achieve. It certainly did not happen with the two-airline agreement and I cannot see how it will possibly happen in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed duopoly will be established by licence under ministerial negotiation. The licence will guarantee that there will be no other competition beyond the duopoly until 1997-a period of some five or more years. At the same time, many of the details, such as the licence conditions, definition of basic carriage services, the fees for interconnection services, environmental protection provisions, and even the fee that Telecom will be obliged to pay for the purchase of OTC, are not highlighted in this legislation. Rather, they are to be decided by ministerial discretion and regulation, after the legislation is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition are very concerned about the lack of true competition, and we give notice that when we win government-as we most assuredly will after the next election-we will open up this duopoly to further competition before 1997. We will not feel compelled to pay any compensation for the changes that we initiate. So, we put firmly on notice now for any potential bidder wishing to be involved in this duopoly, that when we come to office it will in fact be open competition that we will introduce. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that any change to the duopoly by a coalition government will be undertaken only after consultation with the duopolists and there will be no unilateral negation by legislation of existing agreements. The coalition is committed, as part of its program to achieve full and effective competition, to the privatisation of Telecom. Privatisation will ensure that AOTC has the ability to raise the additional capital it will need to accommodate the technological changes it will be required to make. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom, by its own admission in a submission to the Department of Finance last month, is in financial strife; a liquidity squeeze is, I believe, the expression that Telecom used. This was part of the rationale given for an increase in local telephone charges announced recently. If one does not believe what Telecom itself has said, one has only to look at its debt equity position to realise its precarious position. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared to other major players in international telecommunications, Telecom Australia fares badly. Its debt ratio figure is 53 per cent. The debt ratio figure for British Telecom, by comparison, which is often touted as an example, is only 36 per cent. The figure for Bell Canada is 40 per cent; Bell South, 39 per cent; Telecom New Zealand, 32 per cent; and the figure for Cable and Wireless from the United Kingdom is a low 23 per cent. By comparison, the newly merged Telecom-OTC, as a result of this legislation, will have a debt ratio figure of 51 per cent, which is only slightly better than the figure for the existing Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is not enough, we should look at another financial indicator, and I refer to interest rate cover comparisons; that is, the profit before interest and income tax expense divided by the total interest. For Telecom Australia, the figure is a dangerously low 2, compared to Telecom New Zealand's 3.2, Bell South's 4.2, British Telecom's 6.6, and the figure of 7.4 for Cable and Wireless. Again, the new structure, at 2.4, will be only marginally better than the existing Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> By both measures, Telecom and its successor compare unfavourably with its international competitors and both its debt ratio and interest cover must be improved if it is to compete successfully internationally. However, to give credit where it is due, the Government has to some extent recognised this and has converted some of Telecom's debt to equity-about $1,088m worth. But as usual, and as is typical of this Government, it simply does not go far enough. With its proposal to impose a fee of $1 billion to $1.5 billion on Telecom for the purchase of OTC, in effect, it is taking back with one hand what it has given with the other. Not only is Telecom's ability to raise further funds severely hampered with this sort of balance sheet but its immediate capital assets will be severely depleted if it has to pay this merger fee. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite a healthy cash flow, Telecom has to invest in an enormous capital expenditure program if it is to avoid being left behind in the telecommunications industry. This present Hawke Labor Government has indicated it is not prepared to put extra money into Telecom. The coalition is not suggesting for one moment that it should be up to the hard-pressed Australian taxpayers to bail out yet another struggling Government institution. Telecom is also constrained from raising further loans because it is subject to Loan Council ceilings. The only way left for Telecom to raise extra funds is from private investment and that means privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The major flaws in this legislation are the failure to provide for the present and future capital needs of AOTC and the restriction of the provision for future privatisation. But, of course, this Labor Government is not prepared to privatise Telecom because its union mates and, in particular, the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA), are ideologically opposed to it. They are opposed to privatisation because they are afraid of having to compete in the marketplace outside the protection of a public sector monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> If Telecom is not provided with additional funding to enable it to capitalise on the opportunities now before it, it is destined to become moribund and that will mean job losses both for ATEA members and for unions in a host of associated industries. It could well be that the ultimate effect of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill will be the negation of gains in micro-economic reform, limited as they are, that have been made in the parent Bill, the Telecommunications Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The air of uncertainty enveloping this legislation is a minefield for every individual concerned with technology. This atmosphere is not helped by the fact that Austel, as the industry regulator, will remain under Government control and will be subject to ministerial direction. It remains a matter of great concern to us in the Opposition that Austel will be acting as an instrument of government rather than as an independent arbitrator. We are concerned, for example, that the fees for the interconnect service will be set by Austel, outside the legislation itself, at a level that suits government revenue raising requirements rather than at realistic market rates based on cost efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> We would not like to see the fee structure used as a means to indefinitely prop up an inefficient competitor. The fees charged should ultimately be a matter of negotiation between the parties directly concerned. The coalition would prefer to see Austel making full and complete reports to the Parliament rather than to an individual Minister. Austel must have the mettle to be effective and it must not allow any carrier to ride roughshod over it, as Telecom has been known to do in the past. It is essential that Austel be allowed to carry out its competitive charter and for that reason its independence is a matter of vital importance. There is too much detail which is unspecified and which is left to the discretion of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the matter of interconnect fees, there is the Minister's discretion with regard to the granting of licences. The Minister is empowered to make a decision to grant or refuse a licence without explanation. The Minister may also make a written agreement with a carrier that will provide for the payment of compensation by the Commonwealth if it should contravene the agreement. There are far too many grey areas and far too many questions requiring answers, some of which I have already touched upon, such as questions regarding the licensing provisions, definitions of service and details of fees to be charged. </PARA>
<PARA> But what about the proposal for pay television on which the Government also seems to be unable to reach a decision? What about the third mobile licence? When will that eventuate? It is the coalition's view that the issuing of a licence for a third mobile carrier is a matter of utmost priority. The advent of mobile telephones is perhaps one of the most popular if not the fastest growth area in telecommunications. The demand for mobile telephones is escalating and costs are coming down. </PARA>
<PARA> I contend, and I am certainly not alone in this belief, that the humble telephone connected to a wall socket will be a thing of the past in just a few years. As the convenience of being able to be reached at any time in any place becomes an accepted part of life, the demand for mobile telephones will exceed supply if networks are not expanded. It is irrelevant whether they are regional licences or just one national licence; the fact remains that there must be greater scope for expansion with an additional mobile telephone network. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the consideration of consumer interests. The coalition believes that Austel should have stronger direction to protect the public interest. On the question of timed local calls, the definition of a business is not sufficiently clear. I am particularly concerned about rural customers. I am not criticising the present service by Telecom to the rural sector, but I am gravely concerned that new provisions after 1993 for delivery of the carrier service to the first telephone socket or the first main distribution frame on a property will severely disadvantage isolated properties. It could make installation fees for a new service on large rural properties prohibitive. We cannot avoid community service obligations, but the provision of community services must be specifically highlighted and their costs fairly apportioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I have outlined in some detail the areas of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill which are causing me concern and which I am unable to support. All of the amendments which the Opposition will be moving at the second reading and committee stages, and which I heartily support, seek to redress at least some of the imbalances and inefficiencies inherent in the legislation. In line with our stated policy for the achievement of full and effective com- petition, our amendments will move to allow open competition earlier than is provided in the Government's legislation. Our amendments condemn the structure of the Bill as not meeting the intent of greater competition and privatisation. They delete the clause which limits the ability of the Government to sell shares in AOTC. They reject the concept of a merger fee. They require the tabling of financial statements and a memorandum and articles of association prior to commencement and they criticise AOTC's capital structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already explained why the Opposition is moving these amendments, and I just remind honourable senators that if these amendments are not supported we will be left with a scrabble bag of legislation which falls far short of meeting even the Government's stated aims of making our telecommunications industry truly competitive. We will end up with a government owned and controlled megastructure, the capital base of which will be sadly depleted and which will be unable to fund the ongoing modernisation which is so vital to Australia's participation in the globalisation of telecommunications. It will mean yet another missed opportunity for Australia, an opportunity that favourably awaits us if only we have the will and the vision to utilise it. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that this legislation is a valuable chance for Australia to build the foundations of a new export industry which could make a significant contribution to our economic salvation. To permit this legislation passage in its present form would be a great tragedy for this industry.  We would be failing in our duty as an opposition if we were to allow this Government to take the money and run and, in so doing, to fall short of its obligations to achieve micro-economic reform. As I said, while the Opposition will not be opposing this Bill in the second reading stage, it will certainly be moving an amendment in that stage and significant amendments in the committee stage. I wholeheartedly support and commend the amendments which we will be moving and I urge the Senate to wholeheartedly support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly to the Telecommunications Bill and allied Bills and not canvass the matters that have already been canvassed thus far. The Bills as they are presented to us are an attempt to reflect the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) late last year that it was the decision of the Government to promote competition and dynamism in the telecommunications industry; to guarantee community service obligations in telecommunications; to maintain quality of telecommunications services; to maintain Telecom Australia and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission in full public ownership; and to maintain maximum possible Australian ownership in the industry to ensure the effective regulation and to remove from Telecom and OTC all government imposed constraints which limit their ability to respond effectively to competition and which do not serve the broader national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of those particular objectives, many of them, or perhaps all of them, are unexceptionable. I am not too sure, however, that the Bill takes full cognisance of those principles in some respects. Most speakers have indicated the enormous effect that the telecommunications industry has on the general public and will have on the daily lives of individuals. It already has a considerable influence on individuals, and of course that influence will grow over the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the case, if that is accepted all round the chamber, the question must be asked as to why one area is not specifically attended to in this legislation. That area impinges on the principle contained in the statement of the Prime Minister and the Minister-that is, that the policy should guarantee community service obligations in telecommunications, that it should serve the broader national interests and that it should protect the consumer. Therefore, why are there not specific provisions in this legislation that will deal with a code of practice to be observed by Telecom and OTC and the other player in the game-in other words, the two carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to widespread community concerns about the material content now provided by service providers through Telecom lines in the areas of computer pornography and 0055 services. There has been a great deal of debate in this chamber, and more particularly in the community, about the nature of these services and whether they are appropriate-whether it is appropriate that carriers such as Telecom and now the other carrier should be used as agents for material which is exploitative of women, harmful to those receiving it and, irrespective of what people say, not able to be kept from particularly the young and immature in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter had been considered by Telecom. Telecom in fact had contracts with service providers which were quite specific. Those contracts with service providers established certain message standards. I quote from 0055 operational requirements, which is an attachment to the contract with the service providers. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Standard 1.1</PARA>
<PARA>(a) This standard has been prepared with regard to the following principle:-</PARA>
<PARA>That all persons calling any 0055 Information Service are entitled to protection from exposure to messages of an indecent, obscene or sexually suggestive nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The Service Provider will not provide ``knowingly or negligently'' on any 0055 number allocated to it, any information which in any way may be interpreted as indecent, obscene, offensive or sexually titillating or denoting sexual suggestion or sexual fantasy. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. These are the attachments to the agreements made between Telecom and the service providers. However, because of certain amendments to legislation which occurred in 1989 and which took out some of the provisions of the 1975 legislation, there is some doubt as to whether the requirements under those agreements can be enforced. Frankly, it is important to put that well beyond doubt. It is also important to tackle the question of computer porn, which is again extremely exploitative of women, and it is certainly not in the public interest that the communications services of the carriers, whether Telecom, OTC or the other carrier, be used by the `sexploitagents' to make a fast buck. </PARA>
<PARA> The question arises: what should be done about this? Clearly, it would be in the public interest, in the interests of those large numbers of people who have petitioned this Parliament and who are concerned about this question, and indeed in the interests of Telecom and OTC, that this matter be dealt with by Austel. The rationale for placing the code of practice in the Telecommunications Bill and class licence conditions is clear. The regulation of content standards of 0055 recorded services and other entertainment services should lie with Austel and not be left to the two carriers to negotiate with service providers. </PARA>
<PARA> The two carriers should have equal responsibilities. Telecom should not have a more onerous responsibility in this particular respect than the second carrier. If only Telecom is required to have content standards, what of the second carrier? Clearly, this is a matter that should be the function of Austel, which is the regulatory body. The Telecommunications Bill gives Austel the responsibility and power to include various conditions in class licences under Part 10 of the current legislation, Division 3, and to include other conditions that it considers are necessary or desirable to achieve the objects of Part 10. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, class licences are the types of licences which would be issued to service providers to provide 0055 recorded services and other entertainment services. Placing the code of practice in legislation and under the control of Austel rather than placing it in a contract between the carriers and service providers avoids any problems or doubts as to whether the carriers could enforce such a code against the service providers. It also covers the situation as to how the new carrier, the new player in the field, should operate. Indeed, it upholds the principle of the interests of the public which, of course, this Parliament should uphold. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into the lurid details of the material that is currently, or proposed to be, sent through the telecommunications lines by particular sexploit entrepreneurs. Suffice it to say that unless we deal with this subject now whilst we can, it will be too late. We have the opportunity here and now to deal with the matter whilst we have this legislation before us. I believe it is consistent with the principles that were enunciated by the Government in 1990, and with the view generally expressed around the chamber, that whilst there should be competition, there should not be a situation where one particular carrier, namely Telecom, is placed at a significant disadvantage or advantage-whatever the case may be-in respect of a matter such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about matters of principle-a code of practice which should be observed by both carriers. I have requested that amendments be drawn so as to reflect that principle. Those amendments are currently being drawn. The first part of the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition condemns the Government's failure to allow reasonable time for consideration of the measure. To the extent that we have only received this legislation in this chamber this week, I agree with that, although I understand that an exposure draft has been around for some time. I must admit that either I did not get that exposure draft or I have not focused on it, but whichever it is, we have a problem now. Our problem is that not only my amendments, but also some other amendments, are not ready to be distributed in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, after the second reading stage, the Government will postpone consideration of this Bill to a later hour this day-or, indeed, until the next sitting week-so that detailed work can be undertaken on the amendments and they can be properly before the chamber. I ask the Government to consider postponing consideration of this Bill until the next sitting week, or have it go to the usual committee stage tomorrow. In either case, I will do my utmost to get the amendments to the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on only one aspect-albeit a very important aspect-of this package of telecommunications Bills, that is, the environmental consequences of these Bills. The background to what I wish to say I think is best summarised in a High Court of Australia decision which was given last year in relation to the powers which the Commonwealth may or may not exercise concerning environmental protection. The High Court found in the Brophy case that the many pieces of Federal legislation did not specify whether the Commonwealth was bound with respect to environmental protection. But, nonetheless, it ruled on the generality of the principle that, if the Parliament had seen fit to legislate to bind persons, including corporations, in the general community, it was reasonable to assume that the Commonwealth would also be bound by the same provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many pieces of Federal legislation which are silent on the question of whether the environmental provisions shall or shall not apply. The application of both Federal and State laws in relation to the protection of the environment has been specifically written out of this major package of legislation. In its place there is a weak and rather befuddled attempt to put in place a code of practice. That is really the crux of what I wish to speak about. </PARA>
<PARA> When this package first emerged I signalled to the electorate and, of course, to the Government and the Opposition that the Australian Democrats were very concerned about this exclusion from the applicability of State and Federal law in relation to environmental protection. Subsequently, when the package of Bills came into the House of Representatives, Mr Chaney, the shadow Minister for the environment, had a great deal to say about this. Whether he became aware of that independently or whether my earlier media comments signalled to him that this was an area of concern, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to begin by quoting extensively from what Mr Chaney had to say in the House of Representatives in relation to these exclusions because I think it is particularly important that the Opposition in the Senate, members of which have so far been remarkably silent on these important provisions, may take note of what its shadow Minister said. Amongst other things, Mr Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA>I simply wish to focus on some of the . . . environmental concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I want to use this opportunity to draw attention to the issues of principle which I think are raised . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . The Minister referred . . . to the question of powers and immunities and pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the general carriers will continue to have Telecom's existing powers in relation to land. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Telecom's total immunity from suit under the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1989, has been removed but Austel has been given the power to limit the carriers' tort liability. </PARA>
<PARA>I would say . . . that the Opposition welcomes the removal of that total immunity. I think that immunity should be given only where it is absolutely essential. There is no reason why governments or corporations should operate free from the law of the land that binds all other citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>There Mr Chaney enunciated precisely the principle which lies behind what I wish to say this morning and which lies behind some of the amendments which we wish to move. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . network related activities are exempt from State and Territory laws, and the carrier will be able to engage in those activities, despite any State or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA>There he referred specifically to environmentally damaging activities. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is on record as saying that she and the Government support the application of the toughest pollution standards. I think that in those circumstances it is appropriate that the Parliament should very carefully examine any legislation that potentially provides exemption from pollution standards which are applied to other citizens and to corporations by the laws of the States, which have the primary constitutional responsibility in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>As I will show later, we have discovered a major loophole in this legislation which would not have allowed the application of a code of practice with respect to Commonwealth law-specifically, the environmental impact proposals legislation. Mr Chaney went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister may recall that, with respect to the government instrumentalities legislation which the Government brought down some time ago but which it has since withdrawn, the Opposition objected to the proposition that there should be a general exemption from the application of State laws, with the State law being applied only if it was specifically brought back in. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Chaney was adducing a more general principle which should apply to Federal law, not just to the package with which we are dealing this morning. He further went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>When one looks at clause 116, one finds a very broad potential exemption indeed. That provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The regulations may provide that specified carriers may engage in specified exempt activities:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) despite specified laws of a State or Territory; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) despite any law of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, we have under this clause a power, by regulation, to exempt in a very broad sense, from any law at all, the corporations which will be operating under this group of Bills. That is the first issue which I would wish to raise with the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that for the benefit of the few Opposition senators who are in the chamber. Mr Chaney went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In the view of the Opposition . . . it would be desirable for the regulation making power to be structured or delineated by giving a broad generic description of the types of matters which could properly be considered as exempt activities, rather than simply having a total freedom to exempt from the operation of any law. That is not unreasonable . . . It would seem to me, at least as a starting point, that we should not have an exemption provision which is any wider than the subjects which are covered in the national code in clause 117 . . . Why is it that we have this unlimited power to exempt? Why can the Government not provide for some delineation, some classification, of the laws to which clause 116 would apply?</PARA>
<PARA> The second concern which I raise with the Government is that it is provided in clause 117 that the national code which can be put in place is to have the status of disallowable instrument. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chaney then went on to explain that, as all honourable senators would know, disallowable instruments can merely be allowed or disallowed. They do not allow for public participation in their formulation, nor do they allow for amendment. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The third point of concern that I raise with the Government is that the obligations to comply with the national code do not seem to be enforced in any serious way. There do not appear to me to be any serious provisions relating to compliance with the code, or rather to non-compliance with the code. I have not been able to find any application of monetary penalties or any provisions for judicial review for acting beyond power, any provisions for civil liability or, indeed, anything else. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the same speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that there is in existence . . . what is described as a memorandum of understanding between the Australian Telecommunications Corporation and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories concerning the application of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. This document was entered into in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>As I will show later on, we have discovered a major flaw which indicates that the application of that legislation could not be made applicable under this package of Bills. Mr Chaney went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we . . . find that most of what I might call the broad acre or external activities of the Corporation under the existing memorandum of understanding are subject to the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply untrue. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>In those circumstances, it seems unnecessary for this legislation to provide an exemption of the breadth that has been granted. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded that section of his speech by saying that:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that that memorandum of understanding represents a pretty reasonable approach to achieving a balance between the commercial requirements of the Telecommunications Corporation and the environmental concerns, which are the concerns of the Opposition . . . </PARA>
<PARA>While other bits and pieces in Mr Chaney's speech are relevant, I have established the point that Mr Chaney, at least in terms of what he said, was expressing very considerable doubts about the sense and the good environmental management practice which lies behind a package of legislation which excludes from the new telecommunications carriers the application of both Federal laws, specifically the environmental impact proposals legislation, and, in a very broad and general sense, the application of a plethora of State planning, zoning and environmental protection laws. In answer to the queries raised by Mr Chaney in his speech in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, wrote to Mr Chaney and made a number of points, some of which, as I will show, are frankly incorrect. In his letter, Mr Beazley said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>First, it is only possible for a Government to regulate in respect of ``exempt activities'' which the carriers engage in. ``Exempt activities'' are defined in clause 5.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, for the Government, while the general definition is given in clause 5, the definition of `exempt activities' is further defined and qualified in clause 116. Clause 116 effectively excludes the application of the environmental impact proposals legislation with respect to the code of practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister goes on-and this is rather disingenuous and, I believe, naughty of the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Second, as you noted in your comments, the approach in clause 116 means that there can be no exemption from State laws without regulations being made.</PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly true that the exemption is made by way of regulation, but the implication is that environmental protection is also picked up by that mechanism. That is also unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister confirms the concerns expressed by Mr Chaney and certainly shared by the Democrats that, in relation to Austel's supervision of environmental protection, Austel can do certain things, not once a breach had occurred but once a breach had occurred and the carrier had been warned to correct the breach and had subsequently failed to do so. The Minister confirms that clause 119 says:</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTEL can give the carrier a specific direction . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Not that Austel must give the carrier a specific direction when it is in breach of an environmental provision. This whole process is well beyond the reach of any public intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I again quote from the Minister's letter, which says, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure you that it is the Government's intention-</PARA>
<PARA>I think there is a word missing here-</PARA>
<PARA>will be subject to the EP(IP) Act-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act-</PARA>
<PARA>until the Code has been developed and is in place. </PARA>
<PARA>I again stress that, as we have discovered, that is simply untrue because of the way this legislation has been worded. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn from those two letters to make some general remarks about the environmental exclusion clauses of the legislation. When we first began analysing this legislation, we were quite aghast at the exemptions from the environmental laws of the Commonwealth, States and Territories that were contained in it. Some of our most significant concerns have been addressed by the Government, which has indicated its acceptance of some amendments. But other concerns about the provisions of these Bills have not drawn a satisfactory response from the Minister. More generally, we remain dismayed that some of the provisions in these Bills were included in the first place. That is the first point I would like to establish. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the High Court decision to which I referred in my opening remarks, it seems to us that the Government is embarking quite deliberately on a process of excluding the Commonwealth from responsibility under Commonwealth and State environmental protection laws and in its place is setting, presumably with respect to the operation of every department, something like a code of practice. That will become an incredibly messy and totally unsatisfactory way of doing business. I can do no better than reflect the words of Mr Chaney when he said that if the Parliament sees fit to impose provisions for environmental protection on all other persons and corporations, it should be appropriate that those provisions are also imposed on the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, we received legal advice confirming our analysis that this legislation completely excluded the Federal environment Minister and her or his Department from any role in the assessment of the environmental impact of proposed activities of telecommunications carriers by exempting the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation from the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Quite simply, that has come about because the exemptions with respect to State law are picked up by way of the code of practice. But the wording in the Bills before us fails to adequately pick up that latter piece of legislation. So under this legislation there is no way that that can be invoked. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, that major flaw was discovered in my office by Richard Bolt, to whom I pay a considerable compliment for closely analysing this legislation. It is perhaps a mark of the inevitable failure of adequately supervising legislation-when we are faced with a large number of Bills jammed up late in the session, being pushed through the Parliament and not being properly supervised-that even the legal advisers who presumably frame this legislation make these quite major errors. Having picked this up, Richard Bolt referred it to Mr Rob Fowler, a long time lecturer in environmental law in the law faculty of Adelaide University, who confirmed this defect. If it is possible for people like that to read through legislation and pick up these defects, it again makes one worry about the adequacy of supervision in relation to the framing of legislation or the care being shown by the Government with respect to environmental protection. It may indicate laxity in either or both those respects. </PARA>
<PARA> This defect would have set an extraordinary and dangerous precedent for environmental impact assessment in Australia. This is despite the fact that no-one is under any illusion that the assessment procedures under the Environmental Impact Act are inadequate; they are not. Indeed, the Democrats have been calling for them to be strengthened for years. My predecessor as the Democrats environment spokesperson, former senator Norm Sanders, tried unsuccessfully to amend the Act to strengthen the independence and transparency of the process. He later exposed the total inadequacy of the preliminary draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for the proposed development of naval facilities at Jervis Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> But for all its faults, the EIS process is all we have at this stage. It does provide the public and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism, and Territories some oversight of the development proposals. It can provide a brake on the most undesirable of those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is distressing to find that apparently Minister Kelly has quite willingly virtually written herself out of this legislation. That again does not indicate a Minister who is particularly careful with respect to properly discharging her responsibility to care for the environment. The Minister for Transport and Communications has agreed to remove the exemption from this Act, but we cannot comprehend how it got there in the first place. The Minister's office and Department did not administer the environment impact Act and they do not understand how it works. The environment Minister's office and Department does administer the Act. It is one of the most important Federal environment laws, yet Mrs Kelly apparently approved this exemption without any qualms. This is incomprehensible and a fundamental failure of the Minister's responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an appropriate time to call for a thorough overhaul of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, to ensure that the proposed environmental protection agency has a strong set of environmental impact assessment procedures to work with. In contemplating the establishment of an environmental protection agency, or authority-I am not too sure what it will be called in Australia-similar to what has been established in the United States federally and in some States of Australia, which presumably will have some general oversight in regard to the establishment of appropriate standards, it is somewhat peculiar that the Federal Government should at this time choose to write the application of Federal and State law out of this legislation and put in place a code of practice that is to be supervised by an organisation like Austel, which on the Minister's own admission will not have the legislative power, competence, or indeed the environmental expertise to judge these matters that are put under its control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Bill 1991 narrows the exemption from State or Territory laws which Telecom now enjoys. The Minister can only exempt certain activities from those laws, by regulation. The Democrats believe that no such power should be available. We believe that there should be the application of State laws to these bodies, and we can point to numerous instances where, in the recent past, Telecom with its existing exemptions has engaged in activities that are contrary to State planning, zoning and environmental protection laws. This has caused very considerable disquiet in the local communities and there has been no legislative mechanism properly to correct or to supervise those activities. The Democrats believe that no such power should be available, but we recognise that our view will not prevail. Contrary to all the nice words that the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) put down in his speech, we have been led to believe that the Opposition will not carry through with its expressed concerns and will not support us on making those State laws applicable. We believe that, at the very least, there should be no exemption from environmental, cultural heritage and Aboriginal laws, and we will move amendments to that effect during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, the Bill proposes a national code to provide a regulatory framework for those activities that are exempted from State or Territory laws. We have serious reservations about this code. We have not even seen the code, and yet we have been enjoined by the Government in bringing forward this legislation to support it, with simply a promise that the code would be put in place. If the Government was serious about environmental protection, surely it could have brought forward the code at the time when it brought in the legislation that contains these exclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the code has the potential to have stronger environmental protection provisions than the existing State and Territory legal regime, but the likely outcome is a lowest common denominator code that is weaker than it should be. There is an important point in that, that if the Federal Government is going to legislate by way of introducing a code under regulations, which is stronger, then no harm is done by leaving in place the existing and, by implication, weaker protective measures. The Constitution is quite clear that, if one piece of Federal legislation contains provisions that exceed those of the States, then the law of the Commonwealth shall prevail. Again, one finds a great logical difficulty in accepting the Government's argument that it wants to write out these provisions and then to include them by way of a code of practice-which it protests may be even stronger than what we have in place at the present time. There is an inconsistency in that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also practical difficulties. The code will rapidly become an unwieldy instrument, if it seeks to incorporate adequate environmental impact assessment procedures. The task of developing the code is going to be tortuous, and the Minister's Department has no real idea of what it will end up looking like. Again, I point to the multitude of environmental protection laws that are present in the States, and if the Government is going to proceed down this sort of road with respect to every one of its instrumentalities, exclude them and then write in codes of practice, it seems to us that it will finish up with a very messy and unwieldy set of environmental protection measures which, simply because of their complexity, will probably be full of loopholes. So it poses a great danger for the Commonwealth to go down that road. It would be far better to substantially strengthen the legislation that is already in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats accept that, unfortunately, the code will become a reality, so we will move amendments to give the public a role in its development and enforcement. I simply put on the record here that we have gained the support of both the Government and the Opposition in relation to our proposal for a public inquiry once the draft code has been released. We welcome that provision because it is absolutely appropriate in an area in which the technology is rapidly changing, and many of the potential environmental impacts of this technology cannot even be foreseen, looking only a few years into the future. The widest public consultation must occur and that consultation must have a very significant impact on the drafting of the code of practice. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Democrats have very serious concerns about the general direction in which the Government is going, as evidenced by this legislation: excluding Government instrumentalities from the application of existing environmental protection law and relying instead on a code of practice. We believe, as the honourable member for Pearce himself has said, that, where the Commonwealth has legislated for environmental protection and imposed those conditions on other persons, on other corporations, it should seek to observe those same conditions itself. If it seeks stronger provisions, such provisions should apply uniformly to everybody and not exclusively to one person or corporation. This may be the first of many Bills of this ilk, although we hope that that is not the case. However, if it is, we will be expressing reservations in respect of any other such Bills that appear before the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the Telecommunications Bill 1991 and allied Bills, which constitute a major package of reform from the Labor Government. I have been involved in these proposals as a member of the Caucus telecommunications working group and as a member of the ministerial advisory committee, established by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), to advise him and members of the industry about the drafting of the legislation. I want to put on record here my appreciation, as a member of both those committees, of the work of the people who worked on those committees, and particularly the experts who provided us with information, whether from the Department or from the various industry bodies. The ministerial advisory committee had representatives from the full range of the telecommunications industry in Australia and overwhelming unanimity was reached on most of the fundamental issues contained in these Bills. Many of the suggestions that they made were taken up by the Minister and the Government. Having regard to such monumental legislation which is detailed and technical, I think these Bills are as good as we will get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not doubt that at some time in the near future someone will find an odd clause here or there where there has been an error in drafting and so on. But, in view of the content and nature of these Bills, those hiccups will be small and will not deflect from the major changes that the Government has put to the Parliament with these Bills. Before I deal with a couple of specific things, I wish to comment upon the justification that the Government has made for these changes. </PARA>
<PARA> On my part, I have been interested in telecommunications for a long time. In the Whitlam Government I was Principal Private Secretary to the last Postmaster-General in Australia, Senator Bishop, when he put the Bill through parliament to break up the old Postmaster-General's Department into what is now the two corporations. At that stage that was a major change. That change lasted some 16 years until we have before us today these changes. So I have had a genuine interest all of that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the changes in allowing competition in the model before us, which is a duopoly model, is the best for the nature of Australia. I do not support open slather competition because I believe that in an economy the size of Australia-a country with a dispersed population in a continent almost as big as continental America and with only 17 million people compared with 250 million people-one has to adjust one's model of telecommunications to meet the circumstances of Australia. It is absolutely no use comparing ourselves with the model that either the Americans, the Canadians, the British or any other country have adopted because none of them have the peculiar geography and population descriptions that we have. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals before us will mean that we will get the best balance by providing a community service with competition and thereby guaranteeing that all citizens of Australia have access to telecommunications services, which I think is a social right in a modern society. This model also provides for competition, which means that the consumers get some opportunity to make judgments about the sort of service they want under the prices they want. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing must be made quite clear: there is no system of telecommunications in the world that is totally and utterly deregulated. No-one proposes that anywhere in the world. It is a unique industry. There has to be a bottom line where the Government says, `These are the rules and the parameters in which this industry will have to work, otherwise sections of the community will miss out'. That is the model that we will have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe anybody, except possibly a very small fringe on the far right of our community, would argue against the need for government monitoring, government regulation, to protect the public interest. This model that the Government has put forward is the best to give ourselves an opportunity to have a telecommunications industry which not only provides the best possible system for Australia but also gives ourselves an opportunity to sell our technical expertise, whether it be in the hardware or software area, or in the services area, to the region of the world where telecommunications has got the biggest growth rate; that is, the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> One expert said, in one of the briefings I had, that between the time when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and the present time some 450 million telephones have been connected in the world. It is estimated that in the next 15 years in the Asia-Pacific region a further 400 million telephones will be connected as those economies grow, with consumers and households wanting to have a telecommunications service. In 15 years we will get a doubling of the number of telephone connections in the world, which has already taken over a century to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> We are best placed as a modern economy to get part of that action, so to speak. I believe that the model before us gives us that opportunity in two ways. Firstly, the merger of the Australian Communications Corporation (Telecom) and OTC Ltd provides us with a public enterprise that is big enough to go out and sell its services and its expertise. Secondly, we have a privately owned competitor and carrier which will also be developing a system and using its expertise in Australia to go out and sell its services to the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of that process of providing the competitive model we will also be able to encourage Australian industry in the manufacturing area and particularly in software and in those service areas which are called intellectual properties and so on, where it is the brain power of people that one sells not the actual hardware. That is where the big profit will be in telecommunications in the future. We will be well placed to develop those subsidiary industries in our own telecommunications industry and to get that benefit and, as I say, to go into that region. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the unfortunate aspects of the present system has been that much of the private sector has said, `Telecommunications is left to Telecom. There is nothing for us in it. Telecom has got a monopoly. We are not interested'. By having this competitive model, private enterprise will see that there is an opportunity to become involved in Australia and see opportunities for investment. When one gets further players in the field providing the value-added services, et cetera, that to me means that we can build a base for further export services. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment on the remarks made particularly by the Australian Democrats. Senator Kernot, the spokesman for the Democrats on telecommunications, has said there are two areas of these Bills that it has trouble with. One is about the wide level of ministerial discretion given in the Bills to the Minister. I understand the debate in this place at any time about the argument of powers between the Minister, or the Executive, and the powers of the Parliament. The point about what is the best range of balance is always arguable. I am not going to be dogmatic and say that in these Bills we have got it absolutely correct. If the Democrats have legitimate areas to raise where it believes that some of these discretions should be turned from ministerial into parliamentary, then they ought to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say to the Democrats: for goodness sake, do not tie down a system in which there is no continuity in regulation and in setting the guidelines where they could always be overturned in parliament because that would be counterproductive to the development of an expanding but stable telecommunications industry. But I take the Democrats' point because in any major legislation it is legitimate for the Parliament to say, `These regulations or these ministerial discretions ought to be under supervision of the Parliament'. But let us make sure that we get the balance right between either side of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that Senator Kernot raised was the question of the merger of OTC and Telecom and the merger fee. I want to say to the Democrats in particular: do not fall for the line that the Opposition is putting, that it is opposing the merger fee because it thinks that it is some sort of financial rort. The Opposition wants the Democrats to vote against the merger fee and/or the merger itself, because if the merger fails it will be so much easier for the Opposition-if it wins the next election or any subsequent election-to privatise Telecom and OTC separately. Mr Smith, the spokesman for the Liberal Party of Australia in the lower House, has made it quite clear why it opposes the merger fee. The Opposition wants to leave Telecom much better cashed up, to use his words, so that it can be more easily sold off at a higher price. We really have what the Liberal Party is about in opposing the merger and the merger fee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to leave as much money in the pot so that it can flog off Telecom at a higher price, in my view, to cover its other promises which are to change the Income Tax Act and to remove the capital gains tax so that the losses in revenue in those areas will be recouped by having a `cashed up', as the Opposition calls it, Telecom to sell off at a higher price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has interjected that we want to starve it of funds. I think that nothing is further from the truth. I want to say that, when we put this proposal forward to merge Telecom and OTC, we are creating an organisation that next year is anticipated to have revenue of about $11 billion, assets of around $20 billion and growth rates in the demand for services and income going up at 10 per cent, 12 per cent or maybe 8 per cent of those of the not so active economies of other countries. Everyone suggests that, by the end of the decade, the merged OTC and Telecom will have revenues of about $25 billion because of the demand for telecommunications services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the Democrats-if they are in support of private enterprise-that, in merging these two organisations, we will have the biggest public enterprise in the Southern Hemisphere, and it will be the major player in the biggest industry in Australia at the turn of the century. In the year 2000, 25 per cent to 30 per cent of gross domestic product in Australia will be in telecommunications services and information distribution, dominated by a public enterprise-and people say that we are selling out and giving it all to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest-this may be a point that the Opposition disagrees with-that, by the year 2000, a competitor would be lucky to have, at the most, 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the telecommunications services market. Those are the figures of the potential competitors. They do not expect to take over three-quarters of Telecom's business, but they want to get into areas that will be profitable to them. In effect, they accept the fact that Telecom, merged with OTC, will be the dominant player and will set the standard for Australian telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats seem to be concerned about the financial structure. There are arguments about this, and I do not disagree. My friends in Telecom have been knocking on my door for two or three years complaining that they should have more access to public borrowings, and more access to Loan Council moneys. I point out that the recent decision by the Australian Government has meant that, for this coming financial year, Telecom has basically got what it wanted. It will have loan money available, through the Loan Council, of over $600m. It has got all that it basically sought and that, plus its own internally generated profit which will be able to be reinvested, will give it an investment program of several billion dollars to continue to expand the network to meet the demands of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that a further argument is being put-I am sympathetic to it-that the new merged carrier, government owned, should be removed from the restrictions of the public sector borrowing requirements. It should have more flexibility to borrow money to meet the commercial demands so that it can compete. I am sympathetic to that view. In what has just been decided, it has got what it wanted from the Australian Government. The Government has understood the requirement that, in the new environment that is coming for the new merged carrier, it must have access to adequate funds otherwise it may not be able to compete. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Spindler and to the Democrats who are here that what we are proposing for Telecom is not to starve it. None of us in the Government want it to starve. We do want it to grow, and it will grow. There are enormous opportunities for it to grow. There are a number of internal reforms that will have to be carried out in the management of Telecom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They both are public enterprises, owned by the Australian people through the Australian Government. The argument I have is that, over the past 100 years, the Australian public has invested billions of dollars of public money in the establishment of the telecommunications system in this country. But there are other areas of public sector investment that have received nowhere near the amount of money that the telecommunications system has received to establish itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not decry Telecom getting one cent of the money that it has received. I am interested in the idea that there are other areas of the public sector that have been starved. For example, the national rail system has not got anywhere near the contribution of public sector money that Telecom has received. I do not think it is unreasonable for those people who demand a decent rail system in this country to say, `Well, shouldn't there be some return to the public sector of all the money we have had invested in telecommunications? You are in an industry that even if you are blind drunk and blindfolded, you can make a lot of money out of it because it is a growth area. Yet if for social and economic reasons we need to rebuild a decent rail system, we are going to need at least $1 billion'.

The No. 1 priority that we are all agreed on is rail because this country needs a decent rail system.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is a fundamental point in this debate that has to be dealt with. I respect the Democrats for raising the issue in the way in which they have because it is a point that has to be carried through. I say to the Democrats that there are many of us in the Government, certainly a majority, who do not believe that any merger fee or any money got from the sale of any of those assets, whether it is Australian Airlines Ltd, the minority shareholding in Qantas Airways Ltd, Aussat Pty Ltd, or whatever, should just be lost in Treasury as a way of reducing a deficit or boosting a surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The commitment by the Government has been that that money should go into reinvesting in Australia's infrastructure. Senator Spindler can ask, `Why don't you get money from somewhere else?'. That would mean that we either raise taxes or we run a bigger deficit. If the Democrats want to raise those issues and tell the Australian people that they will have to pay increased taxation, they can do so. But Senator Spindler knows the argument he will get.</PARA>
<PARA> Above all else, I say to the Democrats: do not fall for the old three-card trick that the Opposition is putting-namely, stop the merger because Telecom should not pay the merger fee.

We want it to be a strong, prosperous, commercially oriented enterprise that provides service to the Australian people and returns a profit to the Australian people. I do not think it is unreasonable, therefore, to say to Telecom or to the new entity, `Because you are merging we have increased your profitability, and because OTC is in a strong financial position it is not unreasonable for the Government to ask for a modest merger fee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take up the time of the Senate for too long because there will, no doubt, be an extended debate during the committee stage when all of these matters will be covered. Senator Coulter has left, but I dare say that he will hear about what I have to say. I want to cover two matters. Firstly, I thought the contributions by members of the Opposition on the question of a regulator were extraordinary, considering the divergence of views that they expressed during the debate yesterday. They do not seem to have a policy on that. Secondly, I want to address some fundamentally inaccurate matters that were put to the Senate by Senator Coulter, who seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of the current immunity which Telecom enjoys from compliance with environmental and planning laws and what precisely the Government is proposing to do about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the subject of regulatory models, we have an extraordinary divergence of views on the Opposition benches, with contributions made yesterday by Senator Panizza, Senator Bishop and Senator Alston, who is the shadow Minister. Senator Alston exhorted us to make our independent regulator, Austel, the same as Oftel, the British model. But later in the same debate a trenchant position was taken by Senator Bishop-who only ever takes trenchant positions-who said that we did not need an independent regulator at all. Perhaps Senator Bishop and Senator Alston need to get together fairly urgently prior to the committee debate to work out what the Opposition policy on this fundamentally important question is. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop said specifically that we should follow the New Zealand model, which has no regulator. I would like to know some time during the committee stage of the debate whether the Liberal Party does have a policy on this vitally important question. It does not appear to have one. Senator Panizza had his own views on the question of whether or not we need a regulator. He agreed with Senator Bishop when he said that we did not because Britain-where they have Oftel, a model which Senator Alston wants us to adopt-has the highest local telephone call charges in the world and we have the second highest charges. I do not want to delay the Senate unduly by talking about the holes in that argument because the comparisons are flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> Many others countries in the world-the United States is a classic example-have widely diverging regimes of local call charges that differ from network to network and, indeed, from city to city. The fact is that in Australia we have untimed local calls on which there is no restriction and a flat charge applied, and when we compare that with other systems in the world which have timed telephone calls we very rapidly reach a position of having one of the lowest charging regimes for local calls in the world. I am sorry to have to tell Senator Panizza that that is a fact. </PARA>

It is a very difficult comparison and not nearly as clear-cut as Senator Panizza might like to have it. But the one thing he did make a clear-cut statement about was that we do not need a body like Oftel, and that Senator Bishop was right-we do not need a regulator; we want to get into this pure market. As Senator Schacht pointed out quite correctly, there are a few fundamental structural flaws to that nice, clean argument applying in Australia. We need an Australian solution, as I have said in respect of the shipping and aviation industry. The same things apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a test for it that honourable senators can look to. We have deregulated the aviation industry, and what I predicted-and one did not need be a Rhodes scholar to work it out-has turned out to be the case. The natural structure of the Australian aviation market, tiny by international comparisons with widely dispersed, low population centres, a relatively low level of traffic by international standards and an enormous country to cover, has determined that, in the seven months since deregulation started-and there is no bar on how many people may enter that market-we have only one new entrant, which is exactly what everyone thought we would get, that is, Compass Airlines Pty Ltd. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not. Senator Kernot lives in a dream world. I thought when she made this comment yesterday that she must be one of the most infrequent fliers in the country. She is ignoring the most fundamental flaw in that argument. It is a silly argument because parallel scheduling-that is, cluster scheduling-is determined in a deregulated market in the same way in which it was determined in a regulated market, namely, by the marketplace. Senator Kernot is fundamentally wrong. A myth existed-I do not want to go too far down this track-that under the two airlines agreement we had this business of parallel schedules which were determined by the two airlines agreement. It was a nonsense, and has been for 20 years, in the sense that, prior to our deregulating the market, Australian Airlines Ltd serviced only 25 per cent of the ports that it was serving 20 years ago, and had itself tried by commercial competition with Ansett Airlines of Australia to deregulate its schedules. The market responded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The commercial realities of timetables are very important. The reason that the airlines construct the timetables they do is that the market responds to them very quickly. They schedule their flights at the time when the majority of the market wants to fly. That happened in a regulated market under the two airlines agreement and it is continuing to happen under the new deregulated market that we now have in Australia. Senator Kernot should come and live in the real world rather than the unreal world in which she lives. The facts are that, when airlines change schedules, there is a response from the marketplace. </PARA>

No doubt the market will change over time as the population builds up and the market improves.

I conclude by saying-and I could go for hours about it-that Senator Kernot should look at the new airline schedules between Canberra and Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What! There are 16 Ansett shuttle flights a day that were not there before deregulation and are there now just on that one route. As for Telecom, we have to create the kind of climate in the marketplace that will assist competition rather than simply do as the Opposition does, which is to utter the word `competition' and expect it simply to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bishop would do very well to talk to people in industry and business and the users of these systems who are saying that Austel is playing an essential role at present. Its role will become even more important in ensuring that real network competition can get started on a fair and equitable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The competitive safeguards which the Government is proposing to implement under Austel are recognised around the world as being the most innovative, comprehensive and pro-competitive there are. In New Zealand, the Government decided to allow network competition some three or four years ago, but competition has not got started yet. I would ask Senator Panizza to have a look at the position. The putative competitor in New Zealand has not yet got one per cent of the market. Why is that the case? Because the New Zealand Commerce Commission simply does not have the power adequately to address the system of the power of the market itself, and in this world, where there are not level playing fields, the power of the incumbent monopolist which is already in place providing the service. </PARA>
<PARA> Competition does not just happen because one says that one believes in competition, even though those opposite cannot work out a common position among themselves. One has to create the conditions to allow it to happen and to happen on a fair and efficient basis. That is what this package of Bills does, I think more effectively than any other system that is currently in place in the world. I say again that that is the general view in the industry internationally. It is felt that this is a comprehensively better way to proceed than most of the efforts that have been attempted elsewhere. I will be interested to see whose views prevail this afternoon in the committee stage-Senator Bishop's and Senator Panizza's view or Senator Alston's view on the question of a regulator. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now address what Senator Coulter said in debate. I had some difficulty understanding whether Senator Coulter was simply assuming that we were changing an existing situation in removing from Telecom some obligation that it had to comply with State environmental and planning laws. It has never been obliged to, it has always been exempted, and we are imposing on Telecom, for the first time in its existence, a necessity to comply with a set of environmental laws at State and Federal level as well. It has always been obliged to comply with the Commonwealth processes, but that involves only a tiny part of its total operations, which are fundamentally affected to a far greater degree by State and local laws which Telecom has never before been obliged to comply with. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we have now established, even though the quantum may be argued, that this Government has set the protection of the environment as a prime objective of its policy making. The Government proposes that a national planning code will be developed to provide a predictable and national approach to the development of telecommunications infrastructure-for the first time. It will maximise protection of the environment and set in place appropriate design standards and planning procedures. It will cover the majority of the facilities which currently are exempted from the application of State laws. </PARA>
<PARA> The code will impose more comprehensive obligations and restrictions on both carriers than those that apply currently to either Telecom or OTC. This represents a considerable winding back of Telecom's current exemption from all State, Territory or local government law. For the first time, telecommunications facilities will be subject to external environmental regulation and accountability. The result will be uniform processes which will also enable the second carrier to roll out its network in the shortest possible time-in other words, to provide some real competition quickly. The carriers will be required to consult fully in advance with State and local governments regarding the development of telecommunications facilities. To suggest, as Senator Coulter has, that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has been written out of this Act is untrue. The Minister for the Environment will play a decisive role with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) in drawing up the national code with which the carriers will have to comply. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, I must take exception to the suggestion that Senator Coulter has in some way discovered a flaw in the Government's approach to ensuring that both carriers comply with the highest environmental protection standards. I have already pointed out that this code represents a fundamental reversal of the wide-ranging powers and immunities that Telecom currently enjoys, and has always enjoyed in the past-a blanket exemption from State and local environmental and planning laws. We are fixing that. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why the Government decided to adopt an industry specific code is clear. We are now to have a competitor to Telecom which has the task of building an alternative network to Telecom. Telecom built its network, which now reaches 96 per cent of Australian homes, while it had almost total immunity from environmental law. If the second carrier were to compete with Telecom on the level playing field that we hear so much about, logic might have dictated that we give it the same immunities as Telecom has enjoyed in the past and, indeed, currently enjoys. Obviously, the Government did not do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, the Government sensibly decided to adopt a national code, specific to this industry, which would ensure that both carriers would be subject to the same planning laws on a uniform basis throughout Australia. It is totally mischievous to say that this Government has been negligent of environmental concerns. On the contrary, this code represents the imposition, for the first time, of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to environmental compliance by the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I know that these matters will be canvassed more comprehensively during the committee stage of the debate and I thank all honourable senators for their support. </PARA>

<PARA> In view of the substantial number of bills which have to be considered by the Senate during the last sitting week, the committee has reviewed its previous recommendations that the Copyright Amendment Bill 1990 and the Fisheries Administration Bill 1990 be referred to committees after the bills are read a second time. The committee understands it would assist with the programming of government business if the committees could begin their scrutiny and analysis of the legislation immediately, that is, before the bills are read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Accordingly, the committee recommends that the Copyright Amendment Bill 1990 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Fisheries Administration Bill 1990 be referred to the Industry, Science and Technology Committee before the bills are read a second time. Both committees to present their reports by 18 June 1991. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 1991 and Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill 1991 which we are now debating cognately are important Bills. The Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, in particular, is important and it is to that Bill that I will be directing my comments in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 is to make various changes to the petroleum resource rent tax, or PRRT, and to excise and royalties laws. It will extend PRRT from 1 July 1990-in other words, it is retrospective legislation-to petroleum recovered from Bass Strait. It also has provisions to provide for the interim collection arrangements in relation to Bass Strait petroleum production. It has welcome provisions to provide wider deductibility of exploration expenditure and it also changes the compounding rate for carried forward undeducted expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> It will have a negative financial impact, according to the Government, over the next two years of $755m. The cost to revenue in 1990-91 is estimated at $305m and in 1991-92 at $450m. According to the Government, a positive revenue outcome is expected in 1992-93. The measure was announced in the 1990-91 Budget and it is, therefore, being treated by the Government and, of course, by the coalition as a Budget Bill. Therefore, we will not be opposing the Bill although we do have some considerable concerns about which I and my colleagues-particularly Senator Kemp and Senator Watson who have been members of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration which considered this Bill last week-will be having further things to say. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting, and significant, to see the disagreement between the producers-Esso-BHP-and the Government in the committee hearing last week concerning just what the financial impact was. The Government undertook to provide a reconciliation between the $750m stated as the financial impact in the explanatory memorandum and the considerably lower figure that was being quoted by the gas producers and, I think, some of the gas users. To my knowledge, that reconciliation has not been provided and I hope that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) will be able to provide that information in the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The main part of the Bill relates to the application, for the first time, of resource rent tax to Bass Strait oil and gas production. So far as Bass Strait oil is concerned, there is general agreement on all sides, I think, that the application of RRT will be beneficial. It is said-and there is no reason to doubt this-that it will unlock 200 million to 300 million barrels of oil which, because of the existing excise and royalty regime, it is not economic to produce now. So it will be beneficial because the oil will be unlocked. As well as that-and this applies to more than Bass Strait-the decision to extend tax deductibility of exploration and expenditure to a company-wide basis, rather than on a project basis, for the purpose of RRT will also be beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that, however, in this Bill the Government is reducing the carry forward rate for general expenditures incurred from 1 July 1990 from the previous long term bond rate plus 15 per cent to the long term bond rate plus 5 per cent. Undeducted exploration expenditure will continue to be eligible for compounding at the bond rate plus 15 per cent for the first five years, but down to the gross domestic product deflator thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some concern on our part about both of those proposals and that concern was reflected by witnesses who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, particularly by the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA), in relation to the reduction from the long term bond plus 15 per cent down to 5 per cent. The spokesman for the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association said that APEA:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . believes the change to the general project expenditure uplift from the long term bond rate-a reduction from the long term bond rate plus 15 to the long term bond rate plus 5 on the general project; which are the development costs-does not adequately take care of the development risks associated with petroleum development and production. </PARA>
<PARA>That appears on page 127 of the Committee Hansard of 31 May 1991. So a concern was expressed there. There is also some concern that the Bill provides that the five-year rule start from the date of issue of a production licence rather than from the date of application. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern of the industry and the Opposition relates to the possibility of there being a significant time gap between the date of application and the date of issue. In the Committee last week, the Department of Shipping and Aviation Support and the Minister assured us that that would not occur. An Opposition amendment to make sure that that did not occur-in other words, an Opposition amendment to relate the starting date to the date of application rather than the date of issue-was lost in committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Australian Democrats will not be supporting that amendment today, so we will not be progressing with that. But that is on the firm understanding that Senator McMullan gave us earlier in the week that he will make a statement in the course of his summary on the second reading debate that the Government will take steps to ensure that the slippage that is of concern to the producers does not in fact happen at the bureaucratic level.</PARA>
<PARA> It is to the effect of this Bill on Bass Strait gas that I wish to devote the remainder of my remarks. The decision to apply resource rent tax to Bass Strait production was announced by the former Treasurer in the Budget Speech last year. It is quite clear from his remarks in the Budget speech that he had in mind Bass Strait oil, because he said that the decision was being taken in the following context:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as recent events in the Middle East have emphasised, Australia's oil reserves are a scarce resource that must be carefully husbanded in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The remainder of his very brief comments announcing the decision were all in that context. There was no intimation at all in what the Treasurer said last year in the Budget Speech that the situation of Bass Strait gas had specifically been taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, it is my view and the coalition's view that the Budget decision just forgot about Bass Strait gas. The decision was specifically oriented towards oil, and gas has got caught up in that process. That means, of course, that there is now a major differentiation in the tax treatment of the two major offshore gas projects in Australia, namely, Bass Strait and North West Shelf, because North West Shelf is not subject to the resource rent tax regime. Whilst explanations were given to justify the differentiation in the Committee hearing last week, I did not find them by any means an adequate explanation of the differentiation that has now occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter of great concern to the coalition is that there was virtually no consultation at all between the Federal Government and the gas users in Victoria before this Budget decision was taken last year. All of the Victorian users of gas, in the sense of being customers of Esso-BHP, appeared before the Committee last week. All of them were unanimous that there had been no consultation at all with them on this matter before the Budget decision was taken. There had been some consultation, apparently, with the Victorian Government, which is to be condemned for not having taken the issue to the producers or, more particularly, to the users, to see what they thought about it and what the impact was. To the extent that there is a negative impact in Victoria of this Bill-and that is a matter for further debate-the Kirner Government stands full square with the responsibility for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact on gas users in Victoria could be very significant. It all depends on the extent to which the Bass Strait producers, namely, Esso-BHP, attempt to pass on the RRT to their customers. If they do, the increase in the price of gas to both industrial and domestic users in Victoria will be very significant indeed. The increase will range between 20 per cent to 30 per cent. There are various estimates of the impact but, if there is full pass on, the impact will be very considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> That is in marked contrast to the assurance that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) gave a couple of months ago-on 9 April-at the APEA annual conference in Melbourne when he assured Victorian consumers that they would not be paying any more for natural gas in spite of RRT. That view was obviously not fully shared by his counterpart in the Victorian Parliament, David White. It was only after the Federal Government had announced a compensation package of $60m to Victoria to ease the transitional price impact of the RRT that Victorian Minister David White said that he then did not think there would be much impact on prices. In turn, that conflicts with the views that the former Federal Treasurer expressed when he was introducing this legislation in the House a couple of weeks ago. It is another example of the inability of the Government to get its act together internally. In terms of relationships between the Federal Government and the Victorian Government, it is another example of divisions and incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> If this impact eventuates, it will do so at a time when industry in Victoria is being battered by the recession that was engineered by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the discredited former Treasurer, Mr Keating, and by the criminally incompetent Cain and Kirner governments in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA> The impact on industry could be very widespread. It would include the Victorian producers of bricks, cement and paper. On behalf of a wide range of other users, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures made representations pointing out quite clearly the detrimental impact that a full pass-on of the tax would have on them. Very importantly, because there is a difference, the petrochemical industry, which is basically centred in Victoria, also made representations, because its feed stock is ethane. The ethane also comes from Bass Strait, so the petrochemical industry stands to be hit both ways-by an increase in the price of its fuel, namely, gas, and, more importantly, by the impact on its feed stock, ethane. Those industries are in deep international competition and have no ability to take account of any prices passed on to them as a result of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Federal Government is now attempting to alleviate the potential damage by giving Victoria a special grant of $30m for each of the two years 1990-91 and 1991-92 to offset the impact of the RRT on industry. As Senator McMullan said in the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration last week, that $60m package will, according to the Commonwealth Government, only go to alleviate something like one half of the possible price impact. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very significant and very important to record that the Federal Government expects the Victorian Government to assist with absorbing any pass-on of the resource rent tax that the Bass Strait producers may attempt. We would certainly agree with the proposition that the Victorian Government bears an important responsibility to do that, particularly as it has been absolutely ripping off revenue from the Bass Strait producers through the public account contribution, which has escalated remarkably in recent years from something like $90m to well over $300m in the space of the last eight years alone. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope and expect that the producers will also be a party to absorbing the resource rent tax. Theoretically, RRT should be borne fully by the producers. RRT is not a tax which should be passed on to users. Therefore, we would certainly expect the producers-namely, Esso and BHP-to absorb a significant part of the tax. But it needs to be shared between the Victorian Government, the producers and the Federal Government, which is now making the $60m grant, in such a way that the price impact will be minimal on end users. </PARA>
<PARA> Consideration was given by the coalition as to whether the Bill should include a clause prohibiting the pass-on from the producers. We considered it very carefully. There are some important problems with such a proposition. First of all, it would completely absolve the Victorian Government from any responsibility to absorb; I think that would be wrong. It would also be a massive interference by government in the operations of the marketplace. Therefore, I believe that it would have potential for considerable damage in the longer term. It would also run the risk of setting a dangerous precedent in taxation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> However, having said that, I also emphasise that the coalition fully shares the very real concerns of the Victorian customers of Esso-BHP about the possible pass-on to them of the RRT. My colleagues Senator Kemp and Senator Watson will elaborate on this point in their remarks because it is very important. I will not take up any further time of the Senate on that point. As I say, these concerns were expressed in detail and at length by Senator Kemp, Senator Watson and me during the consideration of the Bill in the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. We will be coming back to that again. We would urge the producers and the Victorian Government to ensure that any pass-on is minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly because of those concerns that the coalition will be moving two amendments to the Bill before the Senate. One of those amendments also reflects our additional concern that, to date, neither the Federal Government nor the Victorian Government has given any guarantee that the $60m grant by the Commonwealth to Victoria will be used for the purposes for which it is intended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Because the grant appears completely untied at this stage-there is no mention of it in the Bill-we are very concerned that it could be completely swallowed up in the voracious financial jaws of the incompetent Victorian Government. The first amendment will make it clear in the Act that the $60m must be used for the purpose for which it is intended, namely, to minimise the transitional pressure on gas prices on an equitable basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our second amendment reflects our concern and the concern of the Victorian gas users about the possible impact of the application of the resource rent tax to Bass Strait gas. This is an amendment that the Government will be supporting. I am very disappointed that the Government is not proposing to support, and did not support in the legislation committee, the previous amendment to which I have just referred. It appears the Government and the Democrats share the coalition's view that it would be quite remiss of this Parliament to wash its hands of this Bill once it is enacted, given the concern of all sides about the possible impact of the implication of RRT to Bass Strait gas. The impact is uncertain; we do not know what it will be. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary for the Federal Parliament to follow up on what actually happens as a result of the operation of the Act and its application to Bass Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, the coalition moved the amendment in the legislation committee requiring the Government to report to the Parliament by 30 November 1992, five months after the end of the two years after the effective starting date of the application of RRT to Bass Strait. The Government has accepted this amendment and the Democrats have expressed their support for it too. The amendment requires the Government to report to the Parliament on the operation of the Act. That report is to include, firstly, whether the Act has been effective in achieving its objectives; secondly, the impact on prices and on industry-the point that has been of such great concern to us all on this side of the chamber-and, thirdly, the impact on the development of new offshore petroleum projects as a result of the changes that have been made. I am pleased that that amendment will be fully supported and that the coalition has moved it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks to the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. Before considering the proposals put forward in the Bill, it may be appropriate to consider the existing situation and to advert to some historical matters that are important, in order to put this Bill into context. In 1987 this Parliament passed a package of Bills which levied a special tax, known as the petroleum resource rent tax, on the economic rent which is earned by producers of petroleum products that are extracted from offshore areas outside the territorial seas. Two areas were excluded from the tax base in 1987, namely, the North West Shelf and Bass Strait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate today extends the application of the resource rent tax of 40 per cent to Bass Strait. The tax applies only to economic rent, that is, only that return which is in excess of the return necessary for the investment to proceed will be taxable. Clearly, the minimum level of acceptable return is a difficult figure to calculate; however, it is clearly above the zero risk return that is available from government guaranteed securities. The legislation recognises that and adds an indexation factor for exploration and development expenditure in addition to the bond rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The crucial factor in the design of the tax is that economic rent, known in the legislation as `taxable profit', is taxable on a project specific basis; that is, liability arises and continues in respect of a particular production licence area, irrespective of any other activity undertaken by the producer-and here I am still referring to the 1987 legislation. This means that, once the exploration and development costs have been recouped by the producer, the community enjoys a large slice of the additional super profits which accrue to the producer. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only with the support of the Australian Democrats that the legislation passed in 1987, and that was contingent on the adequate funding of research into alternative renewable energy supplies. The Government at the time issued a statement promising that $5m would be placed into an account, to be committed and spent over five years for renewable energy, energy conservation and efficiency research. As a result of that, the Renewable Energy Research Trust Account, the so-called Sunshine Fund, was then duly set up. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, most of the promised $5m has since been disbursed or committed. The Minister's words suggested, though, that the total funding for renewable research and development would increase as a result of the new fund. This was indeed an important point, because even then some general funding was already available for renewable energy through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council. That council was then to be made responsible for managing the Sunshine Fund as well. Our then resources and energy spokesperson, Senator Norm Sanders, was told by ministerial and departmental staff that the Sunshine Fund would indeed provide additional funding. That commitment has not been met, and in fact solar energy researcher, Professor Stephen Kaneff, has shown that, after a one-off jump in renewable energy research and development funds in 1988-89, funding in 1989-90 was the lowest in real terms in the period after 1978 and that the 1990-91 level was the third lowest and only marginally more than in 1989-90. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During this debate on matters of public interest I wish to outline the problems that have evolved from the implementation of the Disability Services Act, particularly those relating to the closing down of sheltered employment services in Victoria. During the debate on the Disability Services Act, then Minister Grimes claimed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This legislation tries to provide the capacity for people to change and be innovative and the capacity for government to respond to people's ideas rather than people having to follow rigid government guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know that there was appropriate reason for looking at disability services because some of them had been paternalistic or maternalistic. There was need for change; and the industry agreed that there was need for change. However, the changes are not working. They are not working to the satisfaction of the sector nor of the people that the sector is there to provide for-the people with whom they are working; the people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I will show today, the Disability Services Act has failed to meet the objective as outlined by former Senator Grimes in the area of providing employment services for people with disabilities. The Act provides for a five-year transitional funding arrangement ending in July 1992 at which time all sheltered workshops will be replaced by competitive employment training and placement services and supported employment services. </PARA>
<PARA> In layman's terms, this means that the larger multipurpose workshops with which many of us are familiar will be replaced by smaller, more concentrated units whose primary task will be to prepare disabled people for employment in the general community. The transition would be facilitated by Commonwealth recurrent and capital funding as well as assistance from departmental project officers. The aim of the program is to provide an accountable and more effective avenue through which people with disabilities can access mainstream employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the disability services sector generally agrees to the principles and objectives of the Act, this transition phase continues to be fraught with problems. The people caught between the stools are the people with disabilities. The June 1992 deadline will not be met. In the April Estimates, the Department recognised that the transitional phase would extend beyond 1992 and claimed that any workshops which have made the commitment to move towards open employment would not be closed down. Despite this admission, there has been no official extension. The coalition has recognised this problem and proposed an extension until 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Many services are finding that the mobile work crews, the disabled enclaves and the small business projects outlined in the Act are simply unworkable. Many projects simply are not viable in this, ex-Treasurer Keating's, recession. The jobs simply are not there, set-up costs can be prohibitive, and sufficient Commonwealth funding is not available. In the April Estimates, the Department admitted that there are not enough funds to meet the present demand. The persistent complaints from the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled about the costs involved in setting up these programs continue to fall on deaf ears in the Government. New services do not sufficiently cater for people who are not capable of accessing mainstream employment but who, quite rightly, do not want to remain at home day after day. In many cases their lives have revolved around the sheltered workshop for up to 20 years or even more. While this intransigent Act forces these larger factory-style centres to close down, there remains a continued, pent-up demand for services. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have moved around Victoria and visited a number of these workshops many service providers have expressed to me their concern about the never-ending array of reports, discussion papers, conferences and briefings that they have had to undertake during this transition phase. I guess everyone is getting a dose of government interference under the philosophy of a Labor government. What we get is poking around, a never-ending array of reports, discussion papers, conferences, et cetera. Both the shadow Minister and I have received a range of complaints about heavy-handed departmental project officers who do not see eye to eye with service providers. There is widespread concern that a number of those departmental officers have no direct hands-on experience in the provision of services to disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that many of these administrative problems stem from the lack of genuine consultation prior to the drafting of the Disability Services Act. This has resulted in an inflexible Act and confusion both within the Department and amongst service providers. A classic example that I have been informed about is a Victorian service which has set up a viable business venture-in fact, one I visited-but it is risking its funding because the number of participants exceeds the magical number set down in the Act. Here we have a centre in a rural area that is at a point where it is now almost financially viable. It manufactures clothes horses and other products and has a large order to fill. The centre is now one of the major suppliers of clothes horses in Victoria-if not Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of innovative industries. When one goes into these workshops one sees people happy in their jobs, and they are productive jobs. However, because this workshop exceeds the number in the Act, it might be closed down. That seems farcical to me. There needs to be much greater flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice Senator Button looking up. I could take him to see this centre in Shepparton. It is a tremendous set-up. I could take him to the Horsham wool factory and show him a most innovative program where they are growing fine merino wool and selling it to a Japanese company, at a huge price per bale. This wool is grown in controlled climatic conditions and the fibre is totally constant throughout. In that same workshop projects are being undertaken for the State Electricity Commission. A number of printing works are being done. People are shifted around and they are multi-skilled. An effort is being made on the part of those people to get their employees into open employment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that are very obvious to me as I move around, especially in rural Victoria, is that it is very difficult for people with disabilities to find work in open employment, given our current youth unemployment figure in Victoria of 30.6 per cent. Almost one in every three young people in Victoria is unemployed. Yet we have a government program, designed to place people with disabilities in open employment, doomed to failure. Successful projects which have the possibility of becoming viable businesses are closing down. There is no consideration of the fact that we may need different services for different areas-rural and city. There is a formula coming out of Canberra which is supposed to apply across-the-board. One of the things that I am constantly told is that, with all the goodwill in the world, it is very difficult, in rural Victoria in particular but also in the metropolitan areas, to find open employment. So what will we have by 1992? People with disabilities will be on the scrap heap alongside the youth of our country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Disability Services Act heralded this Government's policy of open employment for people with disabilities but it is time for the Government to start getting its own house in order. Between 1987 and 1990 a mere two out of 51 Commonwealth agencies improved their disabled employee ratio, whilst 44 went backwards. The question I asked of the Department of Community Services and Health in Estimates was: how many departments have increased their employment of people with disabilities since the Government has had a program of open employment for people with disabilities? The answer was two: two Federal government departments had increased their employment of people with disabilities. Who is supposed to bear the brunt of this? It is the private sector and/or people with disabilities who cannot find jobs, and/or the sector looking after people with disabilities. That is who bears the burden. The Government has got only two of its own departments responding to the need that is created by this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is little wonder that many service providers tell me how hard it is to obtain employment for disabled people in State and Commonwealth public services. As I said, it is a particular problem in rural areas where alternative employment options for disabled people are minimal. When one asks service providers in those rural areas, `Why won't the government departments employ them?', they say things such as, `The unions say there could be an industrial relations problem. They may cause accidents so we cannot have them in the statutory authority or government department'. Little is done by Brian Howe stamping his fists on the desk unless he has the courage to rectify the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we rectify the problems that the Disability Services Act has brought upon people with disabilities in this country? The Act itself must be made more flexible and there must also be greater flexibility in how the Act is interpreted and implemented. There may be natural contracting of the original sheltered workshops with the entrance of new participants, but the old and the new services should be able to coexist happily. We are not going to change this situation overnight. There must be greater recognition that people with differing disabilities have differing employment and accommodation needs. We have to recognise that some people have been in institutions or in sheltered workshops for long periods, and for them the transition is going to take a long time. It may be easier with young people moving straight from school into the new concept that the Act brings in. As I said, the sector and the Opposition support the basic objectives of the Act. However, its implementation has been appalling. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should recognise the continuing need for a diverse and flexible range of choices and opportunities for disabled people, including sheltered workshops and activity centres-ones that reflect a new view and the change that has occurred. Let us admit that across all sectors-aged care, disability services, education-there are constant changes. Those services adapt to those changes, and sheltered workshops and activity centres also can adapt and address the new views. The centres do not have to be bad just because they are larger. If we do not respond in this way, there will be a failure to provide a smooth transition from school to service and then to employment and community living for a very important group of people-that is, those who have a disability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I follow Senator Patterson on the same issue of people with disabilities and their providers who are attempting at the moment to work under the Disability Services Act. Indeed, the providers are very concerned about the implementation of the Act. I want to quote from just a few of the many letters I have received pointing out that the same problem occurs over and over again with the various providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the letters I received said that in the early stages funding was to be determined by client needs-that is, a maximum of 35 hours a week per client with high needs at a set rate of up to $18 an hour. When agreement was reached, we were advised that these rates would apply only to new services: existing services would continue to be funded at the level currently agreed to. However, to maintain even that level we were to change the service to meet the guidelines of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> All the letters say-and virtually every organisation says-that the intention, the aim, of the Disability Services Act is superb and they agree with it; it is the implementation that they have great difficulty with. They say they find that provision of the service, which means the guidelines of the Disability Services Act, is considerably more costly to deliver than in the past. They say that costs have gone up generally through inflation and the indexation applies to annual block grants and does not meet the increased costs. Consequently, they find themselves falling further and further behind each year. One group states:</PARA>
<PARA> We have recently graduated 9 people from our Life Skills Service. They have acquired the skills our service provides. They have now returned to their own home and in many cases will regress within a period of six months. They will then need to return to the service for retraining. This will remain the case in the majority of graduates as they have no `next step' to move on to. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, we have now been forced to set an occupancy limit of 21 clients for Life Skill Service. </PARA>
<PARA>So it has had to decrease the number of disabled to whom it has in the past been able to provide a service. The letter from the group then points out that if its funding deteriorates further, it will be forced to reduce staff and services to 16 clients by the end of 1991. The group is very concerned, as is every organisation, that the Disability Services Act, with its very good aims and intentions, is so far behind in terms of funding that it makes it impossible for it to carry out the intention of the Act. I am told in another letter that the Disability Services Act:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . also promised to offer flexibility and freedom to choose. Yet the people who are quite happy living in smaller supported accommodation services, say, 20-bed homes, are told they do not meet the criteria for section 10 of the Act. They will need to move to a group home or community accommodation to meet the guidelines of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Those people were told that they had to move to a home of five, even though they had been used to 20 and wanted to stay where they were. They were told that they were going to be offered flexibility and freedom to choose, but that flexibility and freedom have been taken away and they have been told they must move out into smaller accommodation. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> As stated in the beginning of the letter, the Act is in line with our ideals and aspirations and it would be a shame if organisations providing these outcomes were forced to the wall whilst those who have not moved on to adopt the objectives of the Act continue to hold people with disability back. </PARA>
<PARA>Another letter says:</PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, I can honestly say the Disability Services Act has been great for people with disability who are already in a section 10-13 service. It has been difficult for the service providers who have been forced to `rattle the can' to survive and an absolute disaster for those people who have not entered a service and are trying to obtain assistance in their own home. </PARA>
<PARA>Time and time again children coming out of school are not looked after. We have some very good sheltered workshops in our State, as I am sure you would agree, Mr Acting Deputy President. There are some very good workshops making highclass furniture and, indeed, they export the result of their work to other States. But they are not allowed to backfill, so we have 18-year-olds coming out of special schools who cannot get the service because there is nowhere they can go to be trained in these ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Other providers looking after children and younger people include St Giles Society in Tasmania and the Launceston Student Workshop, which I have mentioned in this place before. They are doing a magnificent job, but they cannot understand why the Commonwealth picks up only the disabled aged from 18 to 65. They say there is very little difference between a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old, and why a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old should be funded under State legislation while those aged 18 and over are funded under Commonwealth legislation is a mystery to them. </PARA>
<PARA> These providers ask, `Please let us get under the same funding so we can have some continuity for various age groups'. Continuity is absolutely essential. Several people have written and I have said that all this goes back to the same old thing-this service is no longer client driven. If clients prefer an option at odds with the Act-say another group-and wish to remain within the service, it appears that is recorded as a failure on behalf of the service providers to facilitate integration. The groups also complain that the total lack of services for young school leavers and people not previously registered with agencies-due to the closed door policy-is a disaster for those newly requiring disability accommodation and services of any sort. </PARA>
<PARA> Another group tells me that the Department of Community Services and Health cannot guarantee funding for programs that are required to be implemented under the Disability Services Act-in that group's case, the implementation of outcomes of the individual program plans. The departmental officers cannot and will not guarantee funding for next year. The group says that this lack of confidence in forward funding means that its planning is hesitant and that its confidence is being undermined. It says that the Disability Services Act has to be looked at again. </PARA>
<PARA> A very big provider says that there still remains an immovable, stubborn bureaucracy led by a similarly endowed Minister that believes, or is led to believe, that each and every disabled person can find meaningful, fully paid employment within our community. That is impossible at the best of times, let alone in the current recession. This belief has many consequences in the implementation of the Disability Services Act. First and foremost is the lack of practical knowledge of the transient staff from the Department of Community Services and Health which, if anything, has worsened over the last 12 months. That complaint is made so often. The provider says that it speaks to one departmental officer one day and that the following week or month when it goes back and looks for that officer it finds the officer has gone and there is a new one. So the provider has to start all over again. Transient staff, we are told, is one of the main concerns that the providers have; they never speak to the same officer twice. It is a real problem for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The providers say that a second impediment is the equally acute lack of resources. One provider says that there is an acute lack of resources both in manpower and finance to effectively implement the desired strategies, due partly to priorities being established to fund new model services at the expense of current services. They say that the defunding of services has been brought to the attention of project officers and departmental staff on numerous occasions, always with the same response-and I have had that response given to me by the Minister in this place-which is, `More money than ever has gone into the Disability Services Act and what you are saying is not true'. One group states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . however they conveniently miss out on the fact that a lot more services are being funded by the same pool of money, all existing services with whom I have contact, without exception, have experienced a defunding in their subsidies over the last three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department has put out a minimum outcomes booklet. Minister, please take note of this debate. We are coming to you in the Senate from the various organisations that are putting to you their problems. They all complain about transient staff. They all complain that there is not the flexibility that was originally promised to them. They all complain that they have not got the funding. They all complain about the lack of ability to backfill. Minister, you sit there reading something else, taking little notice, or no notice at all, of what we are saying. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that if the officers in the various States are not getting through to the Minister in this regard, at least senators ought to be able to. Yet he sits there reading something totally different, not taking the slightest interest in what I am speaking about-the lifeblood of the disabled in my State. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.12 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to raise a subject which is of great concern to the already crippled rural sector, and that is the question of imported pigmeat. There remains a massive anxiety among pig producers in Western Australia, and I believe the anxiety is shared across the country, that the health of their herds and the profitability of their industry are being jeopardised by the continued imports of Canadian pigmeat. On the evidence, they have a deep concern that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has significantly underestimated the risk of infection from the transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In raising this matter, I do not in any way support the use of quarantine as a disguised measure of trade protection, and I fully appreciate that Australia must set a positive example in this respect. This is not a trade issue. This is a quarantine issue, it is a health issue, and it is an issue that goes right across this country and has the potential to impact on our export markets, to say nothing of the serious impact on the rural sector itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I would not criticise the Lindsay model of bio-economic analysis based upon minimal risk rather than no risk. Under this model, however, imports should not proceed where there is a high risk of infection together with severe consequences should it take hold. I know that you yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, have been very involved in a number of these areas of concern to the rural sector, and this is one subject I would hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, who is on duty in the chamber at the moment, would listen to, even though he sought not to listen to the very serious speech that my colleague Senator Walters made before me. There is some very impressive evidence assembled by the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) that shows that a high risk of TGE infection could be present in frozen imports from a country where the virus is endemic. While this evidence may not be conclusive, it is surely sufficiently compelling to justify more experimentation and argument from AQIS than has been the case so far. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about a disease that entrenched itself across the Northern Hemisphere in 20 years after its first occurrence in the United States of America (US) in 1946. Recovered pigs continue to shed the virus for at least another three weeks, and the disease spreads rapidly among live animals at collection points, requiring an extremely small dose, as transmission can be effected with a one part per million dilution of gastrointestinal filtrates from infected pigs. A study in Iowa showed that carcass contamination rates can reach 1 : 250 in endemic areas. To say the least, this is at variance with the Canadian assessment of a carcass contamination rate of less than 1 : 10 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the disease is endemic, it can be expected that the virus will be present in 20 to 35 per cent of market age animals, and, in such areas as the US Mid West, herd prevalence reaches 50 per cent. That is of great concern in Australia and I encourage the Government to relook at all of this and make sure that what has happened in the United States and Canada does not happen in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As TGE was first reported in Canada in 1964 and herd prevalence had reached 19 per cent in Quebec in 1971, we can safely assume that a far higher rate is evident in Canada today. The virus is widely distributed about the body, making it likely to survive the slaughtering process, and is stable for long periods when frozen for several days at 21 degrees Centigrade, and for several hours when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence of research from Drs Baldock and Webster, of the Australian Veterinary Association, from which I am quoting, casts doubts upon the AQIS estimate of an annual TGE risk of 1 : 3.3 million from Canadian pigmeat. They conclude that the annual risk is 1 : 30, which over 10 years would accumulate to a rate of 1 : 3.5. This is certainly a worst case scenario and it may be open to challenge, but it must not be dismissed out of hand. Their belief is based upon a study of literature, results from experiments at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, demonstrating that the virus survives freezing, and a study made in Iowa by Dr Cook of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries. To say the least, it is evidence that deserves the most careful attention by AQIS and the Minister for Resources. Given the seriousness of TGE, I do not believe that sufficiently close attention has been paid to this evidence, either now or in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> In a practical sense, transmission of the virus is possible from imported pigmeat should it end up on the rubbish dumps to which feral pigs have access, with risk increasing the more widely the product is distributed. Again, it is fair to ask whether the investigations by AQIS took into account the reservoir effect that feral pigs can have in the long term spread of the disease. The virus can be spread via dogs, cats, foxes and rodents, and, sadly, even house flies. Once in Australia it would disseminate rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> We should question the assurance given by Senator Cook as Minister for Resources on 27 September 1989 that any outbreak of TGE would be contained by internal quarantine, slaughter and disinfecting of the piggery concerned. Unfortunately, Senator Cook has shown, on that occasion and subsequently, a great lack of understanding of the seriousness of this problem with TGE. Until such time as the Government is prepared to relook at this, this has the potential to run wild right through the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very much aware of the argument raised in defence of the decision to allow Canadian pigmeat imports-that they have occurred in New Zealand for a number of years without ill effect. However, risk increases with volume and we are talking about minor imports to a small market. The pigmeat industry in New Zealand is not significant. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context there is a feeling that, if the Australian pigmeat industry were larger, greater attention would be paid to its quarantine requirements. I do not think we should necessarily try to look only at ensuring that a particularly large industry is safe; we must look at the whole industry. If it is a relatively small industry such as the pigmeat industry, that should not preclude it from close attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that once the TGE virus takes hold, it will have severe consequences for Australian producers of pigmeat. The TGE virus causes vomiting and diarrhoea that can cause 100 per cent mortality in piglets under three weeks old and it reduces the production efficiency of lactating sows. The disease can escape diagnosis among older pigs, but once established it remains in larger herds as new litters are successively infected. </PARA>
<PARA> The resulting loss would reduce cash surplus for an average piggery with 100 sows from $26,300 to $11,500. We must remember that this represents only the cost of the initial outbreak, without estimating ongoing losses once the TGE virus is established. Prospects of exporting pigmeat to Asia would be dashed through the loss of our disease-free status, and that is yet another area in which I do not believe we can put this industry at risk. If ever there were a time in this country that we needed to make sure that every export market is rock solid and able to be extended, not restricted, then that time is now. If we lose that disease-free status, then the whole export market is a goner. </PARA>
<PARA> Producers in an efficient rural industry have a right to be gravely concerned at the possibility that AQIS has not done a sufficiently thorough job of risk assessment under the Lindsay model. AQIS has failed to treat the TGE virus as a major disease, thus requiring a full economic assessment, and it has not given sufficient weight to the objections of agricultural authorities in Western Australia and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> AQIS appears to differ from the AVA in respect of the significance of resistance to freezing by the TGE virus, but it has not addressed that point. There is disquiet as to whether reports provided to AQIS by the Bureau of Rural Research have been fully considered by AQIS and the Minister for Resources. Such a report as that of 10 August 1990 does not endorse the Baldock and Webster paper but differs significantly from the sweeping criticism from AQIS. At the same time, we would wish to be assured that the advice from AQIS was not in any way coloured by Canadian pressure to finalise the matter last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, I stand strongly by the criticism that I made in October 1989, when the former Minister for Resources, now Minister for Industrial Relations, stated that Canadian pigmeats proved an acceptable risk without further discussions with pig veterinarians and prior to the receipt of an assessment by Dr Baldock. As I say, it was almost two years ago that I raised this issue in the Senate, and today we are still no further advanced because, on 5 September 1989, Senator Cook had stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are further assessments to be made and the decision will be made in due course . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And yet, three days later, the initial decision to approve imports was made. He also assured the Senate that the decision would be made upon quarantine grounds alone. Since the final announcement was made in July 1990 and imports commenced in August, 800 tonnes of Canadian pigmeat have been imported. Producers have the right to know that the risk assessment was thoroughly investigated, that opposing points of view received due consideration from AQIS, and that if risks could not be ascertained, a conservative approach would be adopted. Producers are still waiting for the TGE virus to become a compensable disease should it be discovered that the 1 : 3.3 million risk assessment was indeed way off beam. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention in raising this matter to imply any generalised censure of AQIS in terms of the professionalism of its officers. It is, however, a fact that an organisation and its Ministers can get something wrong, and I am strongly suggesting that there is a weight of evidence that the decision to allow the importation of Canadian pigmeat posed a greater quarantine risk than is acceptable under the principles of the Lindsay model. </PARA>
<PARA> Producers have all the more right to know that AQIS and the Minister will give the fullest consideration to effective minimal quarantine given the spread of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, or mystery swine disease (MSD), in North America and northern Europe. This disease causes stillbirths, piglet deaths and loss of growth, and the outbreak of MSD in a 250-sow piggery cost one US producer $A86,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we know there is minimal risk of it being carried in carcasses and meat products, AQIS and this Government have a responsibility to look again at the import of pigmeat from any country, such as Canada, where MSD is spreading rapidly. I repeat: Australia must adhere to a minimal risk quarantine policy and practise what it preaches. This must not, however, involve us in failing to investigate all possible threats to the viability of a rural industry from an introduced disease. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) would do well to direct the Minister for Resources to look again at all evidence regarding TGE and to ensure that AQIS has considered it. Pigmeat producers, and rural industry generally, deserve no less. I am greatly disturbed that the Government, over almost two years, has seen fit to do absolutely nothing about assuring the industry that it will be safe and assuring Australians generally that the importation of Canadian pigmeat is not creating a risk in this country that could spread rapidly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to be brief so that I could get up and have lunch, but after Senator Knowles's raising of the issues affecting pigmeat I certainly will not be going to the dining room and eating pork today-unless it is Australian pork! Obviously, Senator Knowles, that was a pig of an issue to have to deal with in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unemployment statistics will be the focus of public attention today. I do not want to focus on today's release of statistics; I want to look at unemployment statistics in a way in which they are not generally publicly understood. They are normally looked at on a State-by-State basis, with various Premiers claiming that their States are doing better than other States. During the New South Wales election, we saw the comparison between New South Wales, with an unemployment rate then of 8.9 per cent, and other rates in the vicinity of 10 per cent. From such statistics one can draw what comparisons one can about the management State by State. </PARA>
<PARA> The other way that unemployment statistics are dealt with in Australia is by putting a very proper focus on the effect of unemployment on young Australians. I think the figures we will be seeing today show another disastrous rise in youth unemployment statistics as opposed to the general unemployment rate. The way I would like to look at unemployment today is to do some comparisons of industry sectors. They show some alarming trends which I think are worth while putting on the record and bringing to the attention and the interest of the public in this public interest discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> Across Australia we have had a massive increase in unemployment, but it has affected some industry sectors far worse than others. The retail sector is the hardest hit sector, according to the statistics that I have been able to find. In terms of job losses, the retail sector has seen a loss across Australia of 54,000 people in the last 12 months. The next hardest hit sector is construction, which has seen 40,000 people lose their jobs during that same 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> The other sectors which have been very badly hit are agriculture and agricultural services. I do not have national figures for them, but in my State of Western Australia the increase in unemployment has been about 163 per cent in the agricultural sector alone and 345 per cent in agricultural services-which, obviously, has a significant effect in the country, particularly in rural and regional centres, where people are losing their jobs and leaving, and I guess they are returning to the capital cities, with consequent increases in demand for services and in crime rates and so on in those cities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, some bright spots on the employment picture. One of them is the communications industry. I referred to some figures in my contribution to the debate on the Telecommunications Bill last night. The communications industry has noticed an increase in employment and it has experienced the lowest growth in unemployment. In other words, the growth there has been just 5 per cent and it currently has an unemployment rate of 2.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important industry that has suffered very badly during this downturn is the recreation and tourism industry. That has been hit very hard. In Western Australia there has been a loss of about 5,000 jobs in that sector alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect on youth is interesting. Across the sectors that I have referred to already, particularly the retail sector and the tourism and accommodation sectors, one would naturally assume that they are sectors which have a large capacity to employ young Australians. The massive unemployment increases in these sectors have affected the prospects of young Australians more than increases in any other sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to look at what has happened to public sector employment during this period. With job losses I have already described in construction of 40,000 people and in the retail sector of 54,000 people across Australia, what, you may well ask, has happened to Federal Government and State Government employment during this period? The answer is quite alarming. There has actually been an increase of 13,000 people across Australia under the employment of Federal and State governments during the past 12 months. So at a time when the productive sectors of the Australian economy-the private sector, the various sectors that I have referred to-are laying off tens of thousands of Australian workers who want to work and to contribute and who want to look after their families and pay their own way in this society, and at a time when Federal and State Labor governments across this nation are preaching the rhetoric of cutting government, making things more efficient and reducing taxation and micro-reforming, the reality is that there has been an increase of 13,000 people in the public sector. This is a matter of some concern because, obviously, for every person put onto the payroll of the State and Federal governments, someone will have to pay for it and, of course, it is usually the poor old PAYE taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to look at what has happened in one particular sector, clearly a very featherbedded and protected sector when it comes to employment, and that is the waterfront. We have had an economic downturn-a recession we had to have from a Treasurer we did not have to have-and across all of the areas of employment we have seen massive increases of unemployment. But let us look at the waterfront, where we have this much-vaunted policy of waterfront reform defended on a daily basis by the Minister responsible, Senator Collins. We have seen a downturn in trade through the waterfront across Australia's ports of about 35 per cent. We have a redundancy program which he keeps defending. Figures released recently by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority show that his number of redundancies is only 85 per cent of the level he should have achieved by October last year. So the program is a long way behind even though he is not prepared to admit it. Here we have a sector where there is a massive downturn in the amount of throughput and where employment is very high, remaining stubbornly opposed to the redundancy program of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to look at in response to all of these fairly boring statistics is the sort of balance we want between the public and private sectors in Australia. The approach of the Opposition clearly is to ensure that government is looked at very objectively. We have to look at the role of government, and the only way one can reduce government is to start privatising, contracting out some of the services provided by government, and to ensure that the public sector does not become too great a burden on the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government and its Labor State cronies have got it all wrong.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the chamber, particularly the Minister, to the matters I raised on this Bill on 8 May 1991. I particularly raised this question so as to get a response from the Government. The question is the discrimination that is experienced by a number of women in regard to superannuation policies. I referred particularly to the submission that I think most, if not all, senators received-presumably the leaders of the parties received it-from Women's Action Alliance on superannuation policy. I had hoped that the Government would have considered this matter and been able to respond to some of the questions that I raised in the debate on 8 May on this legislation. I pointed out then the very severe discrimination, taxation-wise and otherwise, experienced by women who are part of a one-income family. Here we have a matter of major sex discrimination whereby women who are employed full time in the task of child rearing are discriminated against by virtue of this Government's current policies. I quote from what was said on that occasion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Currently, women at home are not able to cover themselves for superannuation, yet for the reasons already indicated it is as important for them as for women in paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Then I pointed out that there is particularly discrimination against women in one-income families in the matter of contributions, in the matter of reasonable benefits limits, and in the area of taxation of lump sum. In all of those areas, as I pointed out on 8 May, there is significant discrimination against these women. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Minister not focused on the matters that I raised on that occasion? Why have they been ignored? Why have his officials not at least given him a brief about this matter? It is a very serious matter; it affects a lot of people. I had deliberately asked in my speech for the Government to have a good look at what I had stated. I am expecting a reply now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The paper to which Senator Harradine refers has been drawn to my attention. The whole question of superannuation is important and is under major review and examination by the Government. The paper that the honourable senator has referred to has been discussed with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which I think is the appropriate body to discuss it with in the first place, and it will be high on the agenda of papers drawn to the attention of the new Treasurer. The honourable senator would understand that that transition has delayed some of the decision making at that level, but I am conscious of the point he raised. It is not being ignored or underestimated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without giving a detailed response, because this is not in my area of expertise, I can say that it is a matter that we have already discussed with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and which the new Treasurer will be giving consideration to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three comments I want to make, and I think I might as well make them on this motion. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs considered the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill. It was referred to the Committee because of the complex areas of law involved in the interrelationship between sex discrimination and superannuation. In that Committee the Opposition moved two amendments which were unsuccessful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you would be aware, Mr Chairman, at present there are exemptions from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act with respect to superannuation and insurance. It was always intended that these exemptions would operate for only a limited period. The then Human Rights Commission report on the superannuation exemption was tabled as long ago as 1986. It recommended that superannuation schemes should be made to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of the sex discrimination legislation. This Bill, in fact, represents the Government's third attempt to pass legislation to reduce the number of circumstances in which superannuation funds may discriminate on the grounds of sex or marital status. </PARA>
<PARA> I said some time ago, at the second reading stage, that the Opposition supported the Bill because it introduced what has been described as modest and sensible reform-although, as I indicated, it has been a long time in coming. However, there were two aspects of the Bill with which we had considerable difficulty and which we took to the Committee in the form of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of those amendments related to clause 7, which deals with acts done under statutory authority. This Bill amends the Act by replacing the existing system, whereby exemptions to the Act are effected by way of regulation, with a system of specifically naming the legislation from which exemptions have been provided. The Opposition is of the view that an exemption should be provided in relation to the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern was particularly in relation to sham marriages. The concern arises because, unlike any other country, we provide for the entry of people to Australia who are in de facto relationships. We do not discriminate on the grounds of marital status in our migration laws. But examination of behaviour profiles has shown that there is a greater chance of people using the change of status mechanism to obtain entry into Australia against our law if they are living in a de facto relationship than if they are living in a marriage relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations came to the view that, in considering de facto relationships, the first thing that should be established is whether the relationship is a proven relationship of cohabitation for at least 12 months. However, the Committee was told that, under the Sex Discrimination Act, that requirement was unreasonable because it was not being asked of marriage partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee suggested that another way of checking the bona fides of de facto couples would be to see whether they remained together after they were allowed entry, by having a period of two years temporary entry to Australia after which a fresh assessment could be made. The Government decided that the two-year conditional residence period should apply in all cases, bearing in mind the implications of the Sex Discrimination Act and the fact that abuse of the change of status mechanism also arises in the case of legal marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, whilst there was some abuse in the case of legally married couples, it was not of the same order as that occurring in de facto relationships. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs now has to check every case of both marriage and de facto change of status application within two years of entry to Australia which is, in our view, an unnecessary drain on the Department's resources. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, the Opposition takes the view that the decisions taken in compliance with the Migration Act should be exempt from the operation of the sex discrimination legislation. On behalf of the Opposition, I moved an amendment in the Standing Committee to that effect but, regrettably, it did not receive the necessary support-which means that the Democrats opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's second amendment related to the option to transfer to non-discriminatory benefits for the purposes of proposed section 41b. For those purposes, such an option must be offered and exercised within a two-month period and before the commencement of that section. Pursuant to this Opposition amendment, the option must still have been exercisable within a two-month period, but the outer limit would have been up to 12 months after commencement of the section. </PARA>
<PARA> As I noted during the second reading, the Bill provides for a two-year period from the date on which the Act receives royal assent before the commencement of those sections containing exemptions relating to superannuation and insurance schemes. This falls short of the three-year transition period recommended by the Human Rights Commission in its reports. The Opposition amendment, effectively, was to increase the transition period to three years in relation to the option to transfer to non-discriminatory benefits. The purpose of the Opposition's amendment was to allow the superannuation industry time to adjust to the new requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in the Committee, the question really comes down to whether two years is an adequate time in which to undertake this very major structural alteration and to ensure that all options have been covered and the rights of individual policy holders have been properly taken into account. It was pointed out by Mr Stevens, on behalf of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, that the superannuation industry comprises in excess of 100,000 funds operated by diverse groups and individuals all over the country. Although the Association is committed to keeping its members well-informed, and it probably covers about 80 per cent of the total membership of funds, it covers only about 750 of the 100,000 funds as direct members. There would be a large number of funds which would not be prepared for this change in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition shares the industry's view that two years is an inadequate time to adjust to the new provisions and, therefore, I moved an amendment to extend the limit by up to 12 months. Again, unfortunately, the amendment was unsuccessful, as the Democrats voted with the Government. We can only hope, for the sake of members of the superannuation industry and its many thousands of contributors, that time does not prove us right with our concerns. Therefore, whilst we are disappointed that our amendments were unsuccessful, nevertheless, in accordance with the sentiment that I expressed in my second reading contribution to this debate, the Opposition will support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are Bills on which anybody might speak for half an hour on each if the time were available. However, I think that we will be doing veterans a service if we pass them by 2 o'clock. I will speak very briefly on behalf of Senator Newman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 was a significant development in veterans' legislation and at the time was seen to be a major simplification-and perhaps it was-but five years later that is no longer the case. For a long time veterans and war widows have expressed their exasperation with the way it was operating and the amendments made to it. We welcome this Bill as one which we hope will simplify and bring together the legislation, making it operate. It is widely welcomed by the veteran community. I shall not go into the details of it other than to say that it comes into the category of the plain English version; it has alphabetical listing of terms, definitions and an index and, hopefully, its objectives will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Veterans' Entitlements (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991 is, as stated, a transitional Bill, the most salient point being, perhaps, the Budget changes to part 3 of the Act which are the deeming provisions relating to income assessment for the service pension. The deeming provisions have, in many instances, proved very difficult for aged pensioners and service pensioners. This Bill will significantly assist in the operation of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has stated that the rewrite legislation will not in any way affect the responsibilities of the Repatriation Commission towards veterans and their dependants. I think it is important that that should be the case. However, the Opposition puts the Government on notice that it must honour its promise to quickly and effectively address any unforeseen anomalies should they emerge at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 deals with entitlements. Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, as it stands, dependants of female veterans do not have the same access to benefits as dependants of male veterans and are not entitled to defence service home loans. We welcome this Bill because it corrects these inequalities. The extension of the repatriation benefits will be backdated to 22 January but the defence service home entitlement only takes effect from the time of royal assent to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> It also includes provision for automatic indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance and introduces a number of minor changes associated with the administration of service pensions. We believe that all anomalies and discrimination should be removed, that is those which are on the ground of the Veteran's gender, such as discrimination against the widower of an ex-service woman. The Gulf war highlighted the need for this. We were initially dismayed when the Government publicly indicated that it would not be doing anything about it in January, and we were pleased that by 22 January it announced that these anomalies would be redressed. </PARA>
<PARA> We support all three of these Bills. I do not want the brevity of the Opposition's remarks on them in any way to indicate lack of desire to support them or lack of concern about the veterans' community. It is merely to take the opportunity to have the Bills passed. </PARA>

With the result of a survey of best quality cars, conducted jointly by Wheels magazine and the National Roads and Motorists Association, revealing that Japanese cars head the list of best quality cars, with Australian produced Ford and Holden thirteenth and fourteenth respectively, what action has the Government taken to improve the quality of Australian made cars?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question could be asked in any country except Japan, with the possible exception of Germany, relating to one or maybe two car manufacturers. An improvement in the quality of locally produced cars, of course, continues to be an objective of the Government's policy for the automotive industry. Quality is a significant determinant of competitiveness against imports and in entering potential export markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Automotive Industry Authority monitors the quality of Australian made and imported cars. This information is published by the Automotive Industry Authority in its annual Report on the State of the Automotive Industry report. In its 1990 report, that Authority found there had been a general improvement in the quality of locally produced cars. However, it also confirmed that there was a quality gap between locally produced and imported Japanese cars.</PARA>
<PARA> This disparity arises from several sources. Clearly, the nature of quality control procedures incorporated into production is critical. Australian car makers are achieving significant gains in this area. However, the survey shows that it is how these gains measure up relative to the procedures adopted by overseas competitors that is critical. It is very important to recognise the disparity in economies of scale between Australian and Japanese producers. This disparity is reflected in the lower levels of investment which Australian firms are able to make in improving production, efficiency and quality control. I make the observation that certain statements made by the Opposition spokesman on this issue showed a total ignorance of that fact.</PARA>
<PARA> I should make the point, which I referred to at the beginning, that Japanese built cars are now considered to have the best build quality in the world. In this respect, they set a very exacting standard that car manufacturers in the United States and Europe are having difficulty in competing against. Indeed, there are import restraint measures imposed by the European Community for countries within the European Community and, of course, by the United States against imported cars.</PARA>
<PARA> The new automotive arrangements announced by the Government on 12 March will create an environment where local producers must respond to the competitive pressures arising from reduced government assistance and develop export markets in order to capture the benefits of increased economies of scale in production. Arrangements will therefore provide the competitive pressure for the Australian industry to improve its product quality, as well as the opportunity through expanded export production to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> In a more direct manner, the Government is also assisting groups, such as the component industry in Australia, to develop links with the Japanese automotive industry as a means of stimulating improvements in quality control. I must add that, on my visit to Japan in February, some of the Japanese car manufacturers made the observation-which was not gratuitous and they did not need to make it-that the quality of the production of their cars in Australia had improved immensely in the last year or so.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a lot of excitement on the other side. Honourable senators opposite should simmer down and listen to the answer. I take it that Senator Baume is one of those who offer some sort of blind allegiance. He certainly used to when Margaret Thatcher was leader of the Tories in the United Kingdom. In the absence of any idea to fill the vacuum in Opposition members' heads, off they used to trot to get some ideology from Margaret Thatcher-Margaret Thatcher, who produced 12.5 per cent unemployment in Great Britain. Now the latest trips are being made to New Zealand to get some wisdom from Mr Bolger about how to conduct economic policy- Mr Bolger, who presides over a figure of 9.6 per cent unemployment in New Zealand. This is the sort of context in which this question must be seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the employment figures are concerned, let me make this point: it is true that the number of employed persons fell marginally, but the participation rate fell markedly, by 0.4 per cent, and the participation rate in Australia remained artificially high in the figures produced in previous months which the Opposition was so happy about. The net result is a marked fall of 40,000 in the number of unemployed persons in Australia. These figures are not ones which bring any joy to the Government, but I must say that, in the light of anticipation of a higher unemployment figure than was actually produced in today's announcement, the Government has some satisfaction in them.</PARA>

I remind the Minister that I did not ask him whether he was concerned. We found out when I asked about this last October that he was not concerned when he said that youth unemployment was falling. I now ask the Minister once again: what hope does the Minister hold out for the near record 27.5 per cent of young Australians aged between 15 and 19 years who are shown in today's official statistics as unable to find full time work? I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, rather than there being a fall, as he tried to obfuscate the situation, there has been a 30 per cent increase over the past 12 months in the number of young people out of work, which figure now totals 116,400 looking for full time work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. They are comprehensively inaccurate. I must say, having had some personal dealings with Mr Gruzman over the Rockin' Robin loss, that I am profoundly disappointed, in consideration of the conversations I had with him privately, that he could be the author of such an appallingly inaccurate article which was given such comprehensive coverage by the Bulletin. I was particularly disturbed and regretful about the extraordinary picture he painted of the manner in which the men lost in that incident died. It must have been of some distress to the families of those men who died to read Mr Gruzman's account of it in the Bulletin, because his account of it is totally at variance with the facts that are known about the loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I have to say that in the comprehensively executed investigation that was subsequently carried out into the incident, the report of which was tabled in the Senate, the sad fact is that in all these circumstances it is most probable that they died in those appalling weather conditions on the same night that the yacht was lost. All of the evidence points to that. That is the conclusion that the post-accident investigation came to. It accords precisely--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course she has not. The appalling weather conditions at the time were, as experienced crewmen who were rescued in a separate rescue said, the worst conditions that they had seen in 30 years of sailing. The yacht was lost at a great distance from the Australian coast. I was profoundly disappointed to see in that article that the only reference to the involvement of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was a claim that it inaccurately dropped rescue equipment, with not a single word about the 50 personnel who literally risked their lives in the most appalling weather conditions, flying Orion aircraft in 70-knot winds below a cloud base that got down to 500 feet, in an attempt to save the lives of those men. Not a single word was said about the people who risked their lives to try to rescue those men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that, in appalling weather conditions, with extremely rough seas and winds gusting to 70 knots, the RAAF aircraft, far from being inaccurate-in fact, with considerable accuracy and skill-dropped the life raft in precisely the correct position upwind of the disabled yacht. In fact, that equipment landed in precisely the spot where it was supposed to land. This feat was made more difficult by the fact that the yacht was sailing across the wind at 6 knots at the time. The article is riddled with inaccuracies.</PARA>
<PARA> The incident itself was thoroughly investigated. The report of the investigation was comprehensive. It was based on eye witness accounts and not the flights of fancy indulged in by Mr Gruzman, and they do him no credit. The investigation concluded that, on the heavy balance of probabilities, as I have already said, at least two persons, and probably three, were unsupported in the heavy seas by midday on the first day, that is, 8 June 1990, and in the severe conditions they probably died shortly thereafter.</PARA>

The final sighting of the raft, which had been occupied, was in mid-afternoon, when it was reported as being badly deflated and in a sinking condition, with only one person seen lying across it. The raft was never seen again and it has to be assumed that it either sank very soon after or became so badly deflated that it provided no effective means of life support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have nothing but the highest praise for the courage and skill of all the aircraft and ship crews involved in the attempt to rescue these four people. The conditions out there could only be described as atrocious. They were described by the senior RAAF officer at the time as `extremely hazardous' for flying. They presented a considerable danger to the potential rescuers, and Mr Gruzman's article is in fact absolutely scurrilous to the people who were involved in that rescue.</PARA>
<PARA> In discussions I had with Mr Gruzman, I agreed to the purchase of the necessary pump equipment that he sells.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. I refer the Minister to his letter to me dated 4 June-the dates here are important-admitting that Senator Richardson's statement to the Senate on 29 May that no new tracks had been bulldozed and no trees had been cut on Beecroft Peninsula at Jervis Bay during Exercise Termite Spray was `not correct'. I further note the Minister's statement that he was `advised that it was not clear until . . . 1 June that some new tracks had . . . been cut', and that `there is no direct evidence that the trees were cut down by Army during the exercise'. I also note that on 4 May a local resident, Mr Arvan Pritchard, saw an army truck laden with cut casuarina trees and a chain saw about 300 metres from fresh stumps and that Beecroft Range Commander David Minolis was sent a report of this sighting by rangers on 23 May. I ask the Minister: why has he failed to inform the Senate that it had been misinformed by Senator Richardson, using advice supplied by Minister Ray. Secondly, given that I have reliable evidence that all relevant officials-namely, Commodore Rob Partington, Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Cullen, Range Commander Minolis, and the Defence facilities branch-knew of the new tracks and the cut trees by 25 May at the latest, why was the Minister advised that these facts did not become clear until 1 June? Given that direct evidence that the trees were cut by the Army was provided to Range Commander Minolis on 23 May, why was the Minister advised that no such evidence existed? Finally, in order to clarify this serious matter, will the Minister undertake to table all documents and correspondence on Termite Spray?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4516" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts of the situation as it currently stands are as follows. The advice given by Senator Richardson was on the basis of advice from the Department of Defence, and therefore he has no responsibility in the sense of that advice. Firstly, I have to say that, despite Senator Coulter's assertion that service officials had prior knowledge of the cutting of these trees and the opening of new tracks, no doubt on this matter had been raised with me until 30 May-that is, subsequent to Senator Coulter's question, subsequent to the additional information provided by Senator Richardson and subsequent to Senator Coulter's own press release on the subject, which I think was on 29 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, once we received that sort of information, I instructed my staff to inquire of the Department to have these allegations double-checked, following the honourable senator's question and press release. It was on the basis of that checking that I sent a senior official to that area on 1 June. I do not think any of that is contested by Senator Coulter or myself. I have directed my Department to inquire into if and why service officers did not properly respond to any earlier advice they may have received. I am also indicating that if that is the case disciplinary action will be taken. I also say for the sake of the Senate that when Senator Richardson gave his additional information he used the words `I am advised that'. Therefore, if that advice is misleading, it cannot be in any way attributed to my colleague.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, as soon as I became aware that information may have been given to Senator Coulter or the Senate in an incorrect way, I informed Senator Coulter, I think before Question Time on Monday, that information had arrived and that I would be sending him that information, which I subsequently did on Tuesday. I had it hand delivered to his office. I also convened a meeting of officials for 3 o'clock on Tuesday to go back over this material and to make sure that, if there had been one fault, there would not be a second fault. As Senator Coulter would know, I did not attend that meeting. I was in this chamber while there was a censure motion against my colleague. Nevertheless, my staff instructed those officials that, before we respond in the Senate, they are to double-check the information in order to make sure that there could be no further misleading of the Senate or misinformation given to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerning the third part of Senator Coulter's question, I do not know whether he has misinterpreted my letter. I have said that evidence exists that some trees were cut down. That is beyond doubt. I also have to say that there is no direct evidence that the Army cut down those trees, but I also acknowledge that the circumstantial evidence available to both Senator Coulter and me certainly points in that direction and further investigation will be carried out in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever happened in that exercise cannot excuse any environmental damage that might have been done during the exercise. I have directed that my departmental officers promptly carry out remedial works, undertake a full investigation of this episode and report to me and ensure that they fully cooperate with relevant parks and environmental authorities in the conduct of future exercises on Beecroft Peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the fourth part of Senator Coulter's question, I have requested an examination of the files with a view to tabling the documents requested by him. I must also point out that Beecroft Peninsula is first and foremost a defence gunnery range, an exercise area, the only one of its nature that exists in Australia. The fact that the vast majority of it remains in an unspoiled state is a testament to the normal, careful management and stewardship by Defence over the years. The fact that this area is there and available for public access and enjoyment when not required for defence activities compares most favourably to the situation in many other coastal areas. I add that most of the repair work that we carry out in the Jervis Bay area is not from defence bombardment but from that time when we open it up for eight months a year for others to come in and use it as a recreational resource.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I think the key part of the honourable senator's question which I would like to stress asks the reason why I am yet to put a correction to the Senate. It was in my own mind, and certainly in my staff's minds, whether we had been given the full story. If there has been misleading information given to the Senate, I am not going to compound that by providing other information that I am not fully satisfied with. When I have satisfied myself, I will make that statement in the Senate, correcting previous poor advice. I believe that I and certainly Senator Richardson have acted with total propriety in this matter. If the Senate has been misled by the incompetence of officials or if there has been any attempt to cover up this, the necessary action will be taken.</PARA>

That would be the end of the matter. I should at least say to the Senate that what is in contest here is whether Defence cut some new tracks and cut down some trees with a diameter of 20 centimetres or less-which it is entitled to do, incidentally, without reference to any other plan, provided the tree is less than 20 centimetres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real nub of the question is whether those who were involved in the exercise and those people at Jervis Bay provided correct advice to be passed on to Senator Richardson and, if not, why not?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government deplores the Israeli bombing raids into Lebanon which have taken place in recent days and which are reportedly among the heaviest in recent years. There have been three separate raids into Lebanon since Tuesday, 4 June by Israeli war planes. They have been directed against Palestinian bases in the vicinity of the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon. I have no firm information on the number of casualties so far, but it appears from reports that they include civilians as well as Palestinian guerillas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These operations coincide with the coming into force of the treaty of fraternity, cooperation and coordination between Lebanon and Syria. Israel opposes this treaty because it believes that the treaty will be a vehicle for the extension of Syrian influence in Lebanon. Whatever the possible provocation, the raids represent a serious violation of Lebanon's integrity and sovereignty. They will only serve to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East and could lead to retaliatory violence. The situation in southern Lebanon highlights the need for all parties involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict to exercise maximum restraint, particularly at this time as moves are under way to set in motion a peace process to resolve the dispute.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; That was such an idiotic interjection, Senator Knowles, that I was temporarily rendered speechless. I was briefed on this incident by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation yesterday. I think that what the investigation is revealing in this tragic event is that it is very foolish indeed to leap too quickly to judgment ever incidents involving aircraft. The investigation has been hampered to a very significant extent because the flight data recorder has been destroyed. The cockpit voice recorder has been recovered. The flight data recorder boxes are designed to withstand temperatures of 1200 degrees for up to half an hour, but clearly the post-crash fire exceeded these conditions and all the internal contents of the box have been reduced to ash. The cockpit voice recorder, however, which has been recovered has been analysed, but it still leaves many questions unanswered as to whether this tragic accident was caused by sabotage or related to a technical failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The investigating team, which comprises both Thai and United States officials, has just returned to the crash site. They will be there for at least the remainder of this week and have no easy communications at the site. I would also add that the investigating conditions are very difficult at the site. For example, just the other day to turn one of the engines over to recover an important part involved with the reverse thrust, an elephant had to be used to move the engine, so conditions at the site are very difficult. The team will return at the end of this week and further information will be gathered. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation is in constant touch with the investigating team and is being fully briefed on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The Boeing 767 aircraft which are used in Australia by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Qantas are of the same general type as the one that was lost, but the engines are different; they are of different manufacture and different models. If it comes to light-and it has not yet been established-that a malfunction in the reverse thrust mechanism was the cause of the accident, such an incident is not a potential problem here with the engine types that are used in Australia, because the control mechanisms used on these engines for reverse thrust are completely different.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. I ask him a question about integrity. Two and a half years ago the Minister in his role as Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories praised a Tasmanian Minister for having the courage and integrity to stand up and reveal to the Tasmanian Parliament that his Government had misled the public on a matter of fact over the Wesley Vale pulp mill. Does the Minister still maintain that in the face of denials, lies and deceptions, the courageous path, the path of integrity, is to speak up and tell the Parliament the truth, and if the Minister does not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister says that he has always told the Parliament the truth-I presume he also means that he has always told the truth outside the Parliament, in his ministerial capacity. Can he explain an answer he gave only yesterday on the John Laws program in which he was busy defending the integrity of Mr Keating, and did not reveal that he knew that his leader was deliberately misleading the public in order to win the spoils of office? So my supplementary question is in two parts. First, does the Minister always tell the truth in his ministerial capacity outside the Parliament or only in the Parliament, and the second part concerns the John Laws program.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to a report tabled at the National Health and Medical Research Council meeting in Brisbane today which states that about 5,000 Australian babies are born each year with genetically inherited disorders, and that the best way to diagnose or predict the disorders is to keep detailed registers of genetic information on affected people and their families. Is it a fact that the National Health and Medical Research Council is encouraging the establishment of national computer registers of persons and families with genetic disorders? Is it also a fact that the main purpose of these registers is not the cure of disorders but the prevention of the birth of babies with particular genetically inherited disorders, including by means of prenatal diagnosis and abortion? If that is the main purpose of the registers-that is to say, the detection of individuals deemed to have life unworthy of life-how are they to be distinguished from the national card index of persons with genetic taints established by the Nazi doctors under the Third Reich?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of a meeting of the National Health and Medical Research Council, or a committee of it, in Brisbane today dealing with the possible compilation of a register of genetic defects which may be handed on from generation to generation. Therefore, I am not in a position to answer Senator Harradine's question as to whether such a register is being proposed with the main purpose of facilitating diagnosis of a baby carrying such a defect within the womb and, therefore, presenting the woman bearing that child with an opportunity to make a decision as to whether to carry on the pregnancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am unable to answer the question, although I would say that surely in the Australian community there would be complete revulsion at the idea that the genetic practices of the Nazis might be reproduced in any form in Australian society. I am quite sure that the international medical ethics which were the result of the world's revulsion at those Nazi practices would provide sure guidance and criteria for the National Health and Medical Research Council in making any decision in this area.</PARA>

The reality has been that every time it has come to an election, the people have made their decisions on the Government's record and its proposals for the future. What will happen next time will be the same. I will give you some advice, Senator Vanstone, advice which maybe you should have taken before previous elections.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reminded of a speech that the former Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney, made about politics. I am sorry that I did not have the time to find the quote this morning but, basically, he said, `There is something inevitable about politics. When you are on one side of the House you run certain arguments and when you are on the other you run arguments that are totally opposite to the ones that you used to run before'. Senator Chaney was probably an expert in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is quite fair to indicate that the Prime Minister has already handled this question. If the Liberals are so concerned about truth in campaigning and if they are so concerned about undertakings to the electorate, they only have to look at their record consistently over a number of years in that regard. At this moment one is also reminded of the fact that in the current debate on political advertising a proposal which has been put up by the Australian Democrats has been given serious consideration by the Government. That proposal goes towards truth in advertising. Very soon we will be able to see what sort of hypocrisy or honesty those opposite have on this issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I refer to an article which appeared in the Australian of 5 June 1991 headed `Fast Train Project back on the Rails'. This article quotes Senator Button as saying that the issue of tax changes to promote private investment in large capital works projects is a `live one'. I ask the Minister: firstly, is the issue now more live because of the departure of the former Treasurer who opposed such tax concessions? Secondly, is it true that Mr Kerin is more sympathetic to the very fast train (VFT) project? Thirdly, who is the chair of the Cabinet subcommittee looking into the issue? Fourthly, is it now the Government's view that there is some discrimination in the tax laws against private investors in large scale projects?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I said to the journalists who asked those questions which led to the comments which appeared in the Australian was that the question of private sector participation in infrastructure development normally associated with government expenditure was being looked at and that there was some uncertainty. For example, there is a claim that the present tax structure does not discriminate against private sector participation in infrastructure development; others say that it does, and those two points of view are being examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The former Treasurer, Mr Keating, was, essentially, chairman of the subcommittee that is looking at that issue. I am quite unable to say whether the issue is more live as a result of the change in Treasurer. The purpose of the subcommittee was not solely a question of dealing with the problems of the VFT consortium; it was a broader inquiry. I have no idea what Mr Kerin's attitude is with regard to the VFT. I do not anticipate any change in the views of that subcommittee when they ultimately emerge. The views are not finalised yet and as soon as they are I will let the honourable senator know.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health and regards the concerns of the ACT-UP lobby on the subject of HIV-AIDS. Why does the Government consider that the personal importation scheme, where ill people must pay to import their own drugs from overseas because they are not available in Australia, enables fair and equitable access to lifesaving drugs when many people facing these illnesses are already seriously disadvantaged financially and on sickness benefits and invalid pensions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I answered a question somewhat along these lines from Senator Lees yesterday. I think what I was indicating was that the Government has, in contrast with many other overseas countries, tried to create a situation whereby those people suffering from HIV infection or full-blown AIDS are in fact shown compassion and given practical care by this community in a way which does not lead to their impoverishment. In fact, the whole Medicare system is a very firm foundation for enabling the treatment of persons suffering from the virus or AIDS in a way which does not burden them with those horrendous costs which is their fate in many other countries around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, I think what I indicated was that the therapeutic goods regulations have been altered to allow individual importation of treatments not registered in Australia provided they are prescribed by a medical practitioner. I believe this should be regarded as an advance on what was previously the case, although it is a fact that in some circumstances persons who bring in such medicines do have to pay the cost. As Senator Vallentine will know, we are certainly not attempting to be complacent or satisfied with the way in which drugs are evaluated, registered and permitted to be prescribed in a way which attracts a benefit here in Australia. Not only is the Dr Peter Baume inquiry being undertaken, but also I believe the Government is trying to ensure that, as far as possible, those who suffer from this terrible illness can get such treatment and drugs as they require.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that in Australia at the moment only one treatment is approved as acting specifically on the virus HIV. That treatment is of course approved in Australia with government subsidy. Once again, I contrast that with the situation in the United States where the drug is not available with a government subsidy. I believe that certainly indicates the attitude of the Government. I believe that other drugs may come onto the market and be given registration and approval, and the Government will then be in a position to consider the proper subsidy that might apply.</PARA>
<PARA> In general, the Government has endeavoured to undertake such changes as are necessary to the various regulations to ensure that either by way of a subsidy offered by the rest of the community in relation to approved drugs and medicines, or at least by permitting the import of certain other medicines and drugs from overseas, those who suffer from this illness are given an opportunity to have the treatment that they require in order to deal with this terrible disease.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Yesterday the Senate discussed my action in calling Senator McMullan in the debate on the motion by Senator Lewis to take note of an answer to a question given by Senator Button. I stated the basis of my action but undertook to refer the matter to the Procedure Committee. I have now further examined this matter. Standing order 186(2) provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Subject to the practices of the Senate relating to the call to speak, when two or more Senators rise together to speak, the President shall call upon the Senator who, in the President's opinion, first rose in the Senator's place. </PARA>
<PARA>The practices followed by the Chair in giving the call, based on past rulings of Presidents, were set out in a paper which was circulated by the then Deputy President with the approval of the President in November 1987. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall incorporate the paper in Hansard at the end of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> One of these practices is stated to be that, `Senators are usually called from each side of the chamber alternately'. This practice is modified in some circumstances. As I indicated yesterday, in calling Senator McMullan after Senator Button had spoken I was influenced by the fact that there had been five speakers in succession from the Opposition side of the chamber. As I also indicated yesterday, I was influenced by the fact that Senator McMullan, as a Parliamentary Secretary, acts for Ministers in the Senate and is regarded as the equivalent of a Minister for some purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> On reflection, I probably overstated the position yesterday in suggesting that a Parliamentary Secretary has the same procedural status as a Minister. Perhaps I should have given more weight to the fact that Senator McMullan was moving the closure and therefore potentially terminating the debate. But, as honourable senators will appreciate, giving the call is a split-second decision and there is sometimes not sufficient time properly to weigh all the competing factors in one's mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not consider that this statement requires debate again today because, as I indicated yesterday, I will refer the matter to the Procedure Committee. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a document headed `The Call to Speak in Debate'. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE CALL TO SPEAK IN DEBATE</PARA>
<PARA>Standing Order 186(2) provides:</PARA>
<PARA>``Subject to the practices of the Senate relating to the call to speak, when 2 or more Senators rise together to speak, the President shall call upon the Senator who, in the President's opinion, first rose in the Senator's place.''</PARA>
<PARA>In its application the standing order is governed by a number of practices giving certain Senators priority in the call. </PARA>
<PARA>Presidential rulings of the past have explicitly identified the following practices:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Senators are usually called from each side of the Chamber alternately. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The call is given to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate before other Senators. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) A minister in charge of a bill or other matter before the Senate is usually given the call before other Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>The following practices have also been followed:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) An Opposition Senator leading for the Opposition in relation to a bill or other matter before the Senate is usually given the call before other Senators. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Leaders of other non-government parties are usually given the call before other Senators, subject to the foregoing practices. </PARA>
<PARA> (f) Senators who have a right to the call under these practices are discouraged from exercising it if that would have the effect of closing the debate and other Senators wish to speak. </PARA>
<PARA>These practices should be regarded as being applied in the order indicated, so that each practice is subject to those that precede it in the list. If interpreted in this way, the various practices are consistent with each other.</PARA>
<PARA>In many debates an agreed speakers' list is compiled by the Whips and provided to the Chair, and Senators normally seek and receive the call in accordance with the list. The Standing Orders Committee in 1974 considered the status of this list and agreed that the list is ``unofficial and not a curb on the President, whose duty and privilege it [is] to say which Senator . . . [has] a prior right to speak'', and that the list could be used ``on the understanding that it is unofficial and must not be referred to in debate''. The Senate adopted the Committee's report. The list should also be regarded as subject to each of the practices listed above. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented. I have been informed that, during a division in this chamber yesterday when I was absent, several senators on the Opposition side raised questions about my whereabouts with implications of irresponsibility surrounding my absence. I am concerned that members of the public in the gallery at the time and possibly people listening on the radio might have been misled by the questions being raised in this manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I therefore wish to put on the record the fact that yesterday I was delivering a speech to the seventy-fifth anniversary conference of the Returned Services League in Melbourne, along with the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), representing the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-both of whom, I might add, travelled from Canberra to Melbourne and back in separate VIP flights, whereas I travelled on a regular commercial flight both ways. Those Opposition senators bleating about my absence, which occurred because of my responsibilities as Party Leader, were probably not aware that their Leader was also absent from the Parliament at a much higher cost to the taxpayer. I suggest that, if honourable senators want to raise those sorts of speculations, they should be raised privately rather than in that fashion. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Walters this day, relating to the leadership of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>This Senate has asked several Ministers in this chamber about their feelings on whether the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) should have told a lie and about the integrity of the Government generally. Let me go from the top to the bottom. Senator Button has said that it is quite all right to tell a lie as has Senator Robert Ray, Senator Richardson, Senator Bolkus and Senator Collins. Indeed, Senator Collins today said that the Opposition is being sanctimonious when we say we believe that there should be integrity and truth from Ministers. Senator Tate was the only Minister forced-and I stress the word `forced'-by Senator Lewis to finally admit that the ends do not justify the means. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister of this country has harangued us on many occasions. Indeed, Senator Baume pointed out 72 occasions on which the Prime Minister has talked of his integrity and the integrity of his Ministers. We have been told by the Prime Minister that no-one in this country would question his integrity; it was one of those lovely quotes. I have a few other quotes I would like to put on the record had I the time. I will just mention one. Mr Hawke said in 1983:</PARA>
<PARA>I remarked earlier on the right of the public to have confidence in the integrity of its elected representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Prime Minister should allow the public to have confidence in the integrity of the government of the day and particularly in the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> What has occurred? We have found that this Prime Minister, who talks so often about integrity, lied to the people in the most obscene fashion possible-during an election when he rebutted the Opposition claim that a vote for Hawke was a vote for Keating. He lied because several years before he had come to an agreement with the then Treasurer that he would pass over the reins of office to him. Indeed, this was done, each having his own witness-the Australian Council of Trade Unions leader and Sir Peter Abeles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister then went on a 60 Minutes program. Richard Carleton asked the Prime Minister whether he would be the Prime Minister for the next three years. Mr Hawke replied:</PARA>
<PARA>If they elect me on 24 March, which I hope they will, then the answer is an unequivocal yes.</PARA>
<PARA>Richard Carleton then turned to the Treasurer, who was sitting beside the Prime Minister, and asked whether he would be happy to hang around for that period of time. Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am happy to be led by the most successful Prime Minister in post war years. It is a pleasure for me. It has been matter of a great sense of accomplishment for all of us to have been in this Cabinet, and I am in a very happy ship. </PARA>
<PARA>This was said, both of them knowing that they had come to an agreement about handing over the leadership. We had the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) telling the Prime Minister that he would deliver the numbers `no matter how'. The Minister advised the Prime Minister to have an early Caucus meeting, to not stand down but demand to have a show of hands. It was good old trade union advice: `We will intimidate them and make them stand up and show their hands so that nobody can use their vote in a private fashion'. This Minister, one of the senior Ministers, advised the Prime Minister to go down that line. </PARA>
<PARA> When that failed, the Minister then said to Caucus members, `Fine. We will have our traditional vote, the show and tell vote, because the Right in Queensland has told its members they will lose their selection if they do not give the Prime Minister the vote'. What did Robert Ray do? He said, `We will have our usual show and tell'. So we had all the Caucus members showing and telling. Members of the Caucus had to show their neighbour that they voted according to the way the union-not the electors-outside this Parliament told them to vote. That is what this Government calls democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have in this Parliament the biggest trade union thugs that we have ever had from any other part of the country. They come straight into this Parliament from the trade union movement. They treat the Australian Labor Party-the Government-in the same way they treat their unions, and they get way with it on that side of the House. Senator Robert Ray, Senator Faulkner, and yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, are all straight from the trade union area. They all treat their various factions the same way as they treat their union membership. </PARA>

Therefore, Senator Walters has come into this chamber and told a deliberate mistruth. She has no information on this particular basis.

I would be an absolute hypocrite, having traded blows in this place.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make a few remarks on this report. I saw the draft of this report at the time of the Estimates committees. There are two things I want to say about it. First, the nature of the report has improved over the last year and I think that that probably has something to do with the fact that there is a new person in charge of light industry within the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC), a change which has taken place after many years of criticising the work of that Department with regard to the administration of the offsets program and partnerships for development program. </PARA>
<PARA> A read of the report itself-although it is improved in terms of the information-still leaves people such as I with great disquiet over the effectiveness of both of those programs, particularly in chapter 6, when dealing with the partnerships for development program, where one sees that the reports concerning the effectiveness of this program are always in global terms and there is no breakdown. So, one really does not know whether individual firms are truly performing, because the simple fact of the matter is that when a firm enters the program, when a firm enters a so-called partnership agreement with the Government, it has seven years in which to perform its obligations. Indeed, there is no requirement that it has to reach any particular benchmark on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reporting of the success or adjudged failure of progress being made by individual firms. Indeed, one could be forgiven for saying that the partnerships program was a very clever manoeuvre to allow some firms to get around the offsets obligation program. There is really no deterrent against breaching the partnership agreement. The real downside of the program is that, in order to do business with the Government in terms of selling information technology (IT), a firm really has to join the club, and that is the partnerships program, and this in fact adds to the cost of acquiring IT. When one realises that, in the last financial year, the total import bill for information technology into this country was $5.2 billion, the single largest import into this country, and one realises that despite the fact that we are a relatively small country we are the eighth largest market in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries for information technology, and that the lion's share of that market for private firms to sell to is the Government, one does really wonder whether or not we require to make the purchases that are in fact made. The matter of scrutiny is not adequate to see whether IT that is purchased is in fact used effectively. The whole paraphernalia of offsets and partnerships is just adding to the mystique and adding to costs. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting when in this chamber in the past day or two Senator Button announced that a new agreement had been entered into in the aerospace industry area, that in fact this is another mechanism which enables people to get around the offsets program, and when I interjected and said `Why don't you just scrap the programs?', I think one will find from a read of the Hansard that he thought that could be a good idea. So, in speaking to the report, I say that the report has certainly improved since the removal, or movement of Dr Fitzpatrick away from the light industries area but, at the same time, the programs themselves remain subject to strict scrutiny and indeed doubt as to their worthiness. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of Mr Enfield, on asbestos in the Department of Defence and affecting Defence personnel, is a valuable document. Inquiries have been carried out expeditiously. He was asked to carry out an inquiry in August and the report was given to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) in March this year. The asbestos hazard in the Department of Defence has been known for a long time. Indeed, action has been taken in recognition of that within the Department. The first action was taken as long ago as 1968. So, it cannot be said that the Department of Defence has ignored this serious problem. Fortunately, Mr Enfield has found that a relatively small number of Defence personnel have been affected by asbestos related illnesses. Nevertheless, it is clearly a responsibility of the Department to ensure that this is kept to a minimum. The Minister recognises that and he has stated that as the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me about the report, in the short time that I have had to look at it, relates to some of the conclusions that Mr Enfield has made in relation to Defence policy on this matter. He says that there has been a multitude of instructions relating to asbestos but that the instructions were inadequate and a new approach was needed. He said that there was no framework of policy for commanders and managers in Defence and instructions were produced in a variety of areas within the Department and services, leading to internal inconsistencies. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The instructions seemed to me to reflect the concerns of the originators rather than the needs of users. </PARA>
<PARA> He then gives examples of some of the inconsistencies that have appeared in instructions and he sets out his recommendations for a policy framework and the sort of instructions that should be given to commanders and managers. I am pleased to see the Minister has agreed and accepted a large number of Mr Enfield's recommendations dealing with training, identification of asbestos, development of management policies, medical counselling and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on this particular recommendation of policy framework, he says that this is being addressed by the Department as a high priority, and so it should be. I find it disturbing that no policy framework has been developed in the Department over a period of 23 years in which this subject has been recognised as a problem. The hit and miss approach that has been adopted reflects badly on the administration of the Department of Defence. It is by no means confined to this particular problem and it is certainly one that presents as a fundamental problem in the administration of defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Government will move, as the Minister says, as a high priority. I hope the Minister will have more success in improving the administration of the Department in this regard than has been achieved in other aspects of its administration. I am pleased that this matter has been attended to in this report and that these failings will be rectified in the Department as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I present the Committee's report entitled Report of a Visit to Papua New Guinea. This report is the result of a visit in February this year, undertaken by a working group selected from Committee members. The Committee consisted of some 10 members, although a lot more members of the overall Committee wanted to go on that visit, which indicates the great interest of both the Committee and the Australian Parliament in Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the visit was to study conditions and attitudes in Papua New Guinea as a background to our current inquiry into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. While parliamentary committees have no authority to gather official evidence outside Australian territory, and do not generally travel overseas in the course of inquiries, it was considered essential in this case to make an exception. </PARA>
<PARA> It was important to pay our neighbours the courtesy of considering the relationship from their point of view. More importantly, during the course of the visit it became obvious that we could learn a great deal about improving the relationship from our Papua New Guinean neighbours. We are therefore very grateful to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for personally intervening to ensure the Committee could make the visit and also to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for providing a Royal Australian Air Force plane. </PARA>
<PARA> While the visit was associated with a Committee inquiry, the report now being tabled is simply a report of the visit. It does not address the matters which are the subject of the inquiry itself. That report will be presented to the Parliament later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The visit took place over eight hectic days from 23 February to 1 March 1991. During this time we were privileged to hold discussions with the Acting Governor-General, with senior Cabinet Ministers including the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, with the premiers and cabinets of six provinces, with many of the leading citizens of the country and with many ordinary Papua New Guineans in the cities, towns and villages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wishes to place on record its thanks to all these people, who so generously gave their time, their hospitality and their ideas to help the working group to explore the many dimensions of the Australian-Papua New Guinean relationship. We would also like to thank the crew of the RAAF Hercules, who made the covering of large distances in a short time both possible and enjoyable. We thank the High Commissioner and his staff and the Speaker and Sergeant-at-Arms of the Papua New Guinea Parliament who contributed enormously to the success of the visit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not generally realised that PNG is the largest South Pacific nation after Australia, its population having recently surpassed that of New Zealand. Its known natural resources are enormous, and the discovery of new riches is a relatively common occurrence. PNG is also our nearest neighbour. What happens there affects Australia. But it is not mere geographic proximity which ties Australia to PNG and vice versa; the historical connections cannot be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been associated with the country since 1884, having ruled Papua as a Territory from 1906 and administered New Guinea from 1914. The formal relationship ended in 1975. On the evening of 15 September 1975 the Australian flag was lowered at the Sir Hubert Murray Stadium in Port Moresby. A Warrant Officer of the Pacific Islands Regiment presented it to Sir John Guise, Governor-General designate of PNG, who called on everybody to note, `We are lowering it, not tearing it down'. </PARA>
<PARA> The sentiment expressed then seems to live on. The working group was impressed with the obvious affection felt by so many Papua New Guineas for Australians-an affection that is returned by the many Australians who have lived and worked in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Nostalgia for the past is an important foundation stone of the current relationship, but it is not the cornerstone. Respect for the past should not blur the focus on the present and future. Our relationship is one which both sides need to work for-taking nothing for granted. In this regard we were greatly encouraged by the care with which the Papua New Guineans with whom we met had prepared for our visit. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the working group returned to Australia with vivid impressions of the variety and vitality of PNG. While it has many problems to overcome, it is difficult not to feel optimistic about its future. As chairman of the working group and Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I thoroughly enjoyed the visit. I have come away from PNG, despite all its problems, with a more optimistic feeling than expressed in some of the coverage PNG has received in the Australian media. It is unfortunate that there are some things that get sensationalised coverage in Australia which do not reflect the country's many achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is only of the visit of the working party. It in no way attempts to prejudge any of the recommendations that the Joint Committee will bring down in its report on the present inquiry. That report, which is anticipated to be tabled later this year, will be a substantial report. Already the Committee has put many hours and hours of work into the report in assessing many submissions and having public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> When the report is tabled it will be a benchmark for improving already good relations but even making them better with PNG. It will help many people in academia, the Australian community and PNG understand how our relationship can be improved. There is no doubt that when the report is tabled it will be greatly enhanced by the fact that 10 members of the Committee, and the secretary, Judy Middlebrook, had the opportunity to visit PNG for eight days. </PARA>
<PARA> Though it was unusual for the Committee to be able to send a working party to visit PNG, it will certainly enhance the credibility of the report. In future, both the Parliament and the Government should look at ensuring that, where inquiries are being conducted by standing committees of the Parliament with our near neighbours, despite the expense it is appropriate that members of those committees visit countries such as PNG to ensure that the report they table and finally come down with has the extra dimension of on hand experience. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to travel over the territory that has just been traversed by Senator Schacht, except to say that I agree with all the comments he made. There is great virtue in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade travelling to the countries that it is addressing in terms of a reference given to it by the Senate. I well remember the visit that a delegation made to the South Pacific when that was subject to a reference from this Parliament. Unfortunately, at the last minute I was unable to attend. I felt that there was a very real gulf, when it came to writing that report, between my working understanding of those nations and the understanding of those who had been on the trip. I felt a real sense of inadequacy in seeking to make a contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, I think there is something slightly obscene about this Parliament having a view, taking evidence and writing a report about our near neighbours but not, during the course of that deliberation, making a deliberate trip to the particular nation. I am sure that all who went on this delegation would agree that their knowledge was enhanced and their confidence that the report would reflect their understanding of the country and would be much more precise as a result of this visit was increased. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also true to say that there has been a paucity, in terms of visits and communications, between the Australian Parliament and the people of Papua New Guinea (PNG) in recent times. There is a temptation to overfly it on our way to more exotic destinations and that is not lost on PNG. We would be very unwise to take our relationship for granted. There is an enormous amount of intrinsic goodwill for us. It is our responsibility in all relationships to keep them in good repair. That could best be achieved by ensuring that there are regular visits between this Parliament and the Parliament of New Guinea. It is simply inadequate and unsatisfactory for it to be on a leader to leader basis, and it should not be party by party either. There really needs to be demonstrable interest shown by this Parliament in our northern neighbour. Papua New Guinea is one of the few countries where we can say that we do have a very special and almost unique relationship. Of course, it is the only country with which we are involved, as a colony, in some way. </PARA>
<PARA> There are all sorts of very good and natural reasons why we should maintain the goodwill and relationship that we presently have. Senator Schacht was quite right. From time to time, there is some adverse and unfortunate press in Australia in terms of events that take place in PNG. I feel that I came away recognising many of the problems but with a renewed sense of hope and optimism for that country, as well as recognising the very real advancement that it has made in the last 20 or 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on a parochial note by saying that the delegation was well and competently led by Senator Chris Schacht. We received excellent attention and dedicated commitment from Judy Middlebrook, who discharged her responsibilities with due care and goodwill. It is an accurate statement to reflect that the delegation worked well as a team, even though it was made up of a group of disparate people with varying attitudes and outlooks. We managed to get a refined and collective view about the events in PNG and, to an extent, our visit will help us all to write a majority report which will reflect the views of the whole committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend Judy Middlebrook, the then secretary of the foreign affairs subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, for writing this Report on a Visit to Papua New Guinea so well due to her diligent note taking during the journey. Apart from diligent note taking, she managed the visit extremely well and we owe our thanks to her. I endorse all the thanks in the report and those mentioned by Senators Crichton-Browne and Schacht just now, and I also especially mention those listed in sections 2.5 to 2.9 of the report itself. The vibrancy and generosity of the welcomes from the people of Papua New Guinea (PNG) wherever we went were quite remarkable. I am sure all the delegation will treasure those memories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This, of course, is only a short report of the visit and discussion should not pre-empt the findings of the Committee's considered report on Australia's relationship with PNG, which will be completed in a few months time. I would like to briefly comment on two aspects not covered in the report. As the report states, we were unable to visit the East Awin refugee camp, which would have been of great interest to us especially as a considerable amount of Australian aid has helped in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which was not even considered for the agenda, because of its extreme sensitivity, was Bougainville. Yet this was one of the most discussed issues of the visit. Everywhere we went, we were interested to hear people's views which were very wide-ranging on the subject of Bougainville. However, an Australian Council for Overseas Aid team recently went there and there was also a seminar on Bougainville at the Australian National University on 17 May. I want to mention a couple of points about the situation on Bougainville, some of which have further developed in the months since February when we were in PNG. </PARA>
<PARA> I am perturbed by the apparent failure of the PNG Government to fulfil its part of the agreement with the islanders, so they are still without fuel, medical supplies and things that they vitally need; and also the Australian Government's equal unwillingness to provide relief supplies until formally requested by the PNG Government. There have been plenty of discussions and requests, both at the ministerial and Australian High Commission level. But our Government-according to Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in a reply to a question from me the other day-is waiting for the full commitment of the PNG Government to the Honiara declaration and also for acceptance of it by Bougainvilleans as a pre-condition for Australian assistance. This is thus putting more hurdles in the way of immediate aid provision. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many meetings, as I have said, which have given strong indications of calls by some PNG ministers for help but it seems that the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is erring on the side of caution and waiting for a formally written request. For example, within a couple of days of the Honiara declaration, Sir Michael Somare at a news conference called for an Australian Hercules to fly straight into Bougainville with a load of medical supplies. But this has not happened yet. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not know exactly how many people have died in Bougainville during this crisis. Michael Ogio, the member of parliament for Bougainville North and who spoke in the PNG Parliament last month after 17 months of house arrest in Bougainville, estimates that 1,500 people died during the armed conflict in 1989 and early 1990, with another 3,000 dead as a result of the blockade. Some of the very ill population have gone over to the Solomon Islands for medical treatment and the hospital at Gizo is now desperately short of the necessary supplies and equipment to meet those needs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the women and children who suffer most. They are, of course, the least likely to have their voices heard in the all male PNG Parliament. As the only woman on the Australian delegation, I feel that this is very important to emphasise because it is always the women and children who suffer most in wars.</PARA>
<PARA> An article in the Weekend Australian on 1 June put it:</PARA>
<PARA> Bougainville's women are tired of ill-health and violence. They perform most of the work on the island, have been the victims of rape by both the PNGDF and BRA, and are denied a voice.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not surprised that, following a church service in Arawa, Catholic women gathered to sing for the reporter from the Australian John Lennon's song with revised lyrics. They sang: `Lord, we are praying, give peace a chance'. Yet we have the Australian Government not wanting to be seen to give any credibility to the Bougainvilleans' call for self-determination. On the one hand that is understandable in the political context of our relationship between the two countries, but on the other hand we willingly supply extra aid materials to the PNG defence forces, which have been responsible for some gross violations of human rights on the island. We do not seem to have such a sensitivity as far as that goes, or such a reluctance to be helpful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian relief team which recently visited Bougainville found that almost every family it visited had lost a relative to curable illnesses such as malaria, because medical supplies, facilities and access had virtually disappeared. All children born since the crisis remain unvaccinated against preventable diseases. I question why we are letting this happen on our doorstep. Bougainvilleans are Papua New Guinean citizens, too. We have an enduring responsibility to them which, given the emergency situation, should be very important and should stand aside from the very delicate political considerations. If we can give assistance to people in far away places on an emergency relief basis, I think that we ought also to be able to do it as far as the Bougainvilleans are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian relief team was a humanitarian mission. The Deputy Director of Australian Catholic Relief, Denis Tamplin, said that he hoped the group's reaction would spur the PNG Government to ship in more supplies and that the Australian Government's support for stepping up aid into Bougainville would be forthcoming immediately. I find it ironic that Australia can increase military aid from $19m to $50m in just two years without any hesitation virtually as a result of the Bougainville crisis but dallies over supplies that could save people's lives every day. </PARA>
<PARA> The blockade was officially lifted five months ago, so there is really no excuse for this continued delay. On the whole the PNG Government is subservient to the military. It is interesting to note the comments of the PNG Defence Minister, Benais Sabumei, in early May this year when he presented his annual report to the PNG Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that the Bougainville crisis was a blessing in disguise for the PNGDF where we have recognised our weaknesses and areas we should improve on. </PARA>
<PARA>Aid agencies are quite clear what the people of Bougainville need at this moment, so we hope that the Australian Government will get on, in advance of the considered report of the Committee about the relationship, and step up the humanitarian aid. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more positive note, another aspect of the visit which was not covered in the report due to its brevity was the excellent discussion with women's leaders which took place at the Australian High Commission, I think on the last day of our visit. The Commission staff looked after us extremely well in all respects during our visit there, and we thank them for that. This sort of a round table discussion with a women's group was a first for them, too. I am sure that it will not be the last. Unfortunately, not all of the Australian delegation was present, which was a great pity as it was a particularly illuminating couple of hours. Papua New Guinea is a very male dominated society and, quite frankly, we had hardly heard women's viewpoints until that meeting. Currently there is not one woman member in the PNG Parliament, and we did not meet any women representatives in the provincial governments either. Yet, interestingly, often the male expatriats would voluntarily comment on the strength of PNG women in holding the fabric of PNG society together. Their voices must be heard. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a group of well-educated women from various professions who informed us about a range of issues including bride price traditions, family planning programs and the domestic violence aspect of the law and order problem. It was a privilege to meet with this group, the only regret being that, because we were late for the meeting, it seemed very short. The PNG women realised the necessity to get to their homes before dark because of the security problems and we could not extend that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> I endorse the conclusions of the report wholeheartedly. It is very important to actively pursue close contact with our nearest neighbour. We have much to learn from each other. I agree with what Senator Crichton-Browne said on that point: we must not take this relationship for granted. I also agree with Senator Schacht that, despite PNG's many problems, the energy of its people left me, too, with a sense of optimism for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only just received a copy of the report on a visit to Papua New Guinea by certain members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I am not able to comment on the report, not having read it thoroughly, but I want to echo the views that have been expressed here today that Papua New Guinea is clearly our closest neighbour and the country with which we should have the closest relationship. The people of Papua New Guinea are people of great resourcefulness. I have had the pleasure of visiting Papua New Guinea on a number of occasions and, indeed, I was the only back-bench member of this Federal Parliament to be invited to the opening of the new Parliament House in Papua New Guinea some years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am somewhat perturbed about some views that have been around for a while and have been publicly expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in respect of population growth in Papua New Guinea. The Minister is on the record the other day as saying that we are getting concerned about the population growth in Papua New Guinea. We can see what he has done as a result. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau has diverted moneys that were going to an environmental program in the agricultural field to a United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) population program in Papua New Guinea which relies heavily on the controversial drug depo-provera. I sincerely hope that Senator Evans does not get concerned about the population growth in Tasmania, if there is such. I think it is quite disgraceful, frankly, to support a program which relies on a birth control drug which is not an approved indication in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had this out in the Estimates hearings and I do not want to labour the point, but I want to put the record straight-because the record was not put straight previously-and say that the UNFPA, with its associations with the drug companies, does not support a method which has been developed by Australian doctors John and Evelyn Billings, both of whom have received recognition for their services to the community, namely, the Billings ovulation method. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a readily accepted and understood method, particularly in rural areas. It is particularly understood by those who are illiterate, those who know how to recognise cycles. In trials done by a number of groups, including recent tests in Indonesia and India by international organisations which do not share my views, this method has come through with flying colours. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever we do so far as Papua New Guinea is concerned, we must respect the individual rights of the people of that country. We must respect their culture and not have this type of cultural imperialism as was inherent in the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that he is getting worried about the population growth in Papua New Guinea. I caution any group that might be considering a report on Papua New Guinea about that sort of attitude. I know that this is not the time to debate fully that question here today, but I merely raise it because I believe it is important that full consideration be given to the rights of individuals and families in Papua New Guinea and to uphold the dignity of their culture. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address briefly the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the examination of the National Crime Authority annual report for 1989-90. It is worth noting that this report covers a period before the present Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, commenced his work at the National Crime Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the view of the Committee, the report is a workmanlike document, with the exception of two matters-the name of a person who should not have been mentioned under the terms of the legislation which established the National Crime Authority and some incorrect figures. Both of these matters were dealt with constructively, expeditiously and without any fuss whatsoever by the National Crime Authority. I believe that this reflects the current situation at the Authority, which is proceeding in new directions, as outlined in a document prepared and published by the Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, entitled New Directions.</PARA>
<PARA> It may be an opportune moment to advert briefly to these `directions' and to put on record my reaction to them. In the document, Mr Justice Phillips states that the National Crime Authority will depart from its previous emphasis, which largely concentrated on drug trafficking, and take as a major long term concern serious white collar crime, which is currently on the ascendancy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> But, apart from such a broad reference and any specific ones that the Authority will deal with which will be not openended but will have a firm time line, the Authority also intends to adopt a different mode of operation and to place a lot more emphasis on partnership activities with particular reference to intelligence-sharing; to monitoring trends, particularly in the area of white collar crime; to law reform activities-in other words, advice to the Government where changes to legislation are indicated-and generally to a sharing of information in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of the latter attempt is the forthcoming conference in July called `Presentation of Complex Corporate Prosecutions to Juries'. In recognition that this mode of operation is not as easily monitored and assessed as work primarily directed towards obtaining convictions, the Authority is developing a corporate plan and performance criteria which will enable the Authority and the Committee to assess the work of the Authority and its performance. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to in any way pre-empt the current evaluation of the Authority's work which is being carried out by the Committee, but I would like to say that at a recent visit to the headquarters of the Authority by the Committee I was particularly impressed with the new spirit of active cooperation and the evidence that the dedicated staff are working enthusiastically under enlightened direction. I believe that the National Crime Authority has embarked on a positive path for its future work and its contribution to the detection of crime in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the luncheon adjournment I was documenting that the Government had not met its substantive undertaking to provide additional funds for renewable energy research, yet the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill that is now before the Senate is offering several hundred million dollars in incentives for exploration and development, and contains several provisions designed to enhance the concession offered to oil producers. This is despite the greenhouse effect that is threatening our climatic conditions and our environment, and the Government's professed commitment to the reduction of targets and emissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In assessing the current unsatisfactory state of research on renewable energy sources, the Australian Democrats felt that it was incumbent on the Senate to consider an amendment to ensure that the Government allocate out of the resource rent tax which is being raised by this legislation funds to promote the research and development of renewable resources. Accordingly, I moved at the legislation committee an amendment which would have provided $2m in the year ending 30 June 1991, $3.5m in the year ending 30 June 1992 and $5m per annum in each subsequent year. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that this proposal, modest as it is compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars which are being offered to oil exploration companies, would have been fastened on by the Government and by the Opposition parties with alacrity. Unfortunately, that was not the case. In the legislation committee both major parties decided not to support this amendment. I believe that it is an indication of the fact that both parties pay lip service to environmental and energy conservation measures, but are not prepared to follow through with even such a modest initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the other provisions of the Bill. The Bill first of all provides that a single petroleum project known as the Bass Strait project will exist in relation to all current and future production licences that are related to the exploration permit known as VIC/P1, which covers the Bass Strait area. This could have been achieved by using section 20 of the principal Act to combine all Bass Strait production licences. I wonder why that easy route was not taken. </PARA>
<PARA> However, more importantly, the Bill allows the transfer of exploration expenses from another project to be deducted against taxable profits from a producing oil field, thus severely reducing potentially the revenue derived from resource rent tax. The Government has already provided this type of assistance to industry in general by allowing the transfer of losses within a company group for income tax purposes-that happened in 1984-85-and more recently by the disgraceful decision in 1987 to re-introduce negative gearing on income producing properties. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal in this Bill is unique in our taxation law in that clause 19 of the Bill actually creates an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,000 for not claiming the appropriate amount of expenditure. However, the purpose is quite clearly evident. It is to prevent companies leaving funds to accumulate at an augmented bond rate plus 5 per cent, which is the new rate introduced by the Bill. It is a measure that is welcome because previously the augmentation rate of 15 per cent allowed oil producers to collect returns on the banked up entitlements at the compounding rate of up to 28 per cent. This underlines the oil companies' talents to maximise their returns. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I refer briefly to the Australian Automobile Association's recent statement in which it pointed to the fact that the oil companies are pocketing some $30m in excise collected on behalf of the Federal Government by using the temperature variation when petrol is dispensed at the bowser. The legislation provides that excise is paid at a certain temperature at 15 per cent. However, if companies sell at, say, 20 per cent they can make an annual saving of $30m. I say this in passing to indicate that the oil companies are not slow to look after their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the amendment that the Australian Democrats moved in the legislation committee to deal with this situation. We believe that there is no reason to provide incentives to oil exploration companies at the expense of Australian taxpayers. Therefore, we have sought to remove those provisions in the Bill which enable companies to claim tax deductibility for oil exploration expenses on a company basis. That means that even beyond the Bass Strait principal project, they are able to deduct oil exploration expenses in any offshore area in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument is put that this is necessary to ensure that oil companies will carry out exploration in marginal areas and will unlock marginal oilfields. However, when we look at the number of exploration wells drilled in Australia between 1986 and 1990, we find that activity has not been declining. We find that in 1986 offshore drilling was concerned with 28 wells, in 1989 with 39 wells and in 1990 with 64 wells. Therefore, it can hardly be suggested that we need to incite petroleum companies to engage in further exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to ensure that Australia looks to the long term future and develops alternative renewable energy sources. As I have already documented, both the Opposition and the Government have rejected an amendment that would have made that possible. They have also rejected the amendment which gives the oil exploration companies over two years a figure in excess of $700m, although that particular figure is being questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant by-product of imposing this resource rent tax is the effect on the price of methane and ethane available to both commercial and domestic consumers in Victoria. The Government announced that compensation will be paid to Victoria in respect of forgone royalty receipts, and a further amount of $60m will be payable in two annual instalments of $30m each, which the second reading speech tells us will minimise any transitional pressure on gas prices.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the increase in prices, which would potentially affect manufacturers and domestic gas users in Victoria, is of the order of $60m. A higher figure of $90m has been floated, but there seems to be general agreement on $60m, which means that the compensation that the Government has offered is barely half the increased costs that Victorian manufacturers, employers and private gas users are expected to bear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have received representations, as have the other parties, from the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Victorian Gas Users Group and the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria; individual firms such as Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd and Australian Cement Ltd; and companies such as Chemplex and Altona Petrochemical Co. Ltd which use ethane to manufacture plastic resins. We have also had a submission from the Australian Chemical Industry Council. The Australian Democrats believe that these submissions should have been taken seriously by all the parties. However, it fell to us to move an amendment which would have made it impossible for the gas producers to pass on the additional cost. Had the amendment been successful, it would also have provided Commonwealth revenue with a windfall of $30m which, I am sure, in the current climate would have been welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that a resource rent tax should be paid by the producers rather than passed on to consumers. Accordingly, the Australian Democrats moved an amendment to produce just that result, by defining the tax as an income tax-a term which is used in the contractual documents-and preventing producers passing it on. However, once again, both the Opposition and the Government decided that they did not really care about Victorian gas users and Victorian employers or the workers who are employed in those enterprises. This amendment also was not passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The position adopted by both old parties on this Bill shows, quite clearly, where they stand on a number of issues: the concern that they profess to have for people and manufacturers that are hit by the current economic recession, the environment and energy conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government will say, `We cannot upset the equilibrium of this Bill. It is finely tuned. It has counter balances with concessions to business and reductions in the augmented bond rate that businesses are able to claim on banked up exploration expenses'. That may well be true, but it should not prevent the Senate from changing the direction of legislation which is clearly misshapen, misplaced, and misdirected. </PARA>
<PARA> The other argument that I expect the Minister to bring up is that piecemeal reform of this type, through individual amendments, is not something that the Government will engage in. </PARA>

The net result of that delay is that for almost a year we have put an impediment in the way of using recycled plastics. The same applies to an amendment to remove sales tax from wheelchairs and other equipment used by disabled people. Once again, we were told that individual amendments are not something that the Government would care to engage in. The net result is that disabled people have been suffering. It is the same with this Bill. Individual amendments combine to create a direction for legislation which, in this particular case, is misconceived.

The threshold rate for carrying forward the undeducted capital project or development expenditure is to be reduced from the long term bond rate plus 15 per cent that existed in the earlier legislation that was enacted in the late 1980s, which had limited application and which this legislation now extends to include Bass Strait-for what is known as the development expenditure, as opposed to the exploration component of the expenditure-to the long term bond rate, plus 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this 5 per cent added to the long term bond rate does not cover the cost of capital. That is an immediate signal that the Government does not want to encourage this sort of investment. If the Government is not prepared to put in place a proper RRT regime which acknowledges the need for an adequate return on the cost of capital, this legislation is either flawed or the Government does not want to encourage gas and oil exploration offshore. It is as simple as that. Furthermore, the Government denies an appropriate deduction regime to those operators and producers exploring and developing offshore in Australia because it fails to provide the full deductibility of all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> While all the parties agree that some changes to the secondary taxation regime in Bass Strait are necessary, the Opposition parties have expressed some misgivings in relation to the legislation before us. That concern extends very widely in the State of Victoria to industries which will be particularly hit by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the resource rent tax, the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA), amongst others, has had concerns and, after all, it must be one of the foremost authorities. It acknowledges that these amendments will improve the legislation to the extent that some allowance will be made for failed exploration-one of the small pluses of this legislation; also, the decision to allow wider deductibility for exploration expenditure will remove a fundamental flaw in the design of the PRRT regime which has impeded exploration in relation to the unexplored frontier areas; but it skews the legislation in terms of the two principal players in Bass Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the players has quite a large exploration program offshore, the other, in earlier times, in accordance with government legislation and initiatives, went onshore. Consequently, much of this tax will be skewed against one of the principal producers, namely Esso Australia Ltd. However, APEA remains concerned, as do so many others, that this legislation is basically flawed, for other reasons. Its concerns are also the concerns of others within industry who will feel the real impact of the RRT tax-some industries will be wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought it was contrary to the environmental philosophy of the Government for it to impose taxes on an industry that is basically non-polluting, because that will provide a greater impetus to the use of coal and other resources. I remind the Senate that, where Australia has this tremendous comparative advantage in natural resources, its economy would benefit from a better balance between the development of resources on the one hand and downstream processing, including other manufacturing and service industries, on the other. This is the important point-and I notice that the press are more interested in talking about social activities than in this fundamental point that could affect the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments must therefore be very conscious of the need to set secondary taxes so as to avoid this loss of comparative advantage in the secondary and tertiary sectors. I remind the Senate-and this was picked up in the minority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration-that the inappropriate design of the resource rent legislation could have an effect in two ways: if producers of a resource are able to pass on the tax to processors, a bias may be created in favour of the export of raw materials rather than their further processing in Australia; if the tax can be passed on to the users of this resource, the cost structure of export and import competing industries outside the resource sector will be increased, thereby reducing their international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of matters associated with this Bill were announced in the explanatory memorandum but have not been included in this legislation. The first matter concerns the payment of $60m in the form of compensation to the Victorian State Government over the financial years 1990-91 and 1991-92. The former Treasurer, Mr Keating, in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has . . . decided to provide the Victorian Government with a special grant of $30m for each of the first two years of application of resource rent tax to minimise any transitional pressures on gas prices. </PARA>
<PARA>He implied the right to pass on. The transitional pressures to which he refers are the loss of income from offshore royalties from Bass Strait, which are currently shared with Victoria, and the increased tax, and thus the cost of gas as a result of that resource rent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the granting of any compensation to Victoria was a last minute political solution to an intractable problem. This was evidenced by the fact that reference to the compensation was not made in the Bill itself and it was certainly very evident from the concerns of the witnesses who were present at the Committee hearing last week. The Opposition sought, by amendment, to ensure that these funds were directed to the users on an equitable basis. But on the occasion of the Committee hearing the amendment was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters which seem to have been dealt with in the second reading speech but are not in the legislation itself include the announcement by the former Treasurer regarding the treatment of resource rent tax payments under income tax law. The former Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Under existing provisions RRT is deductible for income tax purposes only after the final assessment has been made. The Government has decided that instalments of RRT should be deductible for income tax purposes in the income tax year in which they are paid. This change, which will apply to payments of instalments made on or after 1 July 1991, is consistent with general principle that an income tax deduction should arise when a payment is made. </PARA>
<PARA>This is particularly important when one considers that many of the principal players affected by this legislation need to self-assess their taxation liabilities by the financial year ended 28 May and pay the tax within 28 days of that date. It is just not good enough that we do not have complementary income tax legislation which will enable that deduction to take place and that change of regime to be effected. So I ask the Government to confirm when it intends to introduce the necessary amendment into income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to proposed new section 24A, this Bill will extend the petroleum resource rent tax to Bass Strait production of all petroleum, including natural gas, liquid petroleum gas and ethane. Previously these products were subject only to royalty at 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent of revenue net of allowable costs. They have never been subject to excise. It has been suggested that the RRT, if imposed at 40 per cent on revenue net of cash operating capital costs, will increase the level of secondary tax on these products by an estimated 200 per cent to 300 per cent. This will be even higher if one considers the non-allowable costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that it is not a 40 per cent tax regime in terms of an RRT; it is considerably higher because of the non-allowable proportions and as a result of the form of application. As any mathematician will say, it is effectively a percentage rate equivalent to the mid-sixties. Before the relevant Victorian Minister was placated by the $60m worth of compensation he made a statement to the Victorian Legislative Council on 29 November last year:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Federal Government introduces a resource rent tax in the autumn session of 1991 it will have the impact of increasing costs in real terms by 8 per cent for large industrial consumers and 5 per cent for domestic consumers. It will also have the impact of increasing costs by between one and 2 per cent for the State Electricity Commission consumers because of the purchase of natural gas by the SEC. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, we had the curious situation of provisional invoices being introduced in Victoria for large and small recipients of gas. These recipients were advised that their invoices were provisional and subject to the passage of this legislation. Subsequent to the compensation offer, the same Victorian Minister is on record as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>There should be no gas charge increase as a result of the RRT legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>But who will pay for this inevitable increase which has been estimated at anywhere between $50m and $80m per year? The Government's $30m compensation per year will not cover it and will not cover all users. I think we have had confirmation to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources, Mr Alan Griffiths, in his statement to the APEA Annual Conference on 9 May 1991 stated that Victorian consumers would not pay more for their natural gas as a result of this legislation. This statement was made to the peak body. This statement by Mr Griffiths reiterated his earlier comments made on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio in February that:</PARA>
<PARA>If there is any attempt to pass on these gas prices to, in particular, industrial users in Victoria, then those people can assume that they are being treated unfairly. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever his plan, 80 per cent of the gas is sold to the Gas and Fuel Corporation on long term contracts which allow the passing on of the RRT to consumers. Naturally, this is of great concern to Victorian gas consumers-be they companies or individuals. I have great concern for companies, particularly those in the ethane industry, which have these sorts of long term contracts and will be caught in this price cost squeeze in an environment of reduced tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the concerns raised by Victorian manufacturers is higher industrial gas prices seriously disadvantaging Victorian manufacturers against interstate and overseas goods and reducing the potential to export goods. Their concern is certainly justified on the basis that the RRT creates an inequality between Gippsland-produced gas and other onshore or North West Shelf gas fields. The North West Shelf gas is transhipped to Japan and people there will not suffer a resource rent tax. Why? Because they have long term contracts which make that area marginal and to put a tax on the oil field in the North West Shelf might interfere with the viability of the gas field. They are not so worried about the Bass Strait, though. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation for ethane is much the same as for gas. Ethane produced from Bass Strait is a major raw material for Victoria's petrochemical industry-an important industry for that State. The industry produces plastic resins which are sold at prices determined by import competition. With historic and future tariff declines, these prices are falling. An increase in secondary tax on ethane cannot, therefore, be passed on to the consumer and must be absorbed collectively by the producers of ethane, ethylene and polyethylene-the petrochemical chain. </PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of this secondary tax is discriminatory against the petrochemical industry versus competing products-I cannot understand it-and an arbitrary impost of $10m to $15m a year on the struggling Victorian petrochemical industry. Ironically, as I said previously, that coincides with tariff cuts. It is recognised that the replacement of excise royalties with the RRT will in the near future reduce the Government's secondary taxes on oil production-however, not by nearly the amount that the Government claims. Investment decisions on gas production, ethane extraction and petrochemical plastics productions are independent of oil production economics, and the cost structure of this chain has to compete in the world market. The Government's secondary taxes are effectively destroying downstream industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The RRT on ethane represents something like one per cent of the Government's revenue from the RRT Bill. As such, the ethane issue is not a fundraising issue in principle. Thus, those in the Victorian petrochemical industry would argue that the proposed secondary tax increase on ethane should be eliminated from the Bill. The Government is not prepared to acknowledge that. An alternative to elimination is that the petroleum resource rent tax on gas and ethane be made financially equivalent to a royalty so that equity for the producers can be restored and the price rises can be avoided. We would not object to that procedure. I understand that a specific proposal to achieve this has been put to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the pressure of time, I now move to clause 19, which involves a broadening of exploration deductibility provisions. The coalition and the industry welcome the amendment to broaden the exploration deductibility provisions. The allowable exploration deductions will be amended by this Bill from being limited to a particular project to being company-wide. Again, that is a plus for the legislation. It is a significant reform which will tend to encourage exploration in frontier areas, since companies with revenue streams from successful ventures will be able immediately to reduce their RRT liability by offsetting exploration expenditure in any offshore area against their revenue. That is a key feature of a good RRT regime. But I fail to reconcile this measure with the Government's reluctance to provide an adequate add-on to the long term bond rate to provide an adequate cost of capital return in a risky enterprise. The stock exchange investors demand a higher return in terms of these sorts of enterprises than they do, for example, for a retail operation in central Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The key word here is `offshore', because these broadened deduction criteria applies only to offshore operations. The two operators in Bass Strait are Esso and the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP). BHP has more offshore operations than does Esso; thus it is advantaged more by this amendment than is Esso, whose operations tend to be onshore. I suppose that it is the Government's intention to try to encourage Esso to move more offshore. That is fine, but the Government will not do that if it does not provide an adequate return on capital or if it does not allow full deductibility of costs, even in terms of Esso's offshore operations. A further point in clause 18 concerning allowable expenditure is that all expenditure prior to 1 July 1990 will be deemed to have been deducted. That is an extraordinary situation. It raises a problem for more recently established oil sites, which I will discuss in just a moment, time permitting. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that the Government has not recognised exploration-related environmental costs in the definition of exploration costs. Environmental costs fall within the definition of general project expenditure and therefore are not considered a valid deduction under exploration expenditure. As there is an increasing amount of environmental expenditure being required specifically for exploration these days, it seems incongruous that this is excluded. I hope that Senator Coulter takes up this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The application date for the amendments proposed by this Bill is 1 July 1990. This raises the issue of retrospectivity. While generally opposed to retrospective taxation measures, the coalition will not object, although we believe that this legislation should have been debated 12 months ago. Having RRT apply from 1 July 1990 is possibly the lesser evil. The other option would be for it to apply from the date of the announcement or perhaps from the date of the implementation. In both instances, the Bass Strait producers would suffer a significant loss versus the royalty excise arrangements. The coalition has as an objective the reduction of excessive oil taxation on Bass Strait, and to alter the commencement date and impose additional costs on the industry would be contrary to that objective. But how Victorian gas and ethane producers will recoup their costs retrospectively is a problem for the Federal Government and for the State Government to sort out jointly. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned a few moments ago that there was a problem with declaring recent investments as fully deducted from 1 July 1990. The problem is that this overturns the agreed basis on which investments in recent developments were undertaken and, in the case of Esso, severely handicaps the company as a result. Esso's case is important. I do not generally go into particular issues involving particular firms, but this case is so discriminatory that it must be raised in this Parliament. A commitment was made to five new oilfields following the 1987 excise negotiations on the understanding that the first 30 million barrels of production from each field would be exempt from excise. The excise exempt quota of 30 million barrels was designed to permit development of small reserves which might be uneconomic if subject to excise. </PARA>
<PARA> Based on those negotiations with the Government, the investment by Esso in those fields to date has been $567m. The expected excise-exempt quota for the field was about 82.9 million barrels. The production to 30 June 1990-that is, until the RRT regime came into play-was only 21 million barrels-about a quarter of the expected exempt amount. How discriminatory. Therefore, for equity reasons it has been suggested that unrecovered investment in this case should be deductible in accordance with the philosophy of the resource rent tax. The suggestion is that a proportion of investment related to the unproduced excise-exempt quota for each project should be deductible for the purposes of the RRT. I believe that this is a matter in which the Government should give consideration to a later amendment in the spring session of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> While on this topic of allowable deductions, I also wish to mention the problem that the current legislation does not allow what might be termed as private royalties as a deduction for the purpose of calculating RRT. This royalty in the case of the Gippsland field is very much at arms length. It is not in-house, in-company or anything else like that. Under the terms of a 1961 agreement, a royalty is payable to Oil Basins Ltd (OBL) on the value of all Bass Strait production. There are three arguments why the OBL royalty is a legitimate business cost to producers-but denied under this legislation-and should be deductible for the purposes of assessing RRT. The first of those reasons is that the Government stated in its December 1983 discussion paper on RRT that `override royalties can be said to be a legitimate deduction for RRT purposes'. That is another statement which has been overridden. </PARA>
<PARA> The OBL royalty is recognised as a legitimate business cost for income tax purposes, but not for RRT purposes. How inconsistent; how discriminatory. As a longstanding commitment, OBL is clearly not a loophole. That is the argument that the Government uses. Perhaps we could put `any future royalties', but an existing allowable deduction recognised as being at arm's length certainly should be an allowable deduction for RRT purposes. To the extent that the RRT is not deductible, unlike excise, there will be a windfall gain to OBL and an unjustifiable loss to the producers. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to clause 14, a further area of concern relates to the threshold rate for carrying forward undeducted general project, or development expenditure, being reduced from the long term bond rate plus 15 per cent, and the same as for exploration expenditure, to the long term bond rate plus 5 percentage points. In terms of exploration, people do not invest if they do not think they will get an adequate return on the development once they have found that oil; it just does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the important point concerns the cost of capital. In any RRT regime, governments must be cognisant of allowing a return in excess of the cost of capital, not below it. The failure to provide such a return on investment will result in the deployment of resources to the less riskier investment and thereby discourage exploration and development, contrary to what this country really needs. In fact, APEA, the peak body, submitted that the carry forward rates did not cover the cost of capital and provide an adequate rate of return. The reduction in the development rate could adversely affect the impact on gas projects, since these are characterised by limited profitability with long operating times and high development costs. It would also appear that perhaps the Government is willing to encourage the exploration of potential oil sites but is not encouraging their development to the production stage. </PARA>
<PARA> A further problem arising from the threshold rate changes is the so-called five-year rule. However, expenditure incurred more than five years prior to the issue of a licence can only be compounded forward at the rate equal to the gross domestic product deflator-again, a disincentive factor built in. This rule is completely inconsistent with the RRT philosophy. We are using the RRT philosophy but not applying it in its proper form. We are applying it for the benefit of revenue to the Government to the detriment of downstream processors and the producers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my greatest concerns is the effect that secondary taxation will have on both the Victorian economy and the Australian economy generally. In practice, it is possible to satisfy all the desirable criteria for a system of resource royalty. The best that can be achieved is to minimise the disadvantages. I have highlighted some of the disadvantages which I believe exist under the resource rent tax as per this Bill. Hopefully, as a result of what is a very significant and important committee process, for which I thank the Minister for his patience, those disadvantages will be minimised. Through this Bill, I ask the Government to look at the issues that have been raised in that committee stage debate very forcefully and with a great deal of feeling, acknowledge the matters that have been raised here by the industry and pass subsequent amendments at an early opportunity to minimise the disadvantages that will be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Opposition's ability to change substantially this legislation has been hindered by the fact that it is a Budget and revenue Bill with significant revenue implications. We are a party of principle. We do not intend to walk away from our responsibility in that area. It was indeed a difficult decision, knowing the suffering and the harm that will be caused to many people and many industries in Australia. The legislation is badly flawed. We ask the Government to implement legislation at an early opportunity to overcome the flaws and recognise the need for income tax legislation to support this RRT Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating in the second reading stage three cognate Bills. The first is the so-called Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. I point out that it does not involve a resource rent at all; it is misnamed. I will pick up that point later. The other two Bills are the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 1991 and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will pick up the second Bill first, which is the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill, because what I want to say later on is very critical of the Government. In relation to the second Bill, I want to give some credit to the Government for passing a very useful and very good piece of legislation from an environmental point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill seeks to do several things which have the strong endorsement of the Australian Democrats. It seeks, for instance, among other things, to require the holders of offshore petroleum titles to lodge securities with mandatory requirements for title holders to take out insurance against potential liabilities arising from their operations. At present, that requirement is not mandatory and this replacement should ensure that adequate insurance is in place should something like a major oil spill occur in the marine environment, such as the Exxon Valdez disaster or something like that, for which the costs are absolutely astronomical. Appropriately, those who explore for and those who exploit oil in the marine environment should carry adequate insurance to pick up the costs to ensure that the environmental clean-up costs are fully met by the operators and their insurers and not picked up by the Government through public taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, this Bill seeks to further protect the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in that a number of inactive permits which have been inactive, as we were told in the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), since 1971 will be rescinded. I believe that that further protects the Great Barrier Reef in that it removes once and for all the potential threat which hung over the park as long as the permits to explore for and exploit oil on the Great Barrier Reef were in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill links in with another piece of legislation, which we will be dealing with shortly, which seeks to ensure that ships passing through the channel on the inner side of the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef will be piloted. I notice in that legislation that currently some 200 ships per year go through that area without a pilot. Some of those ships could be carrying oil or toxic chemicals and, in the event of an accident, could cause very significant damage. I congratulate and warmly support the Government for that piece of legislation and also the other legislation which we will be dealing with perhaps the week after next. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the principal piece of legislation, the so-called resource rent tax legislation. This is not a resource rent tax because a resource rent tax would be just that-it would be a rent which is paid for the exploitation of a resource, specifically a non-renewable resource or a renewable resource which was being exploited beyond the rate at which it could be sustained. To pick up Senator Watson's words, the philosophy which should lie behind such a piece of legislation would ensure two things: that, in the case of a non-renewable resource which is being exploited beyond the level of sustainability, the extent or the rate at which that resource is being exploited will be reduced by the imposition of the tax-in other words, positive discouragement of over exploitation; and that the exploitation would be brought back to a point where the use of that renewable resource is sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of a non-renewable resource, any exploitation of that resource is not sustainable because, by its very definition, it will run out. So the resource rent tax on the amount actually taken out of the ground or exploited in that case seeks to do several things. It seeks to provide a fund from which alternatives to that non-renewable resource can be developed. So when that non-renewable resource runs out eventually, our descendants are not left without a replacement. The imposition of a tax and the reduction in the use of that resource at present will also pick up the issue of intergenerational equity. In other words, it will cause the public in the present generation to pay something for the use of that resource, which will be denied to future generations if it is no longer available or if, through its depletion, it becomes a great deal more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pick up several things that the Opposition said in its minority report to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, to illustrate the point. In their report, Opposition members said that the principle underlying the tax is that it should be a return to the public from those who develop non-renewable, natural resources. There is nothing wrong with that, except that the public also includes-and this is apparent to those of us who are alive to these things-future generations who may lay claim to the use of that resource. So, the question of intergenerational equity is clearly not picked up in what the Opposition is saying. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition also say that the tax should not be passed on to the public, to the consumers. It is precisely because the tax is passed on to consumers that they will alter their behaviour because of the increase in price. They will use less of the resource and, therefore, will leave more of the resource for future generations, and the use of the resource will move closer towards a balance between this generation and later generations, while at the same time the tax which is levied against the current use of that resource can be used to research alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The interests of future generations are also picked up by a proper resource rent tax which, as I have indicated, this is not. This is not a tax that is levied on the amount of petroleum, gas or ethane which comes out of the ground, by barrels or trillions of cubic feet but it is a tax that is levied against profits. It is simply a tax, like any other tax. Should there be no profits in the exploration or exploitation, there will be no tax. So there will be no impact in relation to the environmental considerations, which a proper resource rent tax should have. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, members of the Opposition also talk about its effect on downstream industries, and this was also picked up in Senator Watson's speech. As far as I am aware, in the petroleum industry taken as a whole, there are only two products that are not burnt. One is ethane, which is turned into a range of petrochemicals, particularly plastics, which Senator Watson mentioned, and of course there are the heavy fractions that are left over-the bitumen that finishes up on roads. As far as I am aware, every other fraction is burnt and there is no downstream processing. Senator Watson rather disingenuously said that the petroleum industry causes no pollution. Of course, the petroleum industry, precisely because its products are burnt, is one of the significant polluters. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the point I wish to pick up now in criticising more trenchantly this legislation brought forward by the Government. As I said the other day, this Government is looking backwards. It is putting in place legislation which addresses the problems of yesterday rather than those of today and tomorrow. I shall provide a few figures as a basis for what I want to say further. There is no doubt, and it is widely accepted, that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are rapidly increasing, and the rate itself is increasing. The best scientific opinion at the present time says that that will have very significant effects on every single aspect of human activity and that while at present there is no unequivocal evidence that we are already in a greenhouse situation, by early next century that evidence will become unequivocal. </PARA>
<PARA> The likelihood, then, is that politically and socially there will be wide acceptance of the need to make drastic reductions in every single carbon-based fuel. That includes coal, to pick up Senator Watson's point, but also hydrocarbons. There will have to be drastic reductions in their use only 10 to 15 years from now. Certainly by then-as there should be now-there will be a wide acceptance of the need for that drastic reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose of this legislation is to encourage further exploration for petroleum-the petroleum that is causing the major global environmental damage at the present time. I simply pose the question: is it wise to put in place legislation to encourage the discovery of more of a resource which, from all the indicators, we will be using less of in the very near future, with that lessened use being widely accepted by the community?</PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech, the Minister said that the measure is to encourage:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the producers to efficiently drain the Bass Strait province in a manner which has greater regard to the producers' capacity to pay . . .</PARA>
<PARA> The resource rent tax is based on achieved profits rather than production levels . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He correctly identifies that it is not a resource rent tax at all. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA> The current disincentive to explore in frontier areas will, therefore, be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is not basically designed to achieve the objectives that I outlined before: to address the problem of inter-generational equity, to reduce the amount of the resource actually used, and to move the money that is raised from the resource rent tax into the discovery of alternatives so that when the resource runs out the next generation and later generations will have available to them alternative technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Minister, it is to overcome the current disincentive to explore in frontier areas. So, further hydrocarbons will be discovered and, of course, the implication is that they will then be used. But as I have indicated, I believe that to be a misreading of the future. Again, it is an indication that this Government is not looking forward. It is not looking at where we are now and at the environmental consequences of what it is doing. It is simply looking at an economic situation without reference to the environment and is addressing past problems rather than future problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some of the points made by Senator Watson in relation to costs, which also have a bearing on this. Senator Watson has said that the figures are wrong; they may well be wrong, but that is not my point. According to the Minister, there will be a cost to revenue of $305m in 1990-91 and $450m in 1991-92 and that later on an improvement is expected, with a positive return to revenue. I see Senator Watson is nodding. The figures may be wrong, but the point I want to make is quite simple-and I am glad that the House is saving some energy while I am speaking, Mr Acting Deputy President, by turning off the lights; it is something I have been asking them to do for quite a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures indicate that this is not a measure that will have a positive benefit to Government revenue in the first couple of years-accepting those figures for the moment-with the positive benefit expected later on. However, that will be closer to the time when the evidence in relation to the greenhouse effect and the need to cut back drastically on our use of this resource will be less uncertain and more positive. Therefore, it is more likely that people will accept the measures that will lead to a reduction in the resource. My concern is that a large amount of revenue will have been inappropriately spent in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Spindler said that in an earlier Bill of this kind the Australian Democrats sought and achieved an undertaking from this Government that as little as $5m would be set aside from an earlier fund of this type to be spent on renewable energy. Senator Spindler also mentioned that in the first year after the creation of that fund, an increased amount of money was spent for that purpose but that subsequently, not only with respect to that fund was the money not spent but also on what were then National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council funds generally, there was a progressive and disastrous run-down in the money this Government was spending on renewable energy research. </PARA>
<PARA> If a resource rent tax is to meet the proper criterion of reducing, and I stress `reducing', the use of a non-renewable resource, there must be an increase in the costs passed on to the consumer so that a price signal is given within the market mechanism which will reduce the use of that resource, encourage its efficient use and, at the same time, create the fund which will be used to research the alternatives for that non-renewable resource when that non-renewable resource runs out because we have a responsibility to later generations. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not here simply to use up non-renewable resources profligately and leave nothing behind. If we are going to use non-renewable resources at all then we have a responsibility to put in place the alternatives which later generations can use for their energy needs. This Bill is not designed to achieve that. This Bill is not a resource rent tax; it is simply a general tax on profits of a particular kind and it is wrong to call it a resource rent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are committed to resource rent taxes. To the extent that the Opposition talks about a consumption tax, it would have our support if a consumption tax were a tax levied against the non-renewable component of consumption if that became the principal source of Australia's revenue. It is ridiculous to impose a consumption tax which is also a tax against the labour component of goods and services. Rather than opposing a resource rent tax, we are strongly in favour of a resource rent tax. A major portion of the Government's revenue should ultimately be raised in that way. If passed on that would eventually become a consumption tax but a very specific type of consumption tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Government's legislation to widen the application of a resource rent tax on offshore oil and gas developments. This is an important package of legislative measures, with considerable significance to the petroleum and exploration industries. The legislation will have a major impact on Victoria and could well have serious consequences for Victorian industry and the wider community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government argues that the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill and cognate Bills will lead to the recovery of a further 200 to 300 million barrels of oil from Bass Strait over the longer term. It expects that gas production will, in the longer term, be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways, this legislation highlights the great uncertainty afflicting our industries as a result of Government policies. Like other sectors of the economy, mining, exploration and secondary processing industries have been greatly harmed by the Government's economic policies, which have led to record high interest rates, an overvalued dollar and the worst recession in 60 years.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there have been extra burdens laid on this vital sector of the economy by the Government's confused and often inconsistent environmental policies. On top of these massive problems the Government is now imposing a new tax regime-the consequences of which have not been clearly established-particularly on downstream user industries. </PARA>
<PARA> It was fortunate that the Senate had in place the comparatively new procedure of referring Bills to committee. These important and complex Bills were rushed through the House of Representatives on 16 May under the Government's guillotine, which allowed only 90 minutes of debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, chaired by Senator Coates, provided an appropriate forum for witnesses, both supportive and opposed to aspects of the Bill, and enabled their views to be heard. In addition to the oil and gas producers, all the major gas users were represented before the Committee. Their views and those of Ministers and officials could be tested and evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say the evidence put before the Committee indicated that, despite the claims by the Government, clearly inadequate consultation was carried out by the Government with the major end-users of Bass Strait gas and ethane. In particular, it appears no prior consultations were held with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time a number of the companies involved in this industry were provided, through their representatives, with an appropriate forum to bring to the Parliament, their concerns about the Government's resource rent tax (RRT). A diversity of views was put to the Senate Committee. BHP Petroleum pointed out that it had committed very large resources based on the understanding that the RRT would come into effect on 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> While BHP put to the Committee that there were deficiencies in the RRT legislation, Mr McCammon, the General Manager for BHP Petroleum, believed that it would, without a doubt, lead to increased exploration and production around Australia. Esso Australia Ltd pointed out that the RRT had to commence from 1 July 1990 but it opposed a number of other aspects of the legislation, including the increased tax on natural gas and ethane. The Victorian Gas Users Group and Australian Chamber of Manufactures indicated a range of problems relating to the legislation that they felt could have a particularly savage effect on Victorian industry. Their submission to the Committee pointed to the possible increase in the price of gas to the Victorian manufacturers. They argued, among other things, that the proposed resource rent tax legislation, as it applies to natural gas and ethane, will not achieve the Government's objectives. Australian Cement Ltd, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association Ltd (APEA), APM, Chemplex Australia Ltd and Altona Petrochemical Co. Ltd all brought their various concerns to the attention of various members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time I have available, I want to concentrate on one of the major concerns about this legislation-the effect that the application of RRT on natural gas and ethane could have on prices paid by end-users. On 9 April in a major speech at a conference, the Hon. Alan Griffiths, Minister for Resources, argued that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government also has been consulting very widely on the issue of potential effects of RRT on gas costs in Victoria. The consultations are nearing conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The final arrangements on natural gas pricing are primarily a matter for the Victorian Government and Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA>Most importantly, he concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>However, as a result of these consultations, I am confident that any impact on gas prices from RRT will be minimal and that Victorian industry will not be disrupted by the RRT initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>This confirmed the earlier assurances that Minister Griffiths gave to Mr Jim Plowman, shadow Minister for energy and minerals in Victoria, in a February radio debate on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that there was no reason why any manufacturer should be disadvantaged. On this occasion, Mr Griffiths said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if there is any attempt to pass on these gas prices to, in particular, industrial users in Victoria, then those people can assume they are being treated unfairly. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I am quietly confident that Esso and BHP will not be passing on the gas prices in the way that might have been indicated. </PARA>
<PARA>During these hearings, Senator McMullan on behalf of the Minister did not resile from any of these statements. In relation to the ethane sector, Senator McMullan in the Committee hearings said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is our view that there is ample capacity in the surplus generated by Esso and BHP in ethane production from Bass Strait to absorb the RRT factor. Those companies are conscious and will remain conscious of the market consequences of further price increases. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating-the Government's failed Treasurer-in his second reading speech on this Bill indicated that the Government would be providing the Victorian Government with a special grant of $30m for each of the first two years of application of the RRT to minimise any transitional pressures on gas prices. There was some concern among people appearing before the Committee about whether this money would be appropriately applied for the purposes for which it was granted. The coalition, as signalled by Senator Short, will move an amendment to ensure that the Victorian Government gives effect to the Commonwealth's intention. </PARA>
<PARA> While there is some debate on the actual cost effect of the RRT, this package, depending on whether the industry's or the Government's estimates are accepted, represents between one-third and one-half of the cost impact of the RRT on natural gas. The estimates given to the Committee ranged from $60m to $90m a year. It is clear from Senator McMullan's comments that both the Victorian Government and the producers are also expected to play a role in absorbing any additional cost pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan made it clear in his statements to the Committee that the Victorian Government should also absorb part of the cost increase from RRT over and above the $30m provided by the Commonwealth. Possibly Senator McMullan had in mind that the Victorian Government's take from natural gas through the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria from its public accounts committee and public authority dividends rose from $92m in the last year of the Thompson Government in Victoria to over $320m today in real terms; that is, in the eight years between 1982 and 1990 during the term of the Cain and Kirner Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that the Government expects that producers, particularly in the short term, will be in a position to help absorb some of the costs involved in the application of RRT to natural gas and ethane. The Commonwealth Government argues that it is losing $750m in revenue over two years as a result of the RRT legislation. Mr Keating, in his second reading speech on this Bill, argued that the producers had secured a windfall benefit in the early years of the new arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies, however, pointed out that the actual benefit to them would be substantially less than this figure. They certainly do not share the same confidence as the Government in their capacity to help absorb some of the additional costs of RRT on natural gas and ethane. However, BHP said that the company is committed to long term development and marketing of gas resources. A spokesman for the company made the important statement that `it would not jeopardise this position for short term advantage'. Mr McCammon went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Pass-on of RRT is a matter of commercial negotiation under the terms of our contracts but these negotiations would take into account where our customers are currently paying fair value for gas. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the Government sees absorption of the costs of RRT on natural gas and ethane to be shared by the Commonwealth Government, Victorian Government and producers in a way which will minimise costs to end-users. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Victorian Government and producers, at least publicly, are not prepared to give any assurances. That can be judged from the quotations that I made from BHP. This is quite rightly causing a high degree of nervousness amongst end-users. In fact, witnesses before the Committee gave forecasts of possible price increases which could result from the RRT, and this evidence was outlined by Senator Watson in his speech in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short has outlined why the coalition is not prepared to accept the Democrats' amendment relating to tax liability. Instead, the coalition has proposed an alternative course which will not interfere with contractual obligations and which will not absolve the Victorian Government from playing its role in meeting at least some of the additional costs of RRT. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy of the Australian Democrats knows no bounds. One of the amendments that they put before the Committee would have imposed heavier costs on producers by limiting the deductibility for exploration expenditures. Senator Spindler has put forward in this chamber a long list of tax increases in the Democrats alternative budget, including increased petrol excises, higher company taxes and so on. The Democrats have supported extremist environmental actions which, among other things, if successful could effectively stop exploration activities for minerals, including natural gas. I think this was actually confirmed in another way in Senator Coulter's speech. </PARA>
<PARA> All these Democrat policies would impose higher costs on Victorian industries and consumers. Senator Spindler knows that his amendment could not be accepted because of the precedent it sets for tax policies. As I have mentioned, Senator Short has set out in his speech on this Bill our views on that particular amendment. Let me just add one point: with the Spindler precedent, governments could determine whether any taxes, such as fuel tax, excises, royalties and so on, should or should not be passed on to the consumer. I suggest it is a precedent that no company would really want opened up in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Senator Spindler and his colleagues are not the slightest bit concerned about cutting costs to consumers. The Democrats' tax policies, as set out in their alternative Budget and other statements, are an invitation to the Government to bring in a new range of taxes to hit productive industries and consumers. I regret that the amendment Senator Spindler moved was just another cynical Democrat stunt. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the Australian Democrats, the coalition has moved a constructive amendment which should give some comfort to end users. As a result of the coalition's amendment, the full impact of the legislation will be assessed in two years time to see whether it has been successful in meeting its objectives. Bearing in mind the Government's view that the impact of RRT on gas prices will be minimal, our amendment will require the Government to report to the Parliament and indicate whether this objective has been met. I might say that the Government, to its credit, has indicated that it will agree to this amendment in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Bill has unintended consequences which are adverse to Victorian industry because the Government's expectations have not been met-and we remember the promises of Alan Griffiths which I quoted earlier-I believe that action can then be taken. The Government expects this Bill to provide stability and a more certain framework for long term planning by the industry. I do not share this Government's confidence. Regrettably, this Bill will impose heavier taxes in the long term on resource development in this country, and I think that can only have the effect in the end of providing less resource development and higher costs to end users. The report required by the Opposition's amendment to this Bill will allow a proper parliamentary assessment of the consequences of this hastily enacted legislation to ensure that its benefits are not greatly outweighed by its costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 has been very well debated by my colleagues Senator Short, Senator Watson and Senator Kemp, who have all elaborated very well on our position. The Bill, in essence, extends the petroleum resource rent tax (RRT) to Bass Strait oil and gas from 1 July 1990 and terminates from that date the excise and royalties scheme currently applying to Bass Strait production. I must say that, in line with much of what the Government is presenting by way of legislation, this Bill has had a chequered career and a much delayed start which, frankly, I believe is quite ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government were unable to get legislation in the appropriate form, taking into consideration the impact it would have, why did it bother to include it in the consideration of the 1990 Budget? Why this Government never seems to do its homework is beyond me, but some of the goings-on that we have seen over the past week in this place may be the cause of the problem with some of the legislation that has been drafted. The Bill has been fiddled with since it was first announced in the Budget. It was pushed through the House of Representatives under guillotine and the final draft version has been available for only about seven days, which does not make scrutiny very easy. As the shadow Minister for energy and resources said earlier, so much for legislation by careful discernment and consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> This country's mineral resources, like agriculture, are valuable and vital commodities. They generate enormous wealth and are responsible for our high standard of living. It is therefore somewhat indicative of the decline of the Government that a Bill as complex as this, on issues as vital as ones which affect a major section of the economy, ought to be debated first in the other place under the threat of the guillotine and then come to this place flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a Budget Bill, although one could be excused for asking for which year. Obviously, on that basis alone, the Opposition would not oppose it. But one has to question the standards of the Government in taking so long to frame legislation, to present a final draft only seven days before it gets pushed through the other place and still have major concerns expressed about it by a Senate committee when it arrives here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of complex proposals and I do not propose to canvass the issues that other speakers, as I have already said, have covered perfectly adequately. However, I would like to raise one or two points about the legislation. The question of the starting date of the five-year rule is one issue that arose from consideration by a Senate standing committee. The five-year rule reduces the amount of exploration expenditure that a company can carry forward to be offset against revenue and hence RRT liability. </PARA>
<PARA> The oil industry, naturally, has argued that the starting date for the rule should be the date of application for a production licence rather than the date of issue. We can understand the oil companies wanting to ensure any additional revenue and tax relief that they can find. For companies involved in oil exploration in this country, it has not been easy to understand and interpret the changes to the rules attached to exploration in this country. Successive governments have made considerable moneys from Bass Strait oil over the years, but they have also been willing to change the game plan when it suits them. In the past that has made it difficult for oil companies to plan future investments. In respect of Bass Strait, the oil companies will need to review their plans in light of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to continue to provide incentives for exploration, as I think Senator Kemp and Senator Watson elucidated in an eloquent fashion in this debate some time ago, and we need to be careful in legislation such as we have in front of us today that we provide industry with the right incentives and the right assurances that we will not keep changing the rules. Concerns have already been raised in respect of ethane users with the potential for a retrospective tax being applied as a result of this legislation. The Government appears to have either ignored or forgotten about the effects on ethane producers and, more particularly, the ethane users. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator Kemp and Senator Short, both from Victoria, have the interests of their State at heart and I know that my National Party colleagues in the other place have expressed concern at what would have happened about the natural gas prices as a consequence of the Bill. The Government has announced a $60m package to ease the transition, but it has not yet included that in this legislation. Given the parlous state of the Victorian economy, I also want to express concern as to what guarantees we will have that the Victorian Government will, indeed, use this grant of $30m a year-$60 over two years-appropriately. I am advised that $60m is only half the expected cost and it is hoped that the Victorian Government and the oil companies will absorb the rest. I can only say that the Federal Government has great expectations if it thinks that the Victorian Government will be able to give anybody anything, although I note that the Victorian Government already takes a good slug out of gas sales through its so-called public authority contribution, which is a State tax on gas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has also suggested a phase in or additional transitional arrangements for ethane because ethane has been excluded from the $60m package. These are but two issues that the Federal Government has ignored or not been aware of in the drafting, but the Bill was introduced into the other place by the ex-Treasurer, Mr Keating, whose ideas have been flawed on many economic issues over many years in this country. In fact, the former Treasurer of this country has driven this country to the brink of bankruptcy. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us look at some of the issues that came out of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In the evidence given, it was suggested that the Bill was poorly drafted and that there was no consultation at all with gas users in the lead-up to the decision. People who sat in at the meeting said that it was very clear that the Government had given no consideration to the impact of the decision on downstream gas users in Victoria, particularly the industrial users. Of course, the $60m compensation package designed to cover only half of the costs to which I have already alluded was also raised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its wisdom-and particularly in the wisdom of those who made the dissenting report: Senator Campbell, Senator Kemp and Senator Watson-looked at all these concerns. It is a great pity that the minority report was not the majority report because it has summed up the issues in this Bill which are of concern. I am not going to hold the Senate up any longer because we have a lot of legislation to go on with. I believe that the case has been very well put on behalf of the Opposition by the previous Opposition speakers in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish by saying that I naturally support the Opposition proposals that the Government report to this Parliament in September 1992 on what effects the legislation is having on prices and on the industry. If we are going to slam our resource industries in this country to the extent that they are not going to look for further discoveries and that they are not going to have the money or the will to look for further discoveries because they are taxed out of existence, taxed in an incorrect way or the rules are changed too many times, we are going to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that in the future the Government consults a little more with the industry before it changes the rules. If it does not, this country will be what we all were told it was going to be some years ago by the ex-Treasurer of this country, Mr Keating, who has caused so many problems--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill is very important. I think it justifies the seriousness with which it is being debated by the Senate. It is a Bill of fundamental importance to the Australian petroleum production industry. The reforms in the Bill will increase production in Bass Strait and broaden Australia's petroleum exploration effort. I have been a little surprised to hear some of the views expressed, which seem to fly in the face of both the predictable outcome of such legislation and the actual outcome of the announcement of the legislation in the 1990 Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already indicated this in the committee stage, but let me put it on the record here: the Government will accept the amendment put by the Opposition in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that requires the Government to report to Parliament by 30 November 1992 on the operation of the legislation. There was never a problem from our point of view with providing a report. At some stage we were apprehensive about the nature of the amendment as originally proposed, and we thought that perhaps the idea of putting in such a report would generate some of that uncertainty which several speakers have been concerned about, but I think we now have a form of words that is acceptable to everybody and that will meet the interests of the Opposition without causing any potential problems; so we accept that amendment. I am not sure that we would have sought to initiate such an amendment, but we are not unhappy about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go on to talk to one other amendment, which was not proceeded with but about which I gave some assurances in the Committee, and I reiterate those here. There were concerns raised in connection with the production licence application process and I am prepared, on the behalf of the Government, to give an undertaking or an assurance that that process will be covered by this report. More specifically, the Government will carefully monitor the administration of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act to ensure that the period between the application and issue of production licences is minimised and will include in its report the time between the application for and the date of issue of licences. Those are the explicit things about which people sought assurances; they are reasonable, and I reiterate them here. </PARA>
<PARA> I also indicated in the Committee that it is not my intention that the report should duplicate the report required of the Tax Commissioner under section 16 of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987. The Act requires certain other reports, and obviously we will seek to minimise duplication in some manner or other. In those two matters, I think we now have a satisfactory and agreed outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to express serious concern about the Opposition's persistence with the second amendment-in fact, the only outstanding matter now, the one concerning the attempt to put in the legislation a provision that purports to ensure that the Commonwealth's $60m is spent in the way intended. Obviously, we do not disagree with the fact that that must happen, and I am happy patiently to explain again why there are better mechanisms to ensure that this will happen, mechanisms which will be undertaken. I am prepared to give that assurance here. The difference between what we will do and what the Opposition is seeking to do is that what we will do will work and what the Opposition is seeking to do will not work. It will not achieve the purpose. I think it is bad principle and bad practice and, as usual with such things, it will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the amendment relating to the grant to minimise transitional pressures on gas prices will not be agreed to by the Government. The grant is not directly related to the resource rent tax (RRT). I have been surprised that some people have expressed concern that the money is not referred to in this legislation. Of course, it is not. It will be appropriated in the Budget. Any attempts to ensure that Victoria use the grant for its intended purpose will not be effected by referring to the grant in the legislation. I cannot see how anybody can conceive that the amendment as drafted will achieve the purpose for which it is intended. Given that Opposition senators can read, I cannot believe that it is other than an attempt to try to prove to people that they have done something when it is unnecessary to do so and when it will be ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth decision to pay $30m to Victoria in each of the next two financial years is an explicit public commitment. Gas consumers will be aware of the arrangements, and we will be scrutinising their accounts accordingly. The Victorian Government also will be mindful of the explicit public commitment. The Victorian Government has assured the Commonwealth that the grant will be fully passed on to minimise any potential effect of RRT. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment will be made through an appropriation to be brought before the Parliament in the Budget session. The safeguards provided by the standard provision of the appropriation process more directly and-if I can say this somewhat more forcefully-more appropriately deal with the concerns raised by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the way in which the Commonwealth Government ensures that money it appropriates to go to the States is spent in the manner intended through the standard process of appropriation. Let me clarify that. For example, page 156 of Budget Paper No. 2 for the 1990-91 Budget-and this is standard; the same process will apply this year-deals with appropriations for payments to the States, which is the exact issue we are now debating. Section 5 of the Appropriation Act deals with payments to the States. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Payments that are made to a State for a purpose specified must be made:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) on such terms and conditions, if any, as are from time to time determined in writing for the purposes of the Appropriation Acts by the Minister specified. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the standard mechanism, it has worked and it has had its full force on each occasion that it has been used and, contrary to this silly amendment, it will achieve its purpose. The Government is on public record-and I will put it on record again-that the $60m is being provided to the Victorian Government to minimise any transitional pressures on gas. The payment to Victoria will be made on the condition that the $60m is to be used to minimise any transitional pressure. That condition will be enforced. The Opposition has the Government's assurance that such a condition will be stipulated in the exchange of letters which will occur, as is normal for the special one-off appropriation to the States. </PARA>

<PARA> I suppose the clearest example of the fact that we need to do it in a manner other than that which Senator Watson specifies is that, even if he carries this amendment, it is my view, which I think is the correct one, that we will still have to undertake the exchange of correspondence arising out of the Appropriation Bill. We will achieve the purpose in spite of Senator Watson, but it seems that we are littering the Bill with unnecessary, counterproductive matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Watson carries it, he will be littering the Act with unnecessary and counterproductive sections, which can only do one of two things. They will create a false impression that a purpose has been achieved which has not in fact been achieved; or they will confuse and make more complex the interpretation and understanding of the legislation. Senator Watson has a longstanding and proper concern about the proper nature of the legislative process. It may not be shared by his colleague sitting behind him, Senator Kemp, who has not yet understood the point. But Senator Watson is correct in the way in which he pursues these matters in general. If we amend the Bill in such manner as this, it is entirely inappropriate, it is bad practice and the Government will not accept the amendment. The amendment is extraordinarily ill-advised and inappropriate. The best thing that can be said for it is that it probably does not do much harm; it does absolutely no good.</PARA></TALK.START>

The only way in which Senator Kemp is consistent is that he lowers the level of anything he touches. I address myself to his colleagues who have participated in the debate usefully and constructively, even though on this matter I disagree with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been some concern-and if it were well-founded it would be proper concern-that the tax regime that is being introduced may lead to a reduction in investment. People have been saying that the companies will not invest under this regime. The fact is that it is because the companies are confident that this regime will be introduced that they have been investing. Major investments have been made because people are convinced that this is the appropriate mechanism for the taxation of these sorts of projects, and that investment will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Everybody else having been reasonably concise in their contributions to this debate, I do not want to make too lengthy a contribution. I will try to respond to some of the explicit points which Senator Watson raised more particularly about investment, and if I get time I will do so. I would like to turn to some of the points that honourable senators made in the debate. I have already dealt with several of the points raised by Senator Short which related explicitly to the amendments. I will come back to them, if I can. Senator Watson raised a concern about--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cost of capital.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the point about the cost of capital, but Senator Watson also asked about the 30 million barrel excise exemption. With regard to all these matters-I said this before the legislation committee-we are dealing with a balanced package of measures. I understand that we are entitled to disagree as to whether the balance has been appropriately struck, but when one tries to excise any one of the elements of a package and analyses it in isolation, one often achieves a false impression of the fairness and the nature of the balance. There are a whole series of checks, balances and offsets in this package which make the net result, we think, fair and reasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that the producers have argued that the imposition of RRT on revenues from small reserves developed in Bass Strait on the basis of the 30 million barrel excise concession given in 1987 is a problem for them. Our view is that in terms of the balance of the package the impact of the RRT on the investments which no longer will be excise-exempt has to be balanced against the likely producer gains from the lower effective tax rate applicable in the first two years of RRT. In addition, Bass Strait producers will benefit from company-wide exploration deductibility, which will permit the deductibility of any offshore exploration in RRT areas against Bass Strait RRT liability. </PARA>
<PARA> We can argue about whether the balance is right, and Senator Watson is entitled to his view. I said in a philosophical moment in the legislation committee that one of the great difficulties of any proponents of change is to prove that certain adverse consequences will not happen. It is only after the event that one can establish that certain things did happen and sometimes, more to the pity, it is proved that one is wrong. That has happened. People raise concerns and say that A, B, C or X concern may occur if one makes changes. One can only say on the balance of evidence, `We think that we have struck the appropriate balance'. The responses to date tend to reinforce that view. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody in this chamber will be surprised that certain of the people likely to be affected by the tax would like to change the balance so that the tax is less. Perhaps the least surprising representation any of us ever receive is a representation from a group of taxpayers saying, `Please make a change to the law so we don't have to pay so much tax'. That is not the world's most surprising submission. Those people came before the Committee and made those submissions and Senator Watson has taken up that point. I do not share their view; I think the balance is more fairly struck. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson raised his concern in respect of the cost of capital. Essentially, this comes under the same heading as how we judge the balance of return. The carry forward rate for undeducted expenditures and the RRT rate operate together to ensure that the industry obtains a fair return on its investment. The carry forward rate maintains the real value of funds invested and include a risk premium. The tax rate of 40 per cent generally extracts less than full economic rent. If the carry forward rate were to be adjusted upwards, a compensating rise in the tax rate would need to be considered. In other words, we have struck a lower rate than otherwise might be struck because of the changes that are being made in the carry forward rate. If we were to change the carry forward rate, we would want to make consequential changes to the 40 per cent rate at which the tax has been struck. </PARA>
<PARA> I reinforce that point by saying that Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) knew last August that the carry forward rate was the long term bond rate plus 5 per cent-it was mentioned in the Budget last August. Since that time, there has been a substantial exploration program based on the understanding that the RRT would come into effect. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd indicated to the Committee that--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was really committed before August though. An exploration program is planned over a long period of years. That was committed under the old regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Watson thinks that BHP, having made a decision, is incapable of changing it if it found it to be uneconomic, he has less faith in its judgment and competence than I do; BHP is well aware of the circumstances. Senator Watson is putting a very strange argument-that somehow or other a company which makes a decision inexorably drifts on with other decisions because `they are unprofitable now, but we made them a while ago'. People have accused BHP of being a bit bureaucratised but I would not have thought they would accuse it of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate the point by saying that BHP has spent $66m in RRT areas in the belief that offshore exploration will attract wider deductibility from that date. It has entered into major commitments since July last year totalling up to $90m for new acreage in the Upwey and Duntroon basins, and has placed bids for acreage elsewhere in Australia. In other words, BHP has gone on with previously planned exploration encouraged by the deductibility arrangements and has entered into new and major commitments, so I have to tell Senator Watson that I think that concern is ill-founded. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been concern about when the Government will change the Income Tax Act flowing from this. I expect that to take place in the Budget session. I have made a number of comments about amendments because I want to minimise the committee stage debate if I can. I think we all have that view; we have all used the second reading stage in the same manner, and I understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, this package is important in the national interest. It will significantly enhance the efficiency of the tax regime for the petroleum industry and it will encourage more exploration in a manner that is required and appropriate. The indications are that the understanding that the legislation is to come into effect is already having that desirable effect, and it is important that it should continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The least surprising bit of information that came out before the Committee, which seems to have been seized upon by some people with enthusiasm, is that the instrumentalities of the Victorian Government, BHP and Esso would not give commitments in advance that they would absorb all of these costs. It seems to me highly unlikely that anybody about to enter into a commercial negotiation would come before a Senate committee and say to the party with whom it is about to negotiate, `Don't bother, don't worry, we'll absorb all these costs for you. There is nothing to worry about'. I have to say that although I thought the indications from BHP, in particular, were encouraging and the sort of sign which I would expect, and the commitment from the Victorian Government is appropriate and one on which we will insist when the appropriation is made, to place great store on the fact that no such prior commitment has been made seems to me to be a little unrealistic, to put it politely. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the fact that honourable senators, for a variety of reasons and with a range of misgivings, will be supporting this legislation. I welcome that because this is an important package in the overall program of the Government both in budgetary terms and in setting the framework for this industry. I appreciate that support and I look forward to the committee stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek the leave of the Committee, having previously obtained the assent of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), to incorporate in Hansard the minority report of Senator Campbell, Senator Kemp and Senator Watson on the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and associated Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MINORITY REPORT</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal National Parties' concern</PARA>
<PARA>Conceptually, a resource rent tax (RRT) should not be passed on to users. The principle underlying the tax is that it should be a return to the public from those who develop non-renewable natural resources. The evidence before the Committee suggests that the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill may breach this principle to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA>If a flow on of resource rent tax were to occur in this case, it could work against the further development of downstream processing of natural resources in Australia. This would be a particularly unfortunate result. </PARA>
<PARA>It is widely accepted that, while Australia has a comparative advantage in natural resources, its economy would benefit from a better balance between development of resources on the one hand and downstream processing, other manufacturing and service industries on the other. Governments must be conscious of the need to set secondary taxes so as to avoid loss of competitive advantage in the secondary and tertiary sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>Inappropriate design of resource rent tax legislation could have such an effect in two ways. If producers of a resource are able to pass on the tax to processors, a bias may be created in favour of the export of raw materials rather than their further processing within Australia. If the tax can be passed on to users of the resource, the cost structure of export and import-competing industries outside the resource sector will be increased, reducing their international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>The Coalition is concerned that these effects could occur to some degree as a result of the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Cost of Capital</PARA>
<PARA>In the establishment of an RRT regime governments must be cognisant of allowing a return in excess of the cost of capital. Failure to provide such a return on investment will result in the deployment of resources to less riskier investments and thereby discourage exploration and development. </PARA>
<PARA>APEA submitted that the carry forward rates did not cover the cost of capital and provide an adequate rate of return commensurate with the rates involved in the circumstances of limited deductibility of costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Natural Gas</PARA>
<PARA>Bass Strait natural gas is sold to two major Victorian Government instrumentalities, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) and the Gas and Fuel Corporation. Representatives of the producers told the Committee that their contracts with these bodies would permit the pass on of RRT on natural gas and that they proposed to enter into negotiations on the exercise of that right. Representatives of the SECV and the Gas and Fuel Corporation told the Committee that any pass on of the RRT would in turn be passed on into the prices they charge to industrial and domestic consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>The extent of any price effects of the pass on is not clear at this stage of negotiations. Mr McCammon of BHP told the Committee ``We are in the business of making money, not losing customers'' (Evidence, p. [1/29]). The extent to which RRT is passed on will depend to some degree on the availability and pricing of substitutes. </PARA>
<PARA>The final price of natural gas to the SECV and the Gas and Fuel Corporation and the effects on the prices charged by those bodies will depend on negotiations still to take place. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee heard evidence based on current speculation about possible price effects which suggested that a paper recycling operation may become so marginal as to warrant closure. It was also suggested that a major cement producer might substitute coal for gas with adverse environmental effects. </PARA>
<PARA>Savings to Producers</PARA>
<PARA>In the 1990-91 Budget, the change in Commonwealth Government revenue due to changes to PRRT is estimated as $305 million in 1990-91 and $450 million in 1991-92, a total of $755 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Both producers claim that the net benefit due to the Bass Strait PRRT has been overstated. A detailed submission to this effect was made by Esso Australia Ltd. which questioned the Government's figures. </PARA>
<PARA>Ethane</PARA>
<PARA>Ethane from Bass Strait is used as feedstock for two large petrochemical plants in Melbourne, one of which is associated with one of the producers. The Committee was informed that these plants will be unable to pass on to their customers any cost increases associated with RRT as they sell in an internationally competitive market. It was further claimed that their competitors mostly operate in countries in which the cost of chemical feedstock is already below the Australian cost. The two processors will also be affected in the next few years by substantial tariff reductions. </PARA>
<PARA>Multiplier effect</PARA>
<PARA>Several witnesses pointed out that, if some or all of the RRT is passed on by the producers, there will be a multiplier effect. The higher prices charged by the producers as a result of the RRT will increase the revenue base on which the tax is calculated, leading in turn to even higher prices. As a result, the RRT on gas and ethane may finally be levied at a considerably higher rate than that originally intended by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The extent of this effect will depend, of course, on the extent to which the RRT is actually passed on. A pass on of the full 40% RRT and of all the increases in the tax base caused by the full pass on would produce an effective RRT of 66%. </PARA>
<PARA>Joint costs</PARA>
<PARA>Another potential problem raised in evidence was that the producers' costs, which may be offset against revenue in calculating the tax base, are incurred jointly across the three products they produce. If the RRT on gas and ethane can be passed on while the RRT on oil cannot, scope might exist for the producers to allocate their costs to maximise the pass on benefits of the RRT. This would increase the proportion of tax paid by their customers relative to the proportion that they would bear themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Consultation</PARA>
<PARA>Virtually all witnesses claimed that there had been little or no consultation between Government and industry prior to the introduction of the tax. The Parliamentary Secretary and officers disputed this. </PARA>
<PARA>However, there was a strong view in relevant industry circles that the Government had not understood the potential for pass on of RRT on gas and ethane and that the effects of any such pass on would be unintended side effects of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Greenhouse Impact</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Chamber of Manufactures submitted that ``the increase in industrial gas price as a result of RRT will cause some industry to convert to coal, resulting in dramatically higher greenhouse emissions, energy efficiency opportunities such as co-generation will be lost, sacrificing opportunities for reduction in greenhouse emissions. Allowing an increase in the gas price as a result of government legislation is contradictory to the government's adoption of the Toronto goals'' (Evidence, p. FPA114). </PARA>
<PARA>Witnesses' views</PARA>
<PARA>Written or oral evidence from the following firms and organisations proposed measures either to ban the passing on of RRT on gas and/or ethane, or to limit the effect of any pass on:</PARA>
<PARA>State Electricity Commission of Victoria</PARA>
<PARA>Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria</PARA>
<PARA>Chemplex Australia Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Chemical Industry Council</PARA>
<PARA>Altona Petrochemical Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Chamber of Manufactures/Victorian Gas Users Group</PARA>
<PARA>Esso Australia Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>BHP Petroleum Pty Ltd, while expressing initial opposition to the RRT on gas, expressed its support for the RRT package as a whole and stressed that it had taken major investment decisions on the basis that it would be enacted. Mr Brian McCammon, who represented BHP at the Committee's hearing expressed some scepticism at the potential in practice for pass on of the RRT. </PARA>
<PARA>Potential for pass on</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee received written submissions and heard oral evidence from the representatives of several groups representing producers, processors and users of Bass Strait oil, gas and ethane. The Committee also heard oral evidence from Senator the Hon. Bob McMullan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.There was a clear consensus in this evidence that there was no scope for pass on of the RRT on oil as that commodity is priced locally at world market price and any attempt by the producers to pass on the tax would be immediately undercut by imported product. However, the position on gas and ethane was less clear. </PARA>
<PARA>The Coalition acknowledges the argument advanced by Senator McMullan that it would be difficult for the Coalition or the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . resolve . . . all the problems which will subsequently be resolved in commercial or market discussions between the parties. To try to determine who is going to pass what cost on to whom, under what circumstances, is not a role for the legislation of the Commonwealth. It is not a function which Government can reasonably perform (Evidence, p. FPA135). </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Resources, Alan Griffiths statement to the APEA Annual Conference on 9th April, 1991 stated that Victorian consumers would not pay more for their natural gas as a result of this legislation. This statement by Hon Alan Griffiths reiterated his earlier comments made on ABC radio in February that ``if there is any attempt to pass on these gas prices to, in particular, industrial users in Victoria, then those people can assume that they are being treated unfairly . . . ''</PARA>
<PARA>Compensation</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's decision to provide transitional compensation through the Victorian Government of $30m per annum for the first two years of the RRT recognises that the measure will have significant effects. Some witnesses stressed that this compensation would not necessarily be available to all gas users, and was below the expected additional cost to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>There was concern that this grant was untied. However, Senator McMullan pointed out that ``it is not necessarily going to be an untied grant; that is not a matter about which a final decision has been made'' (Evidence, p. FPA134). He also acknowledged that the compensation would cover only approximately half of the Government's estimate of the potential price impact.</PARA>
<PARA>Impact on Victoria</PARA>
<PARA>A Report by the Victorian Gas Users Group and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures indicated that the approximate annual cost impact of the Resource Rent Tax on the Gas and Fuel Corporation customers, SECV, and Ethane Users could total $90 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Among other things the Report suggested the legislation could have serious, adverse and unintended consequences on Victoria, including Victorian manufacturers being disadvantaged against imports, the potential for exports being reduced, a policy conflict with environmental goals and reduced employment levels. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition APM pointed to the fact that an increase in the gas price could jeopardise future investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem of retrospective accounts to users was also raised during the hearings by Mr. Palmer of Gas and Fuel Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Other concerns</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also heard evidence of concerns on the part of the producers about technical aspects of the legislation. BHP, Esso and the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association all argued for changes to two provisions:</PARA>
<PARA> * retention of the carry forward rate for deductible general expenditure at the long-term bond rate plus 15% rather than the proposal for the long-term bond rate plus 5%; and</PARA>
<PARA> * providing for exploration expenses to retain deductible status for five years from the date of issue of a production licence and (as argued by some witnesses) for deductibility to continue for longer than five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Esso also argued for changes which would permit deductibility of a proportion of the investment in recent Bass Strait developments and allowing deductibility for Oil Basins Limited (OBL or ``Weeks'') royalty. </PARA>
<PARA>The failure to allow full deductibility of all investment expenditure in this bill effectively increases the 40% RRT. </PARA>
<PARA>The Coalition believes that the Government and the producers should further negotiate on these issues with a view to raising the percentage increment faster on the carry forward rate to accommodate more closely the cost of capital. </PARA>
<PARA>Implications for Income Tax Assessment Act</PARA>
<PARA>RRT is currently deductible for income tax purposes only after the final assessment has been made. The Government has decided that RRT instalments under the new system should be deductible for income tax purposes in the income year in which they are paid. However, this will require an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act and no Bill containing such an amendment has yet been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>The new RRT system has effect from 1 July 1990 and the Coalition would consider it unsatisfactory for the related income tax provisions not to be enacted in the 1990-91 financial year. The Coalition believes that the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Bill should be accompanied by a bill to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Importance of the legislation</PARA>
<PARA>The Coalition accepts that it is important that the Bill be passed in this session to give a proper legislative base to the petroleum resource rent tax system. The Government's proposed changes have been followed by significant investment and other decisions by the producers and, in their central provisions and aims, have general support. The Coalition accepts that an RRT appropriately structured could be a more efficient system than that it replaces, providing that it does not lead to any increase in the burden of tax. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Committee notes that the Government has been aware of concerns about the impact of RRT on gas and ethane users and about a possibly disruptive transition to the more efficient tax system. It is regrettable that these concerns were not addressed more effectively in the several months between announcement of the scheme and the arrival of the Bill in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>The Legislation is a budget bill with significant revenue implications. Further substantial investment has taken place based on the assurance of the passage of this legislation, its potential impact on user industries and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>However, evidence was presented to the Committee which indicated that there are some basic defects in the bill and that there could be a number of unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>It was argued strongly by BHP that most of these problems could be addressed following passage of the legislation. On the other hand a number of other witnesses sought significant amendments immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the assurances of the Minister there was great concern about a possible rise in gas prices resulting from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepted a Coalition amendment that the Government be required to report to the Parliament by 30th November, 1992 on the operation of the Act including its impact on prices and industry and on the development of new offshore petroleum prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government refused to accept the Opposition's amendment to include in the Bill a guarantee that the $60 million compensation package to the Victorian Government be made specifically to minimise transitional pressures on gas prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government refused to accept an amendment to the starting date for the application of the five year rule governing expenditure write-off to the date of application for a development licence rather that the date of issue. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator McMullan mentioned this amendment. While I have the opportunity, I thank him for the undertakings that he gave following the debate we had in the Committee, particularly concerning the minimising of the period between the application for, and the issue of, production licences, but also for the other assurances he gave. </PARA>

<PARA> I will comment briefly on Senator McMullan's remarks about the clause that the Opposition is moving to have inserted into the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Bill, namely, the clause relating to the grant to minimise transitional pressures on gas prices and the $60m payment that is to be made to Victoria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not doubting Senator McMullan's sincerity at all. There is no question about his sincerity in terms of the assurance that he has giving but there is a credibility problem today in relation to his Government and the Victorian Government, and the more transparent the assurances that are being given in relation to what is a very important issue does go, very importantly, not to the core of the Bill, but to an essential part of the package that the Government is proposing. There are the amendments to the Act but there is also, as an essential part of that package, the special payment to Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the assurances that the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, gave to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association on 9 April that this resource rent tax would not have any impact on prices in Victoria, Senator McMullan knows and we know that it is likely to have an impact on prices and that this is the very reason why the Government is making this grant. So it is an integral part of the whole deal. Senator McMullan may be right; it may not necessarily force the Victorian Government to act in the way which both the Government and we want it to act, but it is increasing the transparency of the proposition that is contained in the second reading speech. It does have some significance for ethane producers, contrary to Senator McMullan's remarks because the amendment says that this payment will be made:</PARA>

<PARA>The important part of including those words was precisely to take account of the situation of the ethane users-the petrochemical industry. So this amendment does have a direct relevance in a way that has no mention in the second reading speech of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite frankly, Senator McMullan's Government forgot about the implications for Bass Strait gas in its Budget decision last year. It forgot about them completely; it did not have a clue that it would have an implication for ethane and, therefore, for the petrochemical industry in Victoria which employs more than 2,000 people and has assets attaching to it valued at $1 1/2 billion. It is an important export earner and also an important supplier to the domestic market against fierce international competition. The Government did not have a clue about all of those things. For Senator McMullan to say that we are being silly and that we ought to trust the Government and take its assurances without doing everything we can to sheet home those assurances to the Government and make them clear to the public, the producers, the Victorian Government and everyone else, defies all logic. Senator McMullan has not produced one logical reason for opposing this amendment. Therefore, I have pleasure, on behalf of the Opposition and, in my view, on behalf of the producers, the consumers and the public of Victoria, in moving the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

It strikes me that as this is a Bill imposing taxation, for a start, one could argue that it should be a request rather than an amendment. Secondly, to the extent that this amendment seeks to appropriate money it should not originate in the Senate. It would strictly require--</PARA></TALK.START>

Thirdly, as the Bill is for a law imposing taxation it ought to deal only with that and not introduce another provision dealing with another matter. It may be that the issues I am raising go to the constitutionality of the amendment rather than a question of it being in order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to that and if Senator Watson disagrees with me he can tell me. I have had an opportunity to look at this clause because it was mentioned during the second reading debate. The way I see it is that moneys would not be appropriated by this clause. Moneys would be appropriated only if the Parliament decided to do so, because it says in the proposed clause:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is payable to the State of Victoria, out of monies appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If the Parliament-I am speaking in an apolitical manner-decided not to appropriate moneys for this purpose no payments would be made. So it is not an appropriation as such. I am not quite sure what it is, but it is certainly not an appropriation. Therefore, it seems to me that the clause is in order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will now address my remarks to the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and speak in the debate on the Opposition's amendment. The Opposition has put forward this amendment to add this clause because it wants to impose conditions on the grant to the State of Victoria. It is not acknowledging that the conditions which will be applied-because it will be a special purpose grant when it is made by, I understand, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1990-1991 in August-will be related to an exchange of letters between the two governments which will be covered by a clause in that Appropriation Bill.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson says that it is just another reminder, but I would have thought that people ought to have more respect for the drafting of the laws of the nation rather than to put poorly drafted little reminders in a Bill which will be sitting there for years to come. I would have thought that, if the Opposition wanted the amendment drafted in that way, it would have drafted it a bit better. I cannot believe that this is the best drafting it could come up with. I think it ought to be embarrassed by it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment, and they should be embarrassed to be doing so. If I were trying to do what the Opposition is trying to do, I guess I would have made it clear that the amendment was referring to some future appropriation, rather than a term such as `there is payable to the State of Victoria', as the clause says. Yet, as the Chairman has ruled, there is no payment to the State of Victoria because of this clause; it will still have to be appropriated by another Bill originating, correctly, in the House of Representatives. I think it is very bad legislative practice to put what is, in effect, a meaningless, confused and ambiguous clause in a Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, when Senator Watson moved an amendment in the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration to Senator Short's amendment, he proposed to add the words-which are now in the amendment moved by Senator Short- `in order to minimise transitional pressure on gas prices on an equitable basis'. To put a term such as `on an equitable basis' in a Bill like this is inviting a lawyer's feast. Such vague terminology is just the sort of thing that invites litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I oppose the amendment very strongly, mainly on the grounds that it is poorly drafted. To the extent that it seeks to do anything at all, it would be unconstitutional. It hardly adds to the Parliament's reputation to act in this way. I think it makes the Senate a laughing stock. I do not mind that; it is those opposite who want to elevate the role and image of the Senate. So be it. Senator Short said that he just could not understand Senator McMullan's opposition to the clause. </PARA>

The vehemence shown by Senator McMullan and by me is obviously not because we are opposed to the grant and the conditions which ought to be placed on it, because we are agreed about that. There is no dispute there. We dispute the meaningless way in which the Opposition seeks to insert the clause into this Bill, quite apart from the issues which I raised in my point of order about tacking on another issue to a tax Bill, which makes it a matter of no effect in any case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think this issue ought to be left to be provided for in Appropriations Bill (No. 2) and for the proper exchange of letters between the two governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the amendment is a threadbare second best. If the Opposition had really wanted to do something for people who will now be under cost pressures as a result of increased prices due to the impact of the resource rent tax (RRT) it should have supported our amendment, which sought to achieve just that. If our amendment had been supported, no pass-on whatsoever would have been possible. As it is, this amendment does not change the position that at best the purchasers of gas and ethane-and that is doubtful, provided the clause is effective-will receive no more than 50 per cent of the price increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, having said that, I believe that there is some value in confirming that this amount of money should be applied to the purposes for which it is intended and to which both State and Federal governments have expressly agreed. I believe that it is also desirable-if the insertion of the term `equitable' achieves that-to ensure that part of the $30m is applied to the increase in price for ethane purchasers. They are in an international market unable to pass on price increases, and I believe that there is a case for ensuring that some compensation comes their way. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, we have had representations-and I think the Minister is well aware of them-from industry in Victoria, particularly the cement industry, where the cost increases are likely to put companies under extreme pressure and could well result in dismissals and an increase in unemployment in an area of a State which has suffered considerably during this economic recession which we `had to have'. On balance, without passing any comment as to the quality of drafting or the ultimate effectiveness of the clause, the Australian Democrats will support this amendment as a safety mechanism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, in order to give the Government the passage of this Bill by 6.30 p.m., I must clarify the purpose behind the amendments moved by my colleague Senator Short. The amendment does not seek to appropriate funds, and I thank you, Mr Chairman, for your clarification. The emphasis is certainly on the words `out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament for this purpose'. The words cannot purport to appropriate moneys, as was suggested by our friend and colleague Senator Coates, who so effectively chaired the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which delivered this very good report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this is not an amendment to the Bill, but an amendment to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.

Firstly, the rate is effectively more than 40 per cent because of the lack of deductibility of all the relevant costs. Secondly, because of the enhanced revenue base on which the 40 per cent rate is calculated, there is a multiplier effect which increases the real 40 per cent rate to something substantially higher.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Since coming to power in 1983 the Government has committed itself to improving the management of Commonwealth fisheries. In December 1989 the Government released a major policy statement setting out the future directions for Commonwealth fisheries management. The policy statement emphasised four objectives for fisheries management:</PARA>
<PARA>- To ensure that fisheries resources are not over-exploited and that any exploitation is at a level which can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment;</PARA>
<PARA>- To enable commercial fishing operations to be as economically efficient as possible, using the most appropriate technology to achieve the greatest net returns;</PARA>
<PARA>- To create conditions where fishermen are able to make a payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource for private gain, recognising that such a payment should not reduce the profitability of fishing operations to less than their current levels; and</PARA>
<PARA>- To ensure that the administration of Commonwealth fisheries should be conducted on the most efficient and effective basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Legislation designed to achieve the first three objectives, (which comprise the essence of the Government's fisheries management policies) is being drafted and will be put before Parliament in the autumn sittings next year. In addition to introducing new policies arising from the Government's policy statement this legislation will replace the Fisheries Act 1952 which will be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation before us now concerns the administration of fisheries management. The Government recognises the importance of an effective and efficient administrative structure if the fisheries management objectives which I have outlined are to be achieved and sustained. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation establishes a new statutory authority-the Australian Fisheries Management Authority-to undertake the Government's fisheries management responsibilities. It also establishes a fishing industry policy council to provide advice to the Government on matters affecting the fishing industry and an Australian Fisheries Management Authority Selection Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>An associated Fisheries Research and Development Corporation will also be established under the auspices of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 to commence from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>My remarks will be primarily about the new Authority, although at the end I will come back to the selection processes and the role and composition of the policy council. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to establish the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to undertake its fisheries management responsibilities which will be included in the Fisheries Management Bill to be introduced in the autumn sitting. It has done this because it believes that the statutory authority model of public administration has a number of important advantages. </PARA>
<PARA>These advantages include:</PARA>
<PARA>- Increased industry and community involvement in decision making through an enhanced role for the management advisory committees, and industry and community involvement in selecting the governing board;</PARA>
<PARA>- Increased flexibility of operations, without the constraints of a departmental structure;</PARA>
<PARA>- Increased public accountability for the Authority for both decision making and expenditure;</PARA>
<PARA>- Increased independence in day to day decision making, with ministerial involvement at a strategic level rather than on-going involvement in operational matters; and</PARA>
<PARA>- Increased incentives to ensure that all of the Authority's operations are conducted in a cost efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to ensure that these advantages are realised, the charter of the new Authority will be exclusively fisheries management. The Authority will not have to undertake the additional broad policy functions currently being performed by the Australian Fisheries Service. A policy branch will remain within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to handle those matters. In most cases the functions of these two bodies will be quite distinct. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will be required to manage the marine resources of the Australian fishing zone in accordance with the Government's sustainable development objectives and policies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority's principal responsibilities will be:</PARA>
<PARA>- To develop and implement fishery-specific management plans;</PARA>
<PARA>- To set sustainable catch quotas for our fish stocks;</PARA>
<PARA>- To grant on-going or temporary access to fish resources;</PARA>
<PARA>- To effectively monitor the activities of Australian and foreign fishermen licensed to exploit our fish resources; and</PARA>
<PARA>- To monitor the general performance of each fishery and introduce, where necessary, appropriate restructuring programs. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to undertake these responsibilities the Authority will have an important role in identifying research and development requirements for fisheries and commissioning expert assistance from organisations such as the CSIRO, the Bureau of Rural Resources and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. </PARA>
<PARA>The policy branch within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy will retain its responsibility for advising the Government on broad strategic fisheries policy matters. These will include the development of resource use and environmental policies, advising on policy matters concerning foreign access to the Australian fishing zone, developing policy on fisheries access rights and the collection of community returns from the fishing industry, monitoring the effect of taxation rulings on fisheries management and developing policy that will reduce domestic and international marketing impediments for Australian fish products. The fisheries policy branch will also be required to monitor the overall performance of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority in regard to its implementation of the Government's fisheries management objectives and the general performance and profitability of the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>As indicated and in keeping with the principle that formal inter-government negotiations are lead by Ministers and their officials, the Department will generally take the leading role in delegations to inter-Governmental negotiations on fisheries matters and will represent the Government on multilateral fisheries fora. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will also have a role in inter-Governmental negotiations where these relate to fisheries management. It will assist the Department as required in such negotiations, as for example in the bilateral and trilateral arrangements with Japan concerning the international management of the southern bluefin tuna stocks, and the arrangements with Papua New Guinea on the management of Torres Strait fisheries, and with New Zealand on the driftnet surveillance program. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the new arrangements there will be a need to continue and where possible strengthen the close working relationship which currently exists between the Australian Fisheries Service, the Bureau of Rural Resources, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and relevant external agencies like the CSIRO. Because of the particular importance which the Minister places on the work of the Bureau of Rural Resources he will ensure that additional staff resources are made available to it from within his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>I also note, in keeping with the undertaking in the policy statement, that one quarter of a per cent of the gross value of fisheries production, will be provided by the Government for fisheries research, and these funds will be distributed between the Authority, the Bureau of Rural Resources and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the discretion of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>An important feature of the new administrative arrangement is the enhanced role which the Authority will be able to give (at its discretion) to management advisory committees. In order to meet the challenging responsibilities which I have outlined above the Authority will be able to devolve functions to these committees to perform on behalf of AFMA. The Authority will still be the body which will be held accountable for meeting the fisheries management objectives, but nevertheless, provided that the Authority has confidence in a particular management advisory committee, that committee will be able to exercise considerable influence in the management of the fishery concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>The functions of the management advisory committees are to advise the Authority in relation to fisheries management, to act as a liaison mechanism between the Authority and the fishermen concerned, and to assist in keeping the Authority informed about the biological and economic status of the fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>Management advisory committees will consist of a chairperson (to be selected by the Authority), the fishery manager and up to seven members selected by the Authority after consultation with the industry, relevant state or territory governments and relevant members of the research community. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government recognises that the strength and success of the Authority will depend on the quality and calibre of its board. The Government is firmly convinced that it is highly desirable to select the board on the basis of expertise, and this legislation establishes a selection committee which will choose five of the board members. The selection committee itself will consist of two industry representatives to be nominated by the peak industry body, two community representatives, nominee of the Australian Fisheries Council, and a presiding member to be selected by the Minister. The Minister hopes to be in a position to announce the name of the presiding member within the next few weeks. The National Fishing Industry Council will be specified in the regulations as the peak industry body. </PARA>
<PARA>There are clear parallels between these selection procedures for the Authority's board and those which are used for the statutory marketing authorities and the research and development corporations associated with the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. However there are also some important differences. The most important difference is the role which industry will play. Industry quite rightly has an influential role in the outlook and activities of the statutory marketing authorities and the research and development corporations, and is a key participant in the formation of industry commercial philosophy of those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority will have the task of enforcing regulations which will prevent fisheries from being over-exploited or over-capitalised. At times the collective interest of all the fishermen in the fishery and of the broader community may be at odds with the self interest of individual fishermen. Since the Authority will be a Government body undertaking the Government's regulatory role in fisheries management it would be inappropriate for industry to have a dominant influence. To do so would be like asking the players to umpire their own football match. At the same time it is highly desirable for some board members of the Authority to have fishing industry experience. </PARA>
<PARA>For this reason the Minister has decided that the board of the Authority will consist of a chairperson and a Government member to be selected by the Minister, with five directors to be selected by the special selection committee on the basis of their expertise. The areas of expertise will include commercial fishing; fishing industry operations other than fishing; fisheries science, natural resource management, economics and business management. There will be a requirement that no more than two directors be currently engaged in the fishing industry. The managing director of the Authority will be chosen by these seven directors and will be an ex-officio member of the board. </PARA>
<PARA>Having given the Authority some independence from the industry and indeed from day to day ministerial control, it is important that there are mechanisms through which the Authority will be held accountable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will be accountable at three levels. It will be required to submit both a longer term corporate plan and an annual operational plan to the Minister setting out the means by which it will achieve its statutory objectives. The Minister may approve or seek a variation to these documents. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will be required to provide an annual report to Parliament, and will be subject to the scrutiny of parliamentary committees. As well it will be subject to an annual audit by the Auditor General. The Minister will have the power to direct the Authority in exceptional circumstances, but it will be a requirement that any such direction be presented to both houses of Parliament and reported in the authority's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will be required to have a high degree of disclosure in its annual report. It will be required to focus in that document on strategic reporting against the goals and key parameters for performance outlined in its corporate and annual operational plans. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will also be accountable to the fishing industry and the general public. In addition to the annual report the Authority will be required to hold public meetings at least once each year in order to ensure that the fishing industry and the community in general have an opportunity to consult the board, to question them and to have them justify their management actions.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the matter of staffing for the new Authority. The Minister has consistently stressed that he wants the employment conditions of the current staff in the Australian Fisheries Service to be safeguarded, and for employees transferring from the Australian Fisheries Service to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to continue to work under the Public Service Act 1922 and to enjoy their current conditions of service, including superannuation entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister also recognises the importance of providing the Authority with the flexibility to develop remuneration packages to attract and reward staff with particular skills. For this reason the legislation will give the Authority the power to set the terms and conditions of those employees who are recruited from outside the Australian Fisheries Service. </PARA>
<PARA>I also wish to make some brief remarks about the Fishing Industry Policy Council. This legislation establishes a statutory fishing industry policy council which will advise the Minister on matters which have been referred to it, or indeed on any other matters affecting the well-being of the industry. The Council will convene meetings and conferences, produce reports, consult with other persons as necessary, and generally provide the Minister with an independent and wide-ranging source of information on the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The composition of the Council will be broad. It will consist of a chairperson, the chairperson of the Authority, the chairperson of the Fishing Industry Research and Development Corporation, a representative of the National Fishing Industry Training Council Limited, two industry representatives representing the spectrum of catching, processing and marketing interests to be nominated by the peak industry body, a representative of recreational fishermen, and a person having an interest in environmental and/or consumer aspects. This membership may be widened to include representatives of other groups at a later stage at the discretion of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will not have any significant effect on Government expenditure. The Authority will be funded on the same basis as that currently in place for the Australian Fisheries Service of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, with 90% of attributable management costs being recovered from the fishing industry. Some additional Government funding may initially be required to cover transitional arrangements. The Industry Commission is to review the basis of cost recovery for fisheries management prior to December 1991 and every five years thereafter. However it is worth remembering that the Government, as custodian of the marine resources of the Australian fishing zone, will always retain certain responsibilities and meet the costs associated with the management of those resources. Examples of such responsibilities are surveillance costs to detect illegal foreign fishing activities, and protecting the traditional way of life of Torres Strait Islanders in joint Authority with Queensland and in treaty with Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA>In drafting this legislation the Government intends, where relevant, the new policy adjustments for statutory marketing authorities arising from the report of the Davis Committee be included in the arrangements for the Authority. In line with this the legislation does not contain any restrictions on the appointment of directors because of their age and limits the duration of their tenure to three consecutive terms. It also requires the Authority to identify key indicators of its performance in its corporate and annual operational plans and to report on these in its annual report. </PARA>
<PARA>The industry, through representatives of the National Fishing Industry Council, have been kept informed of the development of this legislation and have actively participated in ensuring a smooth transition to the new Authority through a special liaison committee. They have been supportive and constructive and many of their suggestions are embodied in this Bill. The Minister thanks them for their assistance and looks forward to continuing productive consultations. With their assistance the Government believes that the target date for the establishment of the Authority on or before 1 July 1991 can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>FISHERIES MANAGEMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Government regards the effective management of the Commonwealth's fisheries as a very important responsibility and throughout its term it has been committed to improving that management. Last December the Fisheries Administration Bill was introduced into Parliament. That Bill will establish a new statutory authority-the Australian Fisheries Management Authority-to undertake the Government's fisheries management responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before us now, together with supporting legislation, provides the powers for the new Authority to undertake the Government's fisheries management responsibilities. This new legislation will replace both the Fisheries Act 1952 and the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Act 1968 and will establish a framework for the management of Commonwealth fisheries well into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill has been the result of the most intensive review and examination of Commonwealth fisheries management since the 1950s-a review which culminated in the policy statement released in December 1989 `New Directions for Commonwealth Fisheries Management in the 1990s'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will give effect to the three objectives of fisheries management identified in the policy statement:</PARA>
<PARA>- To ensure that fisheries resources are not over-exploited and that any exploitation is at a level which can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment;</PARA>
<PARA>- To enable commercial fishing operations to be as economically efficient as possible, using the most appropriate technology to achieve the greatest net returns; and</PARA>
<PARA>- To create conditions where fishermen are able to earn significant profits from which to make a payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource for private gain, recognising that such a payment should not reduce the profitability of fishing operations to less than their current levels. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of these objectives concerns the conservation of the resource, and more generally, the conservation of the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government regards the protection of fisheries from over-exploitation as a matter of the utmost importance. Honourable senators would be aware that the Government has consistently emphasised the importance of sustainable development, and sustainable resource management policies. Put simply, the Government believes it has a duty to the community to ensure that the nation's resources are protected and preserved so that future generations can continue to benefit from them. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also has specific provisions to control fishing activities which are harmful to the marine environment, such as driftnet fishing. The Prime Minister has consistently emphasised Australia's policy of seeking a global ban on large scale driftnet fishing. This legislation bans pelagic driftnet fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone and will also enable the Government to ratify the convention for the prohibition of fishing with long driftnets in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA>The fisheries resource is an excellent example of a renewable natural resource that can be managed in a balanced way so as to yield returns in both the present and the future. Of course the resource also has uses other than commercial fishing, and these too must be managed in an ecologically sustainable framework. These broader aspects of aquatic resource management are now being examined through the ecologically sustainable development process that the Government initiated last year. </PARA>
<PARA>At various times there have been suggestions from some that fisheries should be treated as though they were a resource to be mined and that it would not matter if a fishery or fish species was pushed to the verge of extinction if that maximised profits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not accept this argument and I wish to make it perfectly clear that the conservation objective of fisheries management may in some cases limit our ability to achieve the second objective of achieving the maximum economic return from the resource. </PARA>
<PARA>For example in a multi species fishery it may be necessary to limit the catch of species which are not under threat if continued fishing were to endanger other species that were part of the catch. Fortunately this situation is not likely to occur frequently, and in most cases the most efficient level of exploitation of fisheries resources will be quite consistent with the conservation objective. </PARA>
<PARA>Having said this it should be emphasised that the Government is also committed to ensuring that fishing is undertaken as economically and efficiently as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>This means reducing excessive levels of fishing capacity, keeping regulations, especially those which impede efficiency, to a minimum and ensuring that fisheries administration is results oriented and cost effective. In this regard the Government's northern prawn fishery restructuring arrangements will be a most significant achievement and will significantly increase fishing efficiency while reducing pressure on the resource in the Commonwealth's most valuable fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>The third objective of management, that of creating conditions where the industry is able to pay a return to the community for the use of its resource, has been widely misunderstood and misrepresented. This Government is not about to take steps which will frustrate, impede or restrict commercial initiatives. Nor will it take actions which would reduce the valuable contribution which the fishing industry makes to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Government does accept the principle that our scarce and valuable fisheries resources should, where possible, be priced so that sensible decisions about exploitation are taken. This is entirely consistent with our sustainable development policies. In practice what this means is that our scarce fisheries resources will be carefully husbanded in both a biological and economic sense so that many generations of Australians will benefit from their use. It also means that fishermen who are given privileged access to public resources which enable them to make very large profits-super profits which exceed normal levels of profitability-should pay a share of these super profits to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>The fisheries policy statement made it quite clear that a community return would only be sought where new super profits were generated-mainly from restructuring existing fisheries to make them more profitable. </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage the most likely fishery in which the Government can foresee super profits arising from restructuring is the northern prawn fishery. While the details of the community return in the northern prawn fishery have not been finalised, industry can be assured that it will not be introduced until after the restructuring is complete, that the new arrangements will not be onerous, and that the industry will have the opportunity to be involved before the details are finalised. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also appropriate to take this opportunity to reassure the industry on another matter. Honourable senators would be aware that the Industry Commission is currently investigating the appropriate level of cost recovery which the industry is to pay for the management of Commonwealth fisheries. This reference to the Industry Commission is not intended to delay the establishment of the new management authority-it is not to be a further review of Commonwealth fisheries management per se, but rather a very focussed review of cost recovery levels and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Fishing Industry Council has sought assurance that cost recovery levels will not be changed from the current arrangements until the Industry Commission review is complete and has been considered by the Government. The Government is happy to give this assurance, and it is appropriate to reiterate a commitment made in the fisheries policy statement, namely that `as an interim arrangement (until the Industry Commission review is complete), the Government will require the industry to meet the same proportion of the combined costs of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy Fisheries Group that it meets of the total costs of the Australian Fisheries Service's operations in the final two years of existence'. (Page 111). </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the Bill before us and the significant changes it makes to the way fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone is to be administered-particularly in relation to the role of plans of management and the new arrangements to be introduced for Commonwealth fishing licences. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1985 this Government introduced the first plan of management for a Commonwealth fishery into Parliament. The plan was for the Southern Bluefin Tuna fishery. Since that time the usefulness of plans of management for fisheries administration has been repeatedly demonstrated, and fisheries plans of management will continue to be central to this legislation. A plan of management will contain all the necessary information about the fishery including a description of the fishery either by area, species or fishing method used, or some combination of these. It will contain all the rules of the fishery and will describe what the statutory fishing right is, including any conditions such as constraints on transferability. The board of the new Fisheries Management Authority will establish management advisory committees containing industry representatives and these committees will play a fundamental role in the development of the plans of management. The management advisory committees will of course be accountable to the board of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>In conjunction with the increased emphasis on plans of management the Government is making some important changes to Commonwealth fishing boat licences in order to achieve greater certainty and control over fishing operations in Commonwealth waters. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two reasons for these changes. First, the Government believes it is appropriate for the ongoing nature of fishing rights in established fisheries-those administered through a plan of management-to be recognised and recorded in a formal fishing rights register. This will give fishermen greater security, and will establish the rights as an asset against which they can borrow. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, it is important for the Government to have greater knowledge about, and control of, fishing activities being undertaken in parts of the Australian Fishing Zone which are not subject to formal management arrangements. The existing Commonwealth fishing boat licence which allowed holders to fish anywhere in the Australian Fishing Zone other than in a managed fishery did not allow this control and this has inevitably contributed to some of the problems of excessive fishing capacity which are now being faced.The new licensing arrangements will result in the existing Commonwealth fishing boat licence being phased out after 1 July 1991, and in its place there will be various types of fishery-specific entitlements. These entitlements will authorise fishing activities in specific areas of Commonwealth waters. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the main forms of fishery-specific entitlement will be a statutory fishing right created through a plan of management, which will recognise longer term access to established fisheries. This level of access can be compared to the endorsement of the current licence to operate in a managed fishery; under the existing system licences are only issued for 12 months and could at least theoretically not be reissued. Under the new licence system, provided that levies are paid, and that fisheries regulations are adhered to, it will normally be ongoing in nature and will provide guaranteed access beyond the current one-year licensing period. </PARA>
<PARA>Details of statutory fishing rights will be recorded in a statutory fishing rights register which will also record third party (or mortgage holder) interests. The register will merely be a record of a third party interest and will not give that interest any effect or validity it does not otherwise have. Any transactions relative to a statutory fishing right must involve all parties with a recorded interest in that right. Where a third party has an interest in a statutory fishing right it will be the responsibility of that party to ensure their interests are protected by recording that interest in the register. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Fisheries Management Authority will not recognise any interest unless it is recorded in the register. </PARA>
<PARA>Another type of fishery-specific entitlement will be a fishing permit. Fishing permits will normally apply in those fisheries where there is no plan of management, and they will be issued for fixed periods of time up to five years. They will not confer an ongoing right to the fishery and will not be recorded in the statutory fishing rights register. The fishing permit will apply to a specified boat and will define the area, species and gear which can be used for fishing. It will also contain the conditions with which the holder must comply. The application for a fishing permit will seek details of the proposed operations, and the fishing permit will limit operations to those specified in the permit. Fishing permits will also be used for fishing related activities including the operation of fish processing or carrier boats or to allow the testing of fishing gear in otherwise closed areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fisheries Levy Act 1984 will be replaced by the Fisheries Levy Bill 1991. This will enable levy payments for both of these new fishery-specific entitlements to be collected. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation will contain provisions similar to those of the Fisheries Act 1952 for scientific exploration and foreign fishing activity in the Australian Fishing Zone through the issue of scientific permits and foreign fishing licences. </PARA>
<PARA>A scientific permit will provide for short term access and allow a specific program of scientific work or exploratory fishing to be undertaken. There will be no charge for a scientific permit, and the fishing operations undertaken with it will be closely controlled by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority in consultation with appropriate research agencies. Conditions will be attached to a scientific permit as appropriate, such as the provision of research data and the carriage of scientific observers. </PARA>
<PARA>A foreign fishing licence will also be fishery specific, will be valid for up to one year, and will be subject to the payment of fees and levies, as well as other fishery specific conditions. The Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Act 1981 will be replaced by the Foreign Fishing Licences Levy Bill 1991 in order to collect the levy payments and the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Act 1981 will be replaced by the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Bill 1991 to collect payments from overseas governments or commercial interests for access to the Australian Fishing Zone. These new levy Bills do not change the basis of levy collection from foreign fishing boats but simply place that collection within the framework of the new legislative instruments and administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government recognises that effective fisheries management and scientific research depend on accurate and timely records of fish caught and fishing operations. One focus of this package of legislation is to improve both of these areas of activity, and an improvement in the quality of fishing logbook information is critical to this. Under this Bill fishermen will be required to complete their logbooks in an accurate and timely manner, and there will be penalties for failing to submit logbooks and for providing false information. </PARA>
<PARA>The fisheries policy statement clearly indicated that the Government would not auction the access rights of existing fishermen in developed fisheries, but that there could be circumstances in which some of the rights in new fisheries would be subject to competitive bidding. This policy is given effect in the associated Bill, the Statutory Fishing Rights Charge Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I hasten to add that the Government clearly recognises that it is most important to provide incentives for exploration and development of new fisheries, otherwise no new fisheries will be found. Consequently any decisions to embark on an auction of new fishing rights will only be undertaken after the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is satisfied that the interests of the discoverer(s) of the new resource have been catered for or that they received an adequate return to justify their risk and their investment. </PARA>
<PARA>I now wish to make a few remarks about surveillance and enforcement of fisheries management. </PARA>
<PARA>The best system of fisheries management will only work if it is effectively enforced. The Government recognises that the best way of encouraging fishermen to comply with regulations is to involve them in the decision making process, and is achieving this through the management advisory committees. However it is also important for there to be an effective system of monitoring, control and surveillance in order to back up fisheries management decisions and this in turn will give the industry confidence in fisheries management. This legislation provides the powers for the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to carry out the necessary surveillance and enforcement actions. </PARA>
<PARA>While this section of the legislation is largely carried over from the Fisheries Act 1952 new provisions have been added to allow the licensing of fish receivers in order to facilitate the introduction of individual transferable quota schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill maintains the provisions in the Fisheries Act 1952 which give effect to the fisheries part of the offshore constitutional settlement. Quite clearly fisheries management is much more effective if it can be administered in a way which encompasses entire stocks rather than being constrained by arbitrary lines drawn on the sea. I note that we have moved some considerable distance with the States over the period in which this Government has been in office towards achieving this rationality of jurisdiction as a basis upon which to undertake effective management. However, there is still room to do more, particularly in relation to those fisheries where the same stock is caught in the waters off several different States. The new Authority will need to give this matter careful attention. The Southern Shark fishery is a clear example where further progress can be made, and indeed the best solution for this fishery may be to seek State agreement for the Commonwealth to assume management responsibility for all of the shark fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now comment on the provisions which this Bill makes for the review of the allocation of statutory fishing rights. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation establishes a specialist review panel-the Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel-which will, upon application, review the allocation of statutory fishing rights created under a plan of management. The Government has been concerned that in the past the procedure for the review of fishing rights allocation decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not always taken sufficient account of the impact of the granting of additional rights to a particular fisherman on the total capacity of the fishery to sustain additional effort. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the new arrangements the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will retain responsibility for considering appeals as to whether an individual satisfies the conditions specified in a plan of management for entry to a fishery. Appeals about the manner in which the available fishing rights are to be distributed among those fishermen who satisfy the entry conditions will be considered by the Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel. Where an appeal is made the Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel will undertake a review of the allocation of all fishing rights of the same class, taking account of the comparative merits of all applicants. In arriving at its decisions the Panel will consider all matters affecting the well being of the fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>The Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel will be quite independent from the management authority. Each case will be reviewed by three members-a principal member appointed by the Minister and two other members chosen by the principal member from a panel of members. </PARA>
<PARA>In the appointment of the principal member the intention is to consult with the Attorney-General as the Minister responsible for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on this matter. This will assist in ensuring that an appropriate link is maintained between the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the review panel. </PARA>
<PARA>The panel of members will be selected by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority selection committee, using the same selection criteria that the committee uses to select board members. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel will only be concerned with the review of decisions affecting the allocation of fishing rights and permits. Other decisions made under this legislation will continue to be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>My final remarks about this package of legislation deal with research and development in the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Fisheries research is vital to the successful management of Australia's fisheries. A sound understanding of the biology and distribution of fish stocks is essential if harvesting from these fisheries is to be sustained in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of fish stocks are already threatened by overfishing. There is a need for further research into the nature and distribution of stocks if this situation is not to become more widespread. </PARA>
<PARA>Assessing the size and condition of a specific fish stock which is constantly mobile and rarely completely isolated from other stocks is a costly and difficult exercise. </PARA>
<PARA>Research in this area is, therefore, inherently more difficult, more costly and more time consuming than that in most other industries in the primary industries and energy portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>Nor is the need for research confined to biological aspects of fisheries. As in many other industries the post-harvest phase has become increasingly important in ensuring good returns are received by participants. This is especially true where the resource is limited and there is little opportunity to increase production. If Australia is to continue to compete on world markets, greater attention must be given to finding better and more efficient ways of handling and transporting fish products and ensuring that the product offered is of high quality so that it attracts high prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's policy on research and development in the primary industries and energy sectors was set out in the report `Research, Innovation and Competitiveness', released in May 1989. The thrust of that report was the need to improve the funding, organisation and administration of research and development in these industries. The report recognised:</PARA>
<PARA>- the benefits of research and development corporations as appropriate structures for effectively administering portfolio research and development programs and for allowing industry an input into the decision-making process on research and development;</PARA>
<PARA>- that those who benefit directly from research and development should bear responsibility for funding that research;</PARA>
<PARA>- that the Government has a responsibility to prevent over-exploitation of community owned natural resources, such as fisheries, and must therefore be prepared to bear a larger proportion of research and development costs than might otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA>In line with these policy guidelines the Government will replace the existing Fishing Industry Research and Development Council with the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation will be established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, and amendments to that Act are included in this package of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of the new research corporation will lead to greater flexibility and autonomy of fisheries research and development administration, as well as providing an increased opportunity for industry involvement and ensuring that funds are directed to research areas of the greatest potential benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts that it has a responsibility to contribute funds for fisheries research and development but also believes that industry, as the major beneficiary of research, should share some of this responsibility. Neither State nor Commonwealth fishermen currently contribute to research and development funded by the current Fishing Industry Research and Development Council. In line with the Government's policy of ensuring that beneficiaries play a part in funding, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 will be amended to enable industry to contribute funds to the fisheries research and development corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Revised funding arrangements for fisheries research and development were announced in the fisheries policy statement. Under the new arrangements the Commonwealth will provide funding equal to 0.5% Of the gross value of fisheries production and if the industry (including both State and Commonwealth licensed fishermen) contributes at the relatively low level of 0.25% of the gross value of fisheries production the Commonwealth will also match this amount of funding. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition the Government will provide funds equivalent to a further 0.25% of the gross value of production, for additional fisheries research to be undertaken or administered by the management authority, the Bureau of Rural Resources or the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. This will take Government's total contribution for fisheries research and development to a maximum of 1.0% gross value of production and the total funds available for fisheries research to 1.25% gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary, the changes to the administration and funding of fisheries research and development will</PARA>
<PARA>- mean more money for research,</PARA>
<PARA>- provide a more effective administrative framework for allocating funds and assessing research and development requirements,</PARA>
<PARA>- encourage industry participation in funding research and at the same time provide the opportunity for greater industry involvement in research and development decision making. </PARA>
<PARA>I will conclude by emphasising the Government's belief that the package of fisheries legislation before the House makes an important step forward in fisheries management. It implements the management initiatives contained in the fisheries policy statement, through the Fisheries Administration Bill it establishes the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and it makes important changes to fisheries research arrangements. These changes build on the existing solid framework for fisheries management which has been progressively developed through the term of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>FISHING LEVY BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill complements the Fisheries Management Bill 1991, which I presented earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>The second reading speech for the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 outlined how the new arrangements for granting access to fisheries under the Commonwealth's jurisdiction would work. The purpose of this Bill is to collect a levy from those fishermen that have been granted access under the Fisheries Management Bill 1991. It replaces the Fisheries Levy Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>STATUTORY FISHING RIGHTS CHARGE BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also complements the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 which I presented earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>The second reading speech for the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 reiterated previous assurances to industry that the Government would not auction the access rights of existing fishermen in developed fisheries. It also clearly stated that while an auction or tender may be used to allocate new fishing rights, the Government would ensure that appropriate incentives were provided so that exploration for and development of new fisheries would continue. This Bill provides the means by which auctions or tenders can be used to allocate new fishing rights. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>FOREIGN FISHING LICENCES LEVY BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also complements the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 which I presented earlier.The second reading speech of the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 indicated that foreign fishing licences would be fishery specific and would be subject to the payment of fees and levies. The fees and levies can be paid either by means of a formal agreement for access to the Australian fishing zone, or through specific levies imposed when the foreign fishing licence is granted. This Bill provides the mechanism through which the levies associated with foreign fishing licences are paid when there is no formal agreement with overseas governments or commercial interests. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>FISHERIES AGREEMENTS (PAYMENTS) BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also complements the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 which I presented earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>The second reading speech for the Fisheries Management Bill outlined the new system for granting access to the Australian Fishing Zone. In doing this it indicated that the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Act 1981 would be replaced by a new Bill to collect payments from overseas governments or commercial interests for access to the Australian Fishing Zone where formal agreements are in place. This Bill gives effect to this and provides the Australian Fisheries Management Authority with the power to suspend a licence to operate in the Australian Fishing Zone if the amount specified in the access agreement is not paid. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>FISHERIES LEGISLATION (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the companion Bill to the Fisheries Management Bill 1991, which I presented earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill addresses a number of issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly it provides for transitional arrangements as the Fisheries Act 1952 is replaced by the Fisheries Management Bill 1991. In particular it makes provision for the continuation of scientific permits and fishing licences issued under the Fisheries Act 1952 until they expire or are revoked even though most parts of the Fisheries Act 1952 will be repealed. This will give the Australian Fisheries Management Authority a short breathing space during which time the new register of statutory fishing rights, and the procedures for allocating fishing permits can be established. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also continues the arrangements for the sharing of fisheries management responsibilities with the states and Northern Territory which are currently under the Fisheries Act 1952 for a period of two years, after which the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 will take over these matters. This will provide the state and Northern Territory governments with sufficient time to amend their legislation so as to appropriately cross-reference the new Fisheries Management Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Another important provision contained in the Bill concerns the terms and conditions of the staff being transferred to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority from the Australian Fisheries Service. The Bill makes it absolutely clear that staff who are transferred to the new authority at its commencement will continue to be employed on the same terms and conditions and will be subject to the same industrial awards that they are under immediately prior to their transfer until the authority negotiates its own industrial awards. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill also amends the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 in order to implement the changes in fisheries research and development arrangements outlined in the second reading speech of the Fisheries Management Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>That speech explained why the Government is establishing a Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and the bases of the funding arrangements for that corporation. This Bill gives effect to these changes. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a short statement about the response. First, the letter of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), commends the Committee for its efforts and, given Mr Dawkins's response to previous Senate committees, it is a pleasing response from the Minister. The important thing is that the Committee has written a second report, and the Minister is now asking for additional time to respond to that report. Rather than using the adjournment debate, I want to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of honourable senators something that they may not have seen in Parliamentary Patter, produced by the Parliamentary Education Office. It refers to a publication the Australian Constitution, which has been prepared by the Parliamentary Education Office and which is selling in the Parliamentary bookshop for $2.50, and schools can buy class sets of 30 copies for $18 or 60c each. This is a marked improvement on the $7 or $8 for the larger copy, and in this decade of celebration of the centenary of our Constitution now everyone can have a copy. Even you, Mr President, can walk around with one in your coat pocket and you can pull out your Constitution reference book and be fully aware of what clause 125 is all about if someone asks you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw this to the attention of honourable senators and ask them to make their House of Representatives' colleagues aware and to encourage schools and young people to obtain a copy. It is a great concern in this democracy of ours that 52 per cent of people of voting age do not know that we have a Constitution, and this is one way of overcoming this problem. People can have access to this reference book for a mere $2.50 or for 60c for school students. I ask senators to broadcast this information loudly and clearly. We must congratulate the Parliamentary Education Office on yet another innovation, encouraging our community to find out more about the Constitution. Senators Newman, Lees and I, together with 17 other female members of parliament, were having dinner with four female members of the Russian Parliament, and sharing experiences with people like that always makes one aware that one might complain because they have no shoes until they see someone who has no feet. When we see the struggles that some people are going through in establishing democratic processes in their own country we realise how much we undervalue our own, and how sometimes our own press devalues our system. This is a timely reminder of the importance of our democracy and the responsibility that each one of us has here to maintain that democracy and to maintain the integrity of that democracy and that is required by us as elected representatives of that democracy. I commend the little green book to all my colleagues and I hope they will promulgate this information throughout their electorates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on the proposed tax file number provisions and data-matching program, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard and to move a motion in relation to the document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>In its report the Committee concluded by a majority that the present circumstances are such as to justify the use of tax file numbers as proposed in the Bills which were under Committee consideration. The relevant Bills, namely the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990 were subsequently passed by both Houses of Parliament, received Royal Assent and are now operative. </PARA>
<PARA>In its report the Committee noted several matters in respect of which I would like to comment. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the report the Committee discussed the provisions in the Bills requiring certain social security recipients to provide to the Department of Social Security details of tax file numbers belonging to their spouses. The Committee noted the comments of some witnesses to the effect that the requirement would cause problems for some social security recipients, especially those who have been subject to domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation allows for waiver of this requirement by the Secretary to the Department of Social Security where the recipient does not know the spouse's tax file number and the Secretary is satisfied that the recipient could not obtain a statement or declaration relating to the spouse's tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA>I also assured the Committee that the Department of Social Security would be preparing guidelines as to how the Secretary to that Department will exercise his power to waive the spousal tax file number requirement. I further undertook to provide a copy of these guidelines to the Senate Standing Committee when they are available. I can now report that the process of drafting and consultation on the guidelines is almost complete and I expect the guidelines to be finalised by the end of June 1991. Until the guidelines are adopted no social security recipient will be required to provide a spousal tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted in paragraph 20 of the report that the Department of Social Security would not normally require pensioners aged over 80 years to supply a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA>Work is proceeding on defining the circumstances when a tax file number will be required of pensioners aged 80 years or over. Again I expect to have firm proposals put before me by the end of June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>At paragraph 20 of its report the Committee noted the undertaking I gave its members that there would be no interconnection between the data-matching system in the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act and that proposed for the Law Enforcement Access Network (known as LEAN). I confirm this. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted in the same paragraph that the Department of Social Security undertook to endeavour to inform affected recipients of income support payments on how data about them would be used in the data-matching program run under the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act. The Government confirms that this will be done. At present the Department of Social Security is finalising consideration of the most cost-efficient way of doing this. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted also in paragraph 20 that the Department of Social Security would ensure that the Technical Standards Report to be prepared under guideline 4.1 of the Schedule to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act would include details setting out the Privacy Commissioner's responsibilities in the event that the data-matching cycle is interrupted by a computer malfunction. This will be done as will be evident when the Technical Standards Report is published. Guideline 4.2 requires production of a draft Technical Standards Report by 31 March 1991 with a final version due by 30 June 1991. The draft was provided to interested parties at the end of March. </PARA>
<PARA>At paragraphs 23 to 26 of its report the Committee referred to a letter to it from the Privacy Commissioner in which he suggested a change to a provision of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. This would have changed a proposed amendment to an objects clause, paragraph 202 (e), of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that the use of tax file numbers contemplated by the relevant clause in the Bill would be narrowed further. The Committee recommended an amendment along lines proposed by the Privacy Commissioner. This proposal was acceptable to the Government but in the time available it was not possible to present an agreed amendment to Parliament. Since then a draft amendment satisfactory to all the interested parties has been settled and will be presented to Parliament at the earliest opportunity. The amendment will operate retrospectively to 1 January 1991 if the legislation is passed. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Government I thank the Committee for its report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990 is to provide for regulation of the education export industry with respect to the marketing and provision of education services to the overseas student market through the registration of institutions and the regulation of handling of moneys received from overseas students. In recent years the Government has got this whole area in a huge mess. It thought that the best way to handle that mess was to bring forward some further provisions in this Bill, but that was in an even bigger mess. As a result, some consultations have been pushed upon the Government. As a result of those consultations, the Government has brought forward a great list of amendments. It was still inadequate, and the measure was forwarded to a Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That committee brought forward a great number of amendments, in a very important report that is presently before us in the chamber. It was still not satisfactory and the Opposition then brought forward further recommendations, and I am in great heart because I see that, at the end of this evening, we will have all those amendments in place, and this will enormously change the Bill as originally conceived by the Government. We will then have some means to hope that we will come through this process with those educational institutions that are providing for overseas students in some good heart. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the change in visa procedures in the latter half of 1989, overseas students usually prepaid tuition fees and living expenses to Australian institutions. It would appear that these institutions were under no obligation to separate these prepayments from other funds and generally did not do so. However, there were usually contracts with overseas students providing that if a student failed to secure a visa, the moneys paid, less a registration fee, would be refunded to the student. </PARA>
<PARA> In the wake of events in Tiananmen Square and Beijing two years ago, the processing of visas ceased for several months. At this time a backlog of 26,000 had already developed. Consequently, several months elapsed between the time the overseas student paid fees to the institution and when that student's visa application was processed. In the interim, another turn of the screw: visa processing procedures, which had been irresponsibly loose under this Government, were eventually greatly tightened. One of the new requirements was that overseas students not prepay fees until such a time as their visa application had been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, during the period when visa processing ceased, it is alleged that Australian institutions accepted prepayments from an additional 12,000 overseas students. When the visa processing recommenced, the new visa processing procedures resulted in a visa rejection rate of 35 per cent with respect to 26,000 students and a rejection rate of 45 per cent for the 12,000 students. Institutions were thus obligated to commence refunding fees to these students who had prepaid their fees and then had their visa applications rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Many institutions, not anticipating these major changes in government administration of this matter, had already spent the funds provided by these backlogged students in anticipation of a continuation of the spectacular growth in the industry. Furthermore, institutions were not receiving any funds for new visa applicants. Indeed, after the processing of the backlog, visa regulations were further tightened to the extent that the rejection rate rose to 94 per cent-nearly all of them rejected-from the People's Republic of China. And we have had other debates about the way the Government mishandled students from overseas and from China in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The twin factors of the unforeseen need to refund significant amounts of money and the unforeseen decline in revenue inflows meant that many institutions were unable to refund these moneys and several colleges actually went into liquidation. Many of the education institutions went broke and the money was still owed to overseas students, many of whom had not even left their own home country. The Government has stepped in, in an attempt to solve the mess it created, by refunding these moneys through introducing the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill, and this has facilitated at least some of those refunds. </PARA>
<PARA> The contents of the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill attempt to address the two problems that emerged during these events that I have rehearsed: firstly, the past improprieties of the providers and, secondly, the unsatisfactory handling of funds received. This is where the Government thinks that because there has been a mess, which it caused, the best approach is to bring down regulations on every educational institution so that such moneys received are handled in a watertight way for refund to students. </PARA>
<PARA> More than half the education institutions, which have recorded no misdemeanours, no defaulting on repayments, now have to subscribe to extra regulations, rules and requirements to do the job they have already been doing. That is a huge impediment to the good performers in the industry. That is why we have looked with all the more carefulness at the Government's intention in the legislation and why we have sought to remove many of those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Party coalition opposed the Bill in the House of Representatives on the grounds that the requirements for trust accounts, audited quarterly returns and insurance were all excessive. They were draconian and ignored industry schemes coming into place, that is, self-discipline by the education institutions. Also, the Commonwealth had handed regulation of the industry over to the States and was now seeking to re-enter the field without consultation so it could be seen to be doing something. </PARA>
<PARA> The phrase `doing something' is the Government's excuse for creating this further mess to overcome the original mess. The States do not like being interfered with when they believe they have already provided for the good conduct of education within New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia or wherever. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the Bill unduly restricted the ability of providers to explore the market for the services they might be prepared to offer. It put a brake on them going to another country to see what possible students would enrol in their institution. Also, the rights of institutions to withdraw money from the trust accounts was to be determined by future regulations and might override contracts between the institution and the student. Regulations may be costly and commercially impracticable. </PARA>
<PARA> It was discriminatory also in that it conferred on overseas students but not on Australian students an entitlement to refunds if they withdrew, for any reason, from their course; there was no entitlement to the Australian student if he or she withdrew from the same course. The Opposition rejects legislation in the Parliament that discriminates against Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> In providing for refunds, it also failed to adequately account for the type of parties who enter into contracts with institutions. Further, the Bill contained a major drafting error, as a result of which it applied to every provider of education services whether or not they provided courses to overseas students. So following the Opposition's criticism the Bill was referred to the first meeting of the National Consultative Committee on Export of Education and Training Services on 19 December 1990. This Committee happened to agree with all of the Opposition's criticism of the Bill. This Committee included State government representatives and representatives of peak industry provider bodies, together with officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. At the end of the discussions, DEET officers indicated that a lot of amendments would need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of this year the Government introduced six amendments to the Bill, which we will come to in the committee stage. The Opposition called for these and supports all six. But they only went some small part of the way to meet the necessary requirements. The Government amendments are principally designed to meet State objections that, having handed responsibility for regulation of the industry to the States, the Bill would then operate to force the States from the field. They also allow exemption of certain providers from the regulations to meet objections mainly from the universities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also made available draft regulations that would operate under this new law but these draft regulations were only published on the very day that the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training met and none of the witnesses-and senators who were asking questions, including myself-had seen those regulations. So we were at a huge disadvantage. This has typified the Government's lack of courtesy and orderliness in its conduct of this matter in the past six months. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. We have in the chamber my colleagues Senator Tierney and Senator Crane, who served very capably on that Senate inquiry, and Senator Calvert. As a result, we have the report, to which I have referred, which brought down enormous criticism of the Bill, and 13 additional specific amendments, which were seen as necessary by not only my colleagues in the Opposition but also Government and Democrat senators. In fact, this very sensible committee inquiry alluded to even further defects. This led us in the Opposition to want to put forward even further amendments, which we are doing tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to commend my three colleagues in the Opposition for the conscientiousness with which they went about that committee work; the way they contacted the industry; the way they listened carefully; and the way they tried to sort out the mess that this Government had placed the industry in by this pending legislation. In their remarks shortly, I know that Senators Tierney and Crane will refer to the Committee's report. So I do not have a need to refer to that any further. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, I was going to outline the six specific Government amendments but, owing to the restrictions on time, I will skip that part of my speech. I have already broadly described them as responding to that meeting in December and to the Opposition's remarks in the House of Representatives last year. The Committee amendments are 13 in number. Let me give the Senate four of the amendments. One of them redefines the word `course' to correct the effect of the drafting error by limiting courses to `courses of education and training provided to overseas students'. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation replaces the schedule of exempt providers with a schedule exempting classes of providers. For example, it has always been my contention that this law should not affect any primary or secondary school in Australia. I am happy to see that by exempting a class, that is, all secondary schools, we will not make them liable to all the penalties, regulations and requirements that are set out in this new legislation. Another outcome from the Committee's work was to replace the concept of `trust accounts' that are in the Bill as it is before us now with `special accounts', thus removing the ambiguity surrounding the term `trust'. What is needed is not in fact what in law is termed a trust account. Another amendment alters the conditions applying to the withdrawal of funds from the special accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, the Committee's work supported the thrust of the Opposition's arguments and seeks, by its amendments, to make the Bill less regulatory. These amendments look more for self-discipline rather than for discipline by Commonwealth Government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to this point-whether Government amendments or the so-called Committee amendments, that is, the six amendments and the 13-while meeting some of our objections to the original Bill do not address the concerns raised about the commercial practicability and equity of the proposed legislation. The oppressive provisions relating to financial arrangements and the inequity, to which the Bill gives rise between Australian and overseas students, still remains. Consequently, the Government amendments and even the Committee amendments do not go far enough to lead us to alter our inclination to oppose the Bill. However, I will come to that in my conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issue that remains is that we do not have a satisfactory legal regulatory framework within which the education export industry, including those institutions concerned with teaching the English language, can develop. A satisfactory framework would encourage, not inhibit, the development of an internationally competitive industry in Australia. The current proposed legislation results primarily from the Government's desire to be seen to be doing something. It is not good enough to lay all these regulations on all educational institutions alike, that is, on those which are blameless and which have been fully performing. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to refer to the September 1990 report-available for nine months now-entitled Report on the Future Operations of the Non-Formal Export Education Industry by Tony Harris, the special adviser to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). I can only say that his findings support the thrust of my remarks and the Opposition's approach to this matter. Let me quote just one part of his report:</PARA>
<PARA>Regulation is also expensive to the taxpayer and to the institutions, can relieve overseas students from the obligation to act prudently in the way they deal with institutions, and can cause governments to intervene in the marketplace in order to validate past approval decisions. Regulatory regimes can be used to limit entry to the industry and thus reduce competition, innovation or growth.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the thrust of that report nine months ago and it was even commissioned by the Government. As a result, the Opposition was still to be convinced-until events that have happened in the last 24 hours-to even see this legislation remain permanently on the statute book. </PARA>
<PARA> I move quickly on to refer to Australia's competitiveness internationally. What is the situation in the United Kingdom, in the United States, in Canada or in any of the countries that are receiving overseas students? They do not have these regulations. They do not have such a Bill as we are debating here tonight. Why should we in Australia put our education providers at a disadvantage internationally?</PARA>
<PARA> I come now to refer to the three Opposition amendments. First of all, we are not happy about the requirement that there be insurance taken out, according to the definitions that the Government has imposed. In due course at the committee stage, we will move an amendment to that part which will, nevertheless, be satisfactory to ensure that the moneys are not at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we believe that quarterly auditing of accounts in these institutions-unheard of in other companies-is excessive. We will move to have annual audits unless there is reasonable cause to call for a shorter period for regular auditing. Finally-and this is the Opposition's main contention-we seek to place in the legislation a sunset clause so that the whole legislation collapses on the first day of January 1994, unless it has been repealed before that time. That is the critical matter, as far as the Opposition is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Even with all of the amendments that we have been able to gain in this legislation, we do not want to see this as anything other than as a transition out of the mess that the Government has brought upon itself. We do not want to put any permanent disadvantage upon the Australian education providers with regard to overseas students. In the committee stage we will seek to introduce a sunset clause which will mean that the legislation ceases to have effect from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> In my final remarks on this Bill I wish to refer to the important Industry Commission report that was published only two days ago. One would have to ask whether the Government's right hand knows what the left hand is doing. We have the Minister for Employment, Education and Training saying that this is urgent education export legislation which must be passed and the former Treasurer, former Deputy Prime Minister Keating, has commissioned the Industry Commission to look at education exports. This report has come down only two days ago, on 4 June, and it has not been taken into consideration by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training as having any relevance to this legislation, which is to govern all education exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical thing is that the industry report is entirely supportive of the thrust of the Opposition's approach to this matter and is directly critical of the Government. This has been a most important report in a critical week and it has come two days before this Senate debate. I point out to the Senate a couple of the references that it makes. On page 2 in the overview in this report there is a blast at the Government and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Government regulation of this industry, since its beginnings in 1986, has been characterised by sudden shifts in policy direction, the effects of which have been made more serious by the way in which decisions were reached and subsequently communicated to those directly affected . . . when the brakes were put on, the policy stance changed abruptly from one which was fairly relaxed to one which some say is now too strict and poorly targeted. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's reaction to the problems in the industry-</PARA>
<PARA>the $50m it had to refund to students in China alone-</PARA>
<PARA>was to attempt to tighten up immigration rules, and to place greater controls on educational institutions. Some say that too many changes were introduced, and that there was insufficient consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also a blast on page 3 at the Government's requirement in the first place for prepayment of fees. There is also a direct criticism on page 4 of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and its conduct. The most important part of the report is on page 5, where it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The registration and accreditation requirements imposed on institutions are placing unnecessary burdens on the better institutions, both formal and non-formal, in an attempt to solve problems among a few providers in the non-formal sector. </PARA>
<PARA>It also says that these institutions have not been properly consulted. It then refers directly to the Bill that is before us. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is reason to doubt that quality can be, or indeed, should be, regulated in this way. Regulating inputs can never guarantee output quality, and it is a costly process. It may also constrain innovative course design and act as a barrier to competition. Most importantly, it appears to overseas students that accreditation has given an institution a `stamp of approval' from the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>So I could go on. Toward the end of the report from the Industry Commission there is direct support for Opposition policy which would make Australian students able to gain the benefits that the overseas students have. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that on the day this report came out, just two days ago, the Australian Financial Review carried an editorial with the headline `IC lashes Govt on export policy'. It has a very quizzical cartoon of Mr Dawkins, the Minister, who has been stymied by this report. The Canberra Times carried a report entitled `Education for export: draft report calls for reforms'. Again, it is scathing of the Government, scathing of the way in which the Government is proceeding in this matter. The Australian carried a similar report, saying that it restricted the growth of worthy providers in a new industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to refer to the statement made by my colleague Dr Kemp, the Opposition education spokesman in the House of Representatives, but he made it entirely clear that he welcomed the Industry Commission report on behalf of the Opposition and that it directly confirmed the stance that we were taking in this legislation. Not so Minister Bolkus in this chamber when two days ago, in answer to a question from Senator Tierney, he said that everything was on track and the Government was proceeding as usual. </PARA>
<PARA> We now come to the past 24 hours, when the Government completely collapsed regarding this legislation. The Government agreed to all of the Opposition amendments: agreed to the sunset clause; agreed to taking out the onerous restrictions on insurance and on quarterly accounting. I can only say that the Government is at last having a sensible day in which it has seen the merit of the argument and that it does not want to live with this legislation one day longer than is necessary, given the weight of argument that has been put by this Senate in committee, by the Opposition in the Parliament, by the industry itself and, indeed, by the Industry Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past 24 hours Mr Dawkins has given a direct assurance that all of the Opposition amendments that remain will be directly accepted by the Government. I regard this complete remaking of this legislation as a victory for maintaining a careful legislative process in this Parliament, for maintaining the Senate committee system. I regard this outcome as a victory for the Senate, a victory for the Senate committee system and, by the way, a victory for the Opposition. Most importantly-I see Senator Tate smiling with approval that so many Australians have benefited from my remarks-it is of considerable benefit to the education institutions themselves and to the whole of this important industry that it is not only serving Australia well but also serving overseas students from many countries who come to gain qualifications in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to establish a register of those institutions and individuals approved to provide educational services for overseas students and to require those providing courses to comply with a number of conditions. The coalition initially opposed this Bill in the House of Representatives for a number of reasons. Regulations may be costly and commercially impracticable. The requirement for trust accounts, audited quarterly returns and insurance was excessive and draconian. The right of institutions to withdraw money from the trust accounts was deemed by future regulations and might override contracts between the institutions and the students. In addition, it might not provide sufficient protection for student funds, depending on the signatory arrangements. It was discriminatory in that it conferred on overseas students, but not on Australian students, an entitlement to refunds if they withdrew for any reason from their course. In providing for refunds, it failed to account adequately for the types of parties who entered into contracts with institutions. The Bill contained a major drafting error, as a result of which it applied to every provider of educational services, irrespective of whether they provided courses to overseas students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's six amendments met some of the Opposition's objections to the original Bill, but they did not address our concerns about the commercial impracticability and equity of the proposed legislation. There still persists the oppressive nature of the provisions related to financial arrangements. There still persists inequity between the Australian students and overseas students concerning the refund of fees. There does not appear to be any proposal at the present time to address the inequity with respect to refunds for overseas and Australian students. The Bill accords more protection to overseas students than has ever been accorded to those in Australia. The key issue remains the need to ensure that there is a satisfactory legal regulatory framework within which the educational export industry, including the teaching of English language, can develop. We need to encourage, not inhibit, a competitive education industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This point of view was supported by the Report on the Future Operations of the Non-formal Export Education Industry by Tony Harris, which the Government received in September 1990. The report noted that there was a general view in the private and public sectors of the industry that existing government policies were damaging the international competitiveness of Australian institutions and that the additional cost burdens imposed by this legislation would make the problem worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The report made a comparison with the United Kingdom, where there is no specific regulation of the providers of educational services to overseas students. The industry there is governed by the general laws relating to companies and commercial practice. The existing private sector providers are also unhappy with the legislation and, in particular, with the competitive advantage that will be given to public sector institutions through the exemption of the latter from the financial arrangement provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the main outstanding concerns of the Association of Recognised ELICOS Centres at this stage were the auditing and reporting requirements on the special accounts; the cash flow problems that are likely to be caused to providers by the regime of regulation of withdrawals; the unequal protection provided to overseas students as against Australian students; and the absence of any apparent Commonwealth intention to move to deregulate the education environment according to the recommendations of the Harris report. Additionally, the Association does not believe that the rolling back provisions of the Government amendments address its concerns with the Bill, as the Bill will apply where there is no State or Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of all these concerns, the Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which reported to the Senate in May. As a result of its deliberations, 13 amendments will be moved to the Bill in the committee stage. The key amendments include changes to provisions for trust accounts and insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The original Bill highlighted trust accounts, but as defined in the Bill they were not true trust accounts. The Committee was advised that only one signature-that is, the signature of the provider-was required. The provider could still take the money and run, so the Bill which was intended to protect student funds was not achieving that in the provision for trust accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The first major amendment of the Standing Committee changed the trust account to a special account which is defined as a separate account for holding funds in trust. However, it is not known at present what amendments might be made to the provisions governing withdrawals from the special accounts. The Opposition is still gravely concerned about these withdrawal provisions. We are concerned about whether there will be adequate protection for student funds in the future regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other main amendment proposed to include bond arrangements as an alternative to insurance. This is still a matter of major concern. The Department of Employment, Education and Training was unable to provide adequate advice to the Senate Standing Committee on the likely cost of insurance or bond arrangements to providers, particularly those not attached to any association. The expense could be onerous on companies trying to establish themselves initially in the industry. Some providers are unsure whether they will be able to find an insurer. The risk factor is very likely to prevent new classes of providers, in particular, from obtaining insurance coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition proposed two further recommendations to the Senate Standing Committee. The Committee rejected these recommendations, and the Opposition will be moving them as separate amendments during the committee stage. One of these amendments relates to the requirement for quarterly returns. The Opposition will be seeking to change the requirement for quarterly returns to an annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will move a further amendment to clause 8 (4) so that, if there is a concern about a particular provider following an examination of annual reports by the Minister, he may then obtain further information about the return. This clause will also allow the Minister to obtain information about returns more frequently if it is thought to be necessary. The other amendment is for a sunset clause in line with the recommendations of the Harris report. The Opposition will be introducing an amendment to the Act to cease operation on 1 January 1994. The reason for doing this will be outlined later when I move the amendment in the committee stage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The more I read this Bill and the more I deliberated on what happened in the Committee, the more I became convinced that the Bill should be withdrawn. But, if the amendments that we have moved are accepted, the Opposition is prepared to support the amended legislation. What we have before us is a piece of legislation which has passed through the House of Representatives and is in its initial stage in the Senate but which is hasty and ill-conceived. It is a short Bill; it is not very complicated or complex. It has 17 clauses on roughly eight pages. Yet the Government had to make six amendments to five of the clauses and had to introduce a new clause before the Bill came into the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, 13 more amendments were proposed to eight clauses. On top of this, the Opposition will be moving nine amendments, and there are likely to be other amendments coming forward as well. Even if these amendments are passed today, there are still serious problems with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the tardiness and the inadequacy of the advice from the Department, there are still unanswered questions on key aspects of this Bill. There are still unanswered questions relating to the operation of special accounts and the protection of student funds. There are still unanswered questions relating to the cost of insurance or bond arrangements. The Bill also violates one of the more important rights in law. In some of its provisions, there is a reversal of onus of proof by assuming the parties to be guilty until proved innocent. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a Bill of which the Government can be proud. Even with all our bandaids, which have patched up the Bill into some sort of respectability, there are still many unsolved problems. In light of the Industry Commission report on the export of education services, the Bill should be revised severely. The Government should carefully draft a new Bill for the education export industry based on the findings of its own Industry Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the amazing situation where, at the same time as this legislation was in the Senate, the Government's Industry Commission was inquiring into the whole education export industry and was not due to finalise its report until the end of July. It is perhaps typical of this Labor Government that two Ministers and two government departments should be moving in exactly opposite directions, the ex-Treasurer Mr Keating and the Department of the Treasury moving to deregulate institutions and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) imposing more and more regulations on higher education and other educational services. One Minister moves to rush through a hastily drafted Bill on the export of education services, and the Treasurer gives a reference to his Industry Commission to inquire into the whole matter and make a final report by the end of July. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission released a draft report two days ago, and it represents a significant victory for the export of education industry. The Opposition welcomes the report because it supports our concern about the Government's handling of educational exports. Government regulation, which has grown at an enormous pace during the past few years, is affected by sudden shifts in policy direction, the effects of which have been made more serious by the way in which decisions have been reached and subsequently communicated to those directly affected in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the main findings of the draft report of the Industry Commission are as follows. Government actions are impeding the efficient development of the export of education. An industry which is now worth up to $1.2 billion a year in exports has suffered at the hand of an over-zealous Government. Government policies have encouraged abuse by students and institutions in the educational sector and restricted the growth of worthy providers in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Industry Commission agrees with our worries that a rigid regulation of higher education is limiting Australia's capacity to compete in the world market of educational services. It is therefore necessary to make significant amendments to this Bill to protect the long term viability of this important education export industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill was hastily conceived, and indeed conceived in a particularly disastrous situation in the Australian industry. The format in which the Bill came to the Senate had already been rejected by the Opposition in the lower House, which is not surprising. What has now reached us in this chamber should be examined very closely-certainly by overseas students for whom we presume it was devised. I feel that it is necessary to warn overseas students that this legislation does not guarantee their education or their financial investment, nor does it improve the quality of the service in the national education sector. It should be emphasised that it does not guarantee an improvement in the quality of the education service which is to be delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has admitted that a lack of effective regulation has caused many of the problems which have occurred in this area. Australia at the moment has an appalling reputation in the export of education. There are continuing problems which include false advertising, poor quality teaching and support, as well as fraud, theft, sexual abuse, non-attendance, overstays, collapses and non-payment of refunds. Those experiences, combined with a lack of government regulation, erratic changes in policy and exorbitant costs, have created a deserved reputation of exploitation rather than goodwill. Australia is already losing its tiny share-less than 5 per cent-of the world market for overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA> It was of particular concern to me during the legislation committee hearings to hear from expert witnesses that we are losing our tiny share of the world market for overseas students, but that fact was challenged. One witness was embarrassed by the grilling he received from one of our committee members to such an extent that extra information needed to be provided after the committee hearing. I think that it was particularly embarrassing that the facts which were presented to our committee were not welcomed by some of the committee members. In fact, it was almost a case of one committee member being unwilling to hear those facts. That is an embarrassment that we as a country have to carry-the fact that our reputation is such that people are walking away, voting with their feet, and are certainly not taking advantage of our education provision. We have become uncompetitive. We are a country with one of the most stringent, expensive and complicated sets of entry and admission requirements in the world, but when we have the opportunity to deliver our education provision we do not have the reputation of being able to provide it in an equitable and satisfactory manner. </PARA>
<PARA> In its publication Second Opinion, a recent report by the Overseas Students, Graduates and Nurses Association of Australia (OSGNAA) claims that Australia has become one of the three most expensive countries offering courses overseas. It has been suggested that the Government's `full fees' are inflated by some providers by up to 200 per cent. According to OSGNAA, the basic fee for an overseas student has gone from $1500 per year in 1979 to over $10,000 today, with some courses demanding an incredible $25,000 a year. There are very few scholarships for students from Third World countries, so Australian education is becoming increasingly elitist. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition opposed this Bill in the lower House, but the Australian Democrats agree with students and providers that some Federal regulation is better than none. As has been described already, an attempt at bandaiding was made through the committee. The negotiations continued, with attempts at amendments past that time. The Australian Democrats requested initially that this Bill be referred to a committee in the hope that that would at least bring some sense to it in anticipation that the Government already had a considerable number of its own amendments. We were insistent that this matter go to a committee mainly because of complaints about the lack of consultation in the formulation of this legislation, and also the threat of duplication of State and industry regulation that already existed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's amendments and those proposed by the Senate committee tackled some of the problems that occurred in the original Bill, but this legislation still fails to achieve its stated aims, and is still too limited in scope. The current Bill represented an important opportunity to begin to get things right. But it was unfortunate that this legislation was drafted so quickly. It is amazing that since its drafting process, we have had a lot more time for the consultation that should have occurred initially to occur now. It seems that its urgency has been somewhat dissipated by other events, or perhaps it is because of the continued embarrassment of having such a Bill before us that it has been delayed so often. </PARA>
<PARA> That delay is particularly curious, given that the Federal Government's Industry Commission was asked in December 1990 to report on this whole area by the end of July. It was found to be a massive undertaking. What we have so far is a draft report which was received on 4 June, and the final report is not likely to reach us until August. Even so, I would suggest that that has not been made with full consultation, and the Industry Commission itself has found the task considerable. We had a hastily prepared Bill, and a hiatus between preparation and presentation here. Also we have had a coincidental report-indeed it is an amazing coincidence-prepared by another body. That other body, the Industry Commission, has rightly found a mishmash caused by the lack of regulation in this area. The Industry Commission's draft report was presented, as I said, on 4 June. The examination brought to the matter by the Australian Democrats in the time available has led us to regret the fact that the draft recommendations tend towards favouring less regulation rather than more regulation, which we believe is required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has a narrow and limited view of the sector in terms of economic benefits to Australia, and the issue of possible displacement of Australian students seems to be of prime concern to the Commission. Traditionally-a tradition with which the Democrats identify-the provision of education to overseas students has involved cultural and educational exchange. But we see here emphasis on the economic benefits coming to Australia-an emphasis that I believe is undue and quite rude, which I think is the most suitable word to use in this context. It is rude to those from whom we ourselves can derive some cultural benefits, and it is rude to those who may be providing the opportunity for cultural and educational interchange. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not necessarily true that the money and the benefits to Australia should be paramount, but that is what we see as a flavour not only of this legislation but also of the Industry Commission's draft report. We believe that the goodwill and economic benefits to less well developed countries in the region should be taken into account. It is regrettable-actually, it is appalling-that on page 99 the Industry Commission's draft report states:</PARA>
<PARA>the objectives of ensuring the quality of courses, the safety of the students' investment and the financial viability of the institutions they attend are ``impossible to satisfy'' . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what has been said in the draft report-the quality of the courses is impossible to satisfy. I would have thought that quality would have been paramount in our consideration of what we sell overseas. This is an export industry. We are being told by one of the bodies associated with surveying this that such a consideration is impossible to satisfy. </PARA>
<PARA> With that in mind, I am very pleased that this legislation is going through this place before we get a chance to consider the final report. That is an irony. In many cases it is nonsense that we have to consider the legislation while another government body is reviewing the area, but here I am saying that it is a relief that it is happening before those recommendations come down because if that is the style of the recommendations-that it is impossible to satisfy the consideration of quality-I would not be endorsing the Commission's report. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of the Commission's recommendations which the Democrats happily support, however, are for greater consultation about changes in policy and better information to students. I would have thought that that would be common sense anyway, so I quite happily support it. However, it is a nonsense for the Commission to suggest that information with minimal regulation replaces the need to ensure the quality of Australia's educational services. In a media release of November 1990, the Minister stated that it would `provide Australia's multi-million dollar export education industry with a solid base for its future operation'. According to that press release, Mr Dawkins `indicated that there was an urgency in preparing legislation to protect students and the integrity of the industry'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right. The irony that I see there is that the aims of Mr Dawkins at that time seem at odds with the sorts of recommendations that the Industry Commission seems to think are not possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has claimed that the current Bill does two things to lift standards and to protect students. In the Sydney Morning Herald dated 17 April 1991, Mr Dawkins-during a rescue mission to China-is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation will require institutions to gain Commonwealth registration before recruiting overseas and will make it mandatory for fees to be placed in trust funds. </PARA>
<PARA>On the first point, Mr Dawkins stated in his second reading speech that a formal register of institutions and courses means that `students will only be granted a visa for travel to Australia for study purposes if they are accepted for registered courses in registered institutions'. However, this new register merely formalises or replaces the current record kept by his Department. Registration, in that sense, simply means re-listing all State approved institutions and courses. It is, therefore, based on the current diverse and flawed systems of accreditation and monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence, including submissions to the Senate committee, that the States have continued to admit unfit and shady operators. This is the sort of thing that this legislation was intended to prevent but, from what I have just said, it undoubtedly does not have the capacity to do so. The States have also failed to monitor the provision of the approved courses, staff and facilities and to investigate documented complaints about several colleges, many of which have collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, according to the Minister, the current Bill requires all providers to maintain trust accounts for overseas students' funds and to guarantee refunds from those accounts. However, contrary to the Minister's assurances, money advanced by students will not be held in trust accounts. Yet, that is what the Minister said in a press release when he went to China to explain what was going on. I suggest that the very mention of that word `trust' while that trip was going on is misleading and gives a false impression of what will eventually occur under this legislation. What will eventually occur under this legislation is not as the Minister described. This is the sort of misleading information which adds to, and is the very basic reason for, Australia's loss of reputation in this area. That is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats reject the use of the term `trust' because its use in this regard is false and misleading. We protest at its use by the Minister in trying to reassure our overseas neighbours. Its incorrect use was acknowledged by the Attorney-General's Department in a letter to the Department of Employment, Education and Training, dated 16 November 1990. The Senate committee has proposed that the term be changed to `a special account'. The Industry Commission itself also notes that the trust account proposed in the current Bill does not involve the trustee-agent relationship in law, so it really should never be referred to again as a `trust account'. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 118 of the draft report of the Industry Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA>the funds accounted for still belong to the institution, and would be lost to the student in the event of a collapse. </PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA>Thus protection relies on the legal requirement that institutions enter into insurance or other arrangements satisfactory to the Government to protect students' funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Insurance is difficult to obtain and where available, expensive. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the term `where available' because that was something that many witnesses who appeared before the committee had not been able to resolve. I wonder where it is available. The report also suggests that other arrangements, whatever they might be, are also likely to be complex and expensive. I object to the cavalier manner in which the committee was advised that insurance or other arrangements would be able to be obtained. Those who operate in the industry have not found such to be the case. In fact, so far, no insurer has been keen to offer insurance of any description to any of the colleges offering English language intensive courses for overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were serious about protecting students' funds, it would have considered the suggestion of a central fidelity fund as a standard, relatively straightforward safety net found in many trades and professions. Instead, this was wafted off into an ill-defined `other arrangements' suggestion. Students who appeared before the Senate committee suggested that the establishment of a contingency fund could be a security against default. Solicitors, real estate agents, builders and many other industry and professional groups have similar safeguards, but we were left without guidance from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Students have also suggested that the interest on the moneys held in special accounts could go into a fund to guarantee refunds and perhaps provide loans to students if necessary. Witnesses made many valuable suggestions at our committee hearings but it was difficult to translate some of those valuable suggestions into legislation-firstly, because the legislation itself was clumsy and, secondly, because the preparers of the legislation were not keen to tamper with what they saw as a valuable document. I think what has been said already illustrates that the value of this document was really only as a very shaky foundation for an overwhelming number of suggested amendments which will come from the committee itself, from the coalition, from the Democrats and some of which should have come from the Government before that. Quite frankly, I am unsure as to what we will end up with because the hotchpotch of amendments and original legislation is really quite difficult to comprehend. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Department in a letter to the Department dated 16 November 1990 suggests that the regulations could make provision for the disposition of interest. Interest seemed to be a matter of some contention to members of the committee, students and the providers. The issue of interest, how it was to be administered and the fiduciary requirements of the providers were matters of some concern. Under this current set-up, providers would be subject to three sets of fiduciary requirements-Federal, State and industry. It is most confusing-even the legal advisers seemed confused-and I wonder whether it will be clear to providers as to what their actual obligations are and whether it will be clear to students as to what their own rights and obligations should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely that is a central point: somebody undertaking study in an overseas country and paying a considerable amount of money to do so should be able to determine, fairly easily and in simple straightforward language, what his or her rights and obligations are under the various circumstances which could arise while studying overseas. That is not the case with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance of separate accounts, provision for quarterly audits, and the guarantee and payment of refunds are limited to private providers and do not necessarily apply to government institutions which are exempted from many other things. An exemption list, which comprises all government-funded schools and tertiary institutions-a total of 460- runs to 13 pages in a schedule to the draft regulations. It is an absurdity in legislation which applies only to the export education program. It cannot be paralleled in other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Private providers, including non-profit organisations, have complained about being targeted by this legislation. It seems ludicrous that government-funded institutions are not examined for quality, equity or reliability. I do not want to suggest that government organisations may collapse, go broke and keep students' money, but I suggest that there may be some doubt about the capacity of all 460 institutions to deliver a quality product, a product worthy of export. </PARA>
<PARA> The private providers argue that the costs involved place them at a significant commercial disadvantage compared with public institutions. Without agreeing or disagreeing with that claim, one can understand why it is made. While similar financial backup may not be necessary, there is evidence that many public institutions do require greater regulation and monitoring. Criticisms about false marketing, poor quality teaching and courses, and a lack of facilities and support have been levelled at mainstream universities and technical and further education colleges as well as at private colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that in this legislation `refund' refers only to tuition fees. Up to 50 per cent of forward paid moneys, including compulsory prepayment of accommodation and a living allowance, make up a sort of `bring your own' Austudy at substandard rates. This sort of thing really must be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent closure of Buckland College in Western Australia was the latest in a line of 17 collapses in less than a year-15 apparently within five months. The Buckland collapse sent nervous colleges scrambling to accommodate the students who came from that place. This Bill does not include any provision for transfer to a similar course without additional fees. That would be a good option if refunds were unavailable. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia could have become a well-respected learning centre in the Asia-Pacific region. Instead, our reputation now is appalling. I cannot see that this legislation, nor the current actions of the Minister, can lead to any ameliorating of that position. A concerted rescue effort requires a properly coordinated national approach. Students and providers support such a concept and the States all agree in principle about the necessary controls-although they have yet to deliver and prove that they agree by taking some action to bring about agreement on a code, method of conduct or provision of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats really do not share the glee of Senator Teague at this passage of legislation. With or without amendments, we are not convinced that what is promised or what is necessary can be provided through this legislation. We have attempted to amend it and we have contributed significantly to the plethora of amendments which honourable senators will find on their desks. Nevertheless, we feel it is necessary to ask the Minister to give his assurance that future development of the export education program will be properly coordinated and will be within a national regulatory framework. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be suggesting the inclusion of a nationally recognised code of conduct. Our amendments include a code which has the imprimatur of the Australian Education Council-the only body which could be considered to have in mind the interests of all national providers in this area. We have attempted, and we will continue to attempt, through our amendments to include a code of conduct from that body and ask that that be included in the legislation. We ask that this legislation not be considered the final result. We think it is necessary to tackle this issue again because the way in which it has been tackled so far leaves a lot to be desired. </PARA>

It seems quite ridiculous to me that the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990 has been thrown at us in haste. I think there are eight pages to the Bill, yet we had to have 35 amendments in one form or another. I think that says it all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As Senator Teague says, it certainly was a mess. The observation that I want to make tonight in the few short moments that I am talking relates to the innovative concept that the Senate has involved itself in by referring Bills to committees. I am a member of three committees-one select committee and two standing committees. This was the first time that a Bill has been referred to a committee of which I have been a member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the point that, warts and all, at least we have had the opportunity to take evidence from people in the industry. I believe that because we had people on the Committee like Senator Bell, an ex-school teacher at the Friend School in Hobart, and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, an ex-Minister for Education in Tasmania, we were able to get views from the industry itself and interpret those views into queries as to what the Government and Mr Dawkins have been trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember very well, for instance, evidence from Mr Fergus Thomson from the National Council of Independent Schools Association. He was very concerned about the over-regulation involved in the original concept in the Bill and he suggested it would break the industry. That message came as well from Jack Evans, a former Democrat senator from Western Australia. So I am giving the system a pat on the back because I believe that the system of referring selected Bills to committees has allowed this Parliament to involve people in decisions that have been made by the Parliament. That is something that we should remember. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably the biggest innovation that has occurred in this place for many, many years. It has certainly caused complications. As Chairman of the Committee, you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we have had many meetings. There has been to-ing and fro-ing to the Minister on many occasions but I am pleased that, in the end, Mr Dawkins has seen common sense and has accepted not only the concerns of the Democrats but also, in the final analysis, our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to compliment all the members of the Committee. I am looking forward to involving myself in committee work next week on a different subject. I certainly compliment the Deputy Chairman of the Committee and my colleague Senator Tierney, a new senator, for the involvement and work that he has put into this particular Bill. His former role and position in education has been an asset, as has Senator Bell's former expertise in education. For a couple of bushrangers like Senator Crane and me, it has certainly been an education to see how the system works and to put across our point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, I think that common sense has prevailed. I hope that the Democrats support our amendments and that this Bill passes without too much more fuss and bother. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990. There are a few points that I would like to bring out. Most of what has needed to be said has been said. I would just like to emphasise a few points. One must comment on how unsatisfactory and what a mess this Bill was when first it came to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. A couple of months or so ago, when it first came before us, Mr Dawkins was going overseas and he put a lot of emphasis on the importance of it at that particular time. I believe he was just looking for a comfort zone when he went over there so that he could say that he was doing something about it. Of course, we were presented with what can only be described as a mess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of the witnesses who came before us pointed out that the effects of this Bill were going to be onerous on the industry. They pointed out that it did not do the job for the students or the industry. I want to make particular comment on a couple of the clauses in the Bill. Clause 6 deals with trust accounts. I asked all witnesses what they thought that clause meant and none of them knew what it meant. Each one of them tried to provide an interpretation of what it meant and each interpretation was fundamentally different. Of course, that is one of the clauses that has been amended. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing which I find very distasteful about this particular piece of legislation is that it discriminates against Australian students. My colleague Senator Teague has covered that point, so I shall not say any more about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I find clause 8 very distasteful. We on this side of the chamber have put forward a number of amendments to this clause. What I found distasteful about this particular clause was that it assumed that those people who had to report on their financial status were guilty and that they had to prove their innocence. We have set about to correct that situation and I am pleased to say that the Government has accepted the amendments that we have put forward. I will deal with that matter in a little more detail in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to make brief reference to the Industry Commission report. I find it absolutely incredible-in fact it is amazing-that this Bill is being debated in this place now, I think two days after that report came out. It seems logical to me, by any fair judgment, that that report should have and could have been the basis for putting this legislation together. The situation would have been far more satisfactory if we had waited a little bit longer and taken into account the wisdom from the Industry Commission's report and incorporated in the legislation the line that it suggested should have been taken. </PARA>

He has produced a discredited Treasurer who now sits on the back bench. I am quite certain that he is more interested in the power play going on within the Australian Labor Party than he is with getting this Bill right. One can only describe this Bill as a mickey mouse Bill because the whole area of education is really a State responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As pointed out by my colleague, there are 35 amendments to an 8-page Bill containing 18 clauses. There are six amendments from the Government, 13 from the Committee, eight from the Opposition and eight, as I understand it, from the Australian Democrats. So in fact, the product that was first brought before us cannot be recognised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to Senator Bell, no we cannot, but I cannot think of a better word at this stage. I deal now with the amendments that I will be moving in the committee stage. In clause 8, we are changing the onus of proof from the provider. We are changing clauses in the Bill to create a situation which fits with standard accounting provisions by making the specified time at the conclusion of each financial year instead of at each quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are also amending the Bill so that, if the Minister for Employment, Education and Training forms a reasonable belief that a registered provider may have failed to comply with the requirements of clause 8 (2)-and those are the areas that I talked about-failed to comply with the requirements of clause 6, or provided an annual return which contains misleading or deceptive information, he may then act to seek information rather than having the reverse. This puts the checks and balances into the Bill, but it lessens its onerous impact on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day when we look at this export industry-and it is an export industry-we can see that we require an industry based on self-discipline but with the checks and balances that are needed to protect it and look after the interests of students, not only overseas students but also Australian students, and allows the industry to develop and grow. I am quite confident that over the years it will grow and prosper and become stronger. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to touch on-although I will not be moving the amendment myself-is the agreement by the Government to have this Act repealed no later than 1 January 1994. That also is a very important step. It is one area relative to this Bill where I can compliment Minister Dawkins for at least coming to grips with one aspect of our concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> I wind up my remarks by endorsing the comments of my colleague Senator Calvert. I believe that the committee system in this case, with all committee members, has worked well. It has been my first experience of sitting down and going through a Bill in detail. I want to add my compliments to all the people who sat on the committee because they did produce a lot of satisfactory work. I also compliment the people who came before us and gave evidence because they were very constructive in what they did. My final comment is that, even though I acknowledge the last clause, which the Government has agreed to, this Bill certainly does no credit whatsoever to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am honoured to participate in this debate and am glad that it has been possible. I mention at the outset that, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I believe that the process we went through as a committee was a very productive one. Obviously, what was moved and amended in the Committee and the consensus we reached was not the total picture. There has to be a period in which the shadow Minister in the other House and the Minister discuss the issues, and I guess at the end of the day there is always some sort of political agreement reached which is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have got out of this process the best possible Bill we can. I do not think it is possible to cover all the areas of concern. For example, how can we legislate adequately for quality? We can move to push the system towards the creation and the retention of quality, but we cannot legislate for it. The best that can be done is to set out to protect Australia's reputation overseas in terms of the type of service that is being offered to the students and the type of institutions which provide that service, and to ensure that the problems that exposed themselves over the last few years are, if not abolished, at least contained as much as any government working in the Federal system can contain them. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that within the system there have been dishonest providers of services. In other words, in some cases they have told blatant lies about the sort of service they were going to offer overseas students. We know that in some cases the students themselves have not been bona fide students; they have simply used the system to get into Australia and then deliberately overstayed and become de facto residents of Australia through that process. We know that on some occasions there have been inadequate and incompetently run institutions-institutions which may not have had the financial expertise, let alone anything else, to ensure their continued existence. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, this will happen in any industry which is new and in a position of rapid growth, as this industry is. I indicate at the outset some statistics which clearly point out that this is an industry in which there has been rapid growth. For example, by 1988 there were 25,000 outstanding applications for English language intensive courses for overseas students courses alone. That is, 25,000 students from overseas had indicated that they wanted to get into a course for which there was no room at that time. We have something like 70,000 overseas students in this country. About 44,000 are straight fee paying. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, the gross revenues or receipts from this industry were something like $10m. Four years later that figure grew to $636m-and that was only for the first nine months of last year. There were only about 250 students in informal studies in public institutions in 1986. That number had grown to 21,000 by the end of last year. Similarly, in short non-formal courses, the numbers have grown from 2,000 in 1986 to 23,000 at the end of last year, an enormous growth in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be worth noting at this stage that the sort of people who talk about improving Australia's balance of payments, those who talk about rejuvenating our manufacturing industries and those who talk about improving and downstreaming our primary industry processes and industries, have overlooked this area. It has not been a sexy subject. It is only when there is trouble in the initial stages of growth that the press, for example, decides that there is something interesting in this area. Once again, I would like to give members of the press in this place a good kick in the backside. They seem to be so intent on covering the presidential politics of both chambers and this institution and covering the hard economic growth areas that they have totally overlooked an industry which is now worth to us over $600m per annum and is still growing. The fact that that has hardly rated a mention in the columns of people such as Paul Kelly, Michelle Grattan and the other leaders of the Press Gallery in this place indicates quite clearly that sometimes their own areas of focus are totally out of touch with what is really going on in the big wide world outside Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> I just make that point in passing, but I am going to make it over and over until the Press Gallery in this place starts to realise it, that it does have an obligation to the Australian community to cover more than just the in-fights, the slanging matches and the presidential campaigns that go on in this place and the hard, dry economic rationalist viewpoints that seem to prevail in the bureaucracy. Other things are going on and members of the press ought to be reporting them. If they did, they would actually find a willing readership and a willing audience. People would say, `Yes, something is going on in this country which is not always related to the activities of government'. The Government is not responsible for the boom that has occurred in this area, but at least it has tried to utilise that boom and has in this case tried to overcome some of the problems that occur as a result of a booming industry just getting off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, if we look at the question I just raised by implication-why the Government had to act now and what its motives really are in bringing down this Bill-it is fair to say that Minister Dawkins has tried not to bog this newly developing industry down in regulation and red tape. That is not easy because we are dealing with private and public institutions; six State governments, two Territory governments and a Federal government; and semi-autonomous institutions such as the universities. It is a very wide area for a government to legislate in. It would be very easy for a government to move in and with a very heavy hand say, `This is what will occur' to try to survive the challenges that some of the State governments and maybe some institutions may take against our constitutional right to do that. It would be very easy for the Government to say, `This is what will happen', and to regulate every part of this industry in order to ensure that it had a tight system. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think we can do that in an era in which we are all learning. We are all learning what it is like to be a country that is offering education services to foreigners. It is a boom industry with such potential. It is an area in which there are certain qualitative decisions to be made, difficult qualitative decisions about the quality of education and the way that industry is sold overseas, and no government will be able to put it all in one box and say, `There is the Bill, there are the regulations that will in fact make this system work perfectly'. It will not work perfectly, because there are always humans involved in this area. There are people who want to make a fast buck because they see it as a developing area. There are students who are not bona fide students, who simply want to come to live in Australia and they do not care how they do it. If they have to breach the immigration regulations by coming in as a student and then simply overstaying, then they will do it. There are people who are simply not very good teachers, who set up an institution, a college, or a service provision arrangement that is not up to scratch. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot legislate to ensure that all those people are first class teachers or first class providers of education services. But what we can do, and this is the important point of this Bill, is to say, `If you pay your money, that money will not be stolen from you as a student. If you enrol, the institution will be there when you arrive in Australia. If you ask for qualifications at the completion of a course, you will get those qualifications and they will be worth something. If you ask for a minimum level of educational standard to prevail in those institutions, then as a student you can demand it and there will be some guarantee you will get it'. Basically the Bill does that. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that the report of the Industry Commission has looked at this legislation, at what the Government is doing, and at the whole situation. It has made criticisms, and that is to be expected, first of all, because the bias or bent of the Industry Commission is primarily an economic one, and that is appropriate. We do need bodies which say, when looking at things primarily from an economic or fiscal viewpoint, `This is what ought to be done'. But they are not educationists, not people who ask, `What is the final product? What do you really want out of the system that has been established throughout Australia?'. </PARA>
<PARA> So I do take on board the Industry Commission report. I think it has a number of good suggestions and it is an addition to the debate. But it is not the answer to what must be done. In concluding my speech, I must say that I was very impressed indeed at the way, first of all, the Committee worked. I think there was a genuine attempt on the part of every member of that Committee to try to improve the Bill, to debate the issues within the Committee and then to come up with the solutions, to force the bureaucracy to be more realistic about some of the provisions there. There was the matter that Senator Tierney raised, for example, of what constitutes an appropriate trust account, and Senator Bell also spoke very strongly about that. It is a very important matter. It is simply not good enough to tell someone that their money will be protected in a trust account if it is nothing other than a fancy investment account from which the money can be taken by the service provider at any point in time. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the question of whether or not we should have quarterly audits was an interesting one. On the whole, I think the bureaucracy had the view that quarterly audits would be sufficient to stop shonky operators from pulling the money out of the system, winding up their institution and disappearing with the money, leaving the students high and dry. As someone pointed out quite succinctly, if one is a determined crook, quarterly audits will not stop that person, who simply waits until the quarterly audit is brought down and sets it up in such a way that the very next day the money the money can be pulled out and off they go. All of us have had some experience in corporate affairs matters where we have seen that type of thing done all the time. All the corporate affairs watchdogs in the world are never going to be able to get down to tintacks and stop those people if they are determined to be crooks. </PARA>
<PARA> What we can do is put in place a regime which at least minimises the possibility of that but which does not provide people with the false confidence that the system is absolutely airtight. I believe that in this case the amendments that will be moved by the Opposition-and with the acceptance of the Government-will do what we want to do, which basically is to have good annual audits but with the appropriate controls being put in the hands of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> So, that is the first point I want to make about the process, that the Committee itself worked very well. I think the Minister acknowledges that. I am sure that the shadow Minister acknowledged that because, let us face it, at the end of the discussions we had in the Committee and, at the time our suggested amendments were tabled, there were discussions that went on in the other place. Those discussions have basically led to a consensus viewpoint being taken in this place. I think we will get the best possible Bill that we can get out of this place, given that we are all politicians, that there is always the possibility of an Opposition wanting to score points or that a government might like to think it can do its duty by putting up a nice looking Bill and leaving it at that. Putting it another way, between the two extremes, I think we have the best of both worlds. </PARA>
<PARA> We do agree on one principle, though, and that is the principle that underlines this Bill, that this is an extremely valuable growth industry for Australia. It is part of the move towards a clever country. The protection of Australia's reputation overseas is absolutely vital. If this Bill does not work, the question of the sunset clause then becomes an important one. That is why the Government is accepting the sunset clause, with all the prescriptions that relate to that. We believe that, if this Bill does not work-and let us face it, the political process is not perfect-then we can review this Bill and the whole industry within a short period of time. I can assure the Senate that the Government of the day, that is, this Government--</PARA>

It is something that we can be proud of, because Australia is the clever country, and exporting our education services is something that we can bequeath to future generations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One probably cannot blame anyone! There is a conflict of direction from the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. On one hand we are told that the legislation is over-regulatory and burdensome. On the other hand we are told by the Australian Democrats that it is not sufficiently interventionist because it does not look after students. In response to both those points, over recent years, in trying to find a mid course, we have had an experience in this sector and any response has to take that experience into account. The legislation provides protection for students and flexibility which allows exemption for the good citizen institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In seeking to obtain a balance we have had criticisms from two different extremes of the argument. In terms of acknowledging the experience, the Industry Commission has expressed preliminary views about regulation of the system. If I can be intemperate enough, I would suggest that maybe it has not thought through the issues or presented a viable alternative. One has to look at the experience, constitutional structures, State responsibilities for education, including such factors as registration and accreditation, the trend towards accreditation and registration of courses and providers having regard to competency and educational outcomes, and the complexity of the scene that we are addressing and recent experience in it. </PARA>

<PARA>CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President: The commencement of the new national companies and securities scheme on the first of January this year marked the completion of the first phase of this Government's program for the reform of corporate regulation in Australia after the excesses of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>We now have in place in Australia a single national regulatory structure that provides an effective framework in which the Government can begin the major task of redressing the damage done to our business reputation and the confidence of investors in our markets during the ``Decade of Greed''. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of the Australian Securities Commission under the new national scheme, and the provision by the Government of substantially increased resources for corporate regulation and enforcement by comparison to that which was provided under the former co-operative scheme, is tangible evidence of this Government's determination to overcome these problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Equally as important as the need for the timely and effective enforcement of companies and securities laws, is the need for those laws themselves to clearly establish the standards of behaviour that the community is entitled to expect of its corporate directors and managers, and market participants. </PARA>
<PARA>At the time the legislative framework for the new national scheme was being prepared, the Attorney-General foreshadowed publicly that, following the establishment of the new scheme, the second phase of the Government's corporate reform program would commence. This second phase involves the reform of key areas of law that in the 1980s were shown to be deficient. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, Mr President, marks the first step in this second and most important phase of the reform of corporate regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>The major amendments contained in this Bill will bring about the necessary and long overdue reforms to require companies to consolidate their accounts and those of the entities they control, and to strengthen insider trading regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also includes machinery amendments relating to the clarification and re-inforcement of the legislative framework of the new national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The key law reforms contained in this Bill will complement the very considerable law enforcement effort of the ASC to raise the level of compliance with the law and bring about proper standards of corporate and market behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have mentioned, this Government is committed to an ongoing program of key law reform. This will involve a major review of the substantive companies and securities laws over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, it is an ambitious program. It must be: for too long important law reform was not undertaken under the former co-operative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of laws which establish proper standards of corporate and market behaviour, that are capable of being enforced effectively, and that will restore the confidence in Australian market for both Australian and foreign investors, is essential to our future economic prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of this process, the Government expects later this year to bring forward two further Bills to amend the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA>The next Bill will deal with a number of important matters. In particular it will include proposals to facilitate shorter settlement periods for share transfers. This will enable the Australian Stock Exchange to improve its efficiency and increase the international competitiveness of our sharemarket. Further amendments will include proposals arising from the review of the Australian Company Number requirement, and the clarification of certain aspects of the fundraising provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is expected that this Bill will be released for public exposure in June this year and will be introduced for passage during the Budget Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>The following Bill, the third in the program for 1991, will contain major reforms in relation to loans to directors and related party transactions, the framework for corporate insolvency, directors duties and the rights of shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>A full process of consultation with business and the community generally, will be undertaken in relation to these proposed reforms. To this end it is envisaged that the third Bill will be released for public exposure during the Budget Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>Having outlined the Government's future program, Mr President, I now turn to the specific reforms set out in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been widespread abuses of the existing company accounting and reporting requirements under which the true financial position of a group of companies has been able to be disguised by ``off-balance sheet'' reporting. This has enabled the financial statements of the company to be manipulated in such a way as to mislead investors and the market generally regarding the real level of liabilities or performance of a company or the group as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>These abuses have been possible because company reporting requirements apply to companies and their ``subsidiaries''. The definition of `subsidiary' has a rather technical meaning in the Law which does not reach non-corporate entities. Further, group accounts have not been required to be consolidated, with the result that they can be very difficult to analyse. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the consequences of these practices has been a significant loss of investor confidence, both amongst Australian and overseas investors, in the reliability of corporate financial information in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>To address these problems, the Bill provides for amendments to require that a company's directors must produce a single profit and loss account and balance sheet for all companies and other incorporated or unincorporated entities controlled by that company. The Bill will include a broad definition of control which focuses on the reality of control rather than technicalities. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to reinforce the requirement to comply with accounting standards, and to bring about greater consistency in accounts, a related amendment is to be made to the Corporations Law. Currently, the Law provides that the directors need not ensure that financial statements are made out in accordance with an accounting standard if to do so would fail to give a true and fair view. This has provided the scope for some companies to use some dubious accounting treatments in reliance on the more general, and vaguer, ``true and fair'' test, rather than to comply with a relevant appropriate accounting standard. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the amendments, financial statements will have to both comply with the accounting standards and give a true and fair view. In this way the obligations under the Law in relation to accounting standards will be brought into line with the obligations under the Law applicable to the requirements of Schedule 5 of the Corporations Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Insider trading has become a matter of increasing concern within the securities industry and amongst the wider community, contributing to the deterioration of public confidence in the securities markets more generally. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on constitutional and Legal Affair (The Griffiths' Committee) ``fair shares for all: insider trading in Australia'' in November 1989, recommended significant legislative reform and administrative action in relation to the enforcement of the existing insider trading provisions. The Government's response to the report, tabled in Parliament on 11 October 1990, accepted the majority of the Committee's recommendations for legislative amendment, and in December 1990 draft legislation and an accompanying explanatory paper were released for public exposure. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions in this Bill represent the outcome of the Government's consideration of that report in the light of public submissions on the exposure draft. </PARA>
<PARA>The key elements of the new provisions are as follows. </PARA>
<PARA>The definition of an ``insider'' will encompass corporations and partnerships as well as individuals. There will be no need for the prosecution to establish a connection between the person in possession of inside information and the company to which the information relates. Instead any person, including a tippee, who is in possession of inside information will be prohibited from using it to trade in or subscribe for securities of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>A statutory definition of inside information is to be included, based on a ``reasonable person'' test. A person will be prohibited from trading in securities whilst knowingly in possession of information that is not generally available and if it were generally available a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of securities. </PARA>
<PARA>Information will be defined as being generally available where it is disclosed in a manner which would, or would be likely to, bring it to the attention of persons who commonly invest in securities of a kind whose price or value might be affected by the information and where a reasonable period of time for the dissemination of information has elapsed. </PARA>
<PARA>The offence will be extended to trading in prescribed interests, such as units of unit trusts, and other relevant securities. The definition of securities will be clarified to ensure that it includes prescribed interests, options and convertible securities. </PARA>
<PARA>Monetary penalties will be increased to:-</PARA>
<PARA>- in the case of a natural person, $200,000, or 5 years imprisonment or both or</PARA>
<PARA>- in the case of a body corporate, $1,000,000. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, a body corporate that issued securities will be able to recover any profit accruing to the insider through dealing in those securities. Further, the ASC may bring an action in the name of, and for the benefit of, the body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed provisions aim to strengthen the law relating to insider trading while at the same time not lessening the basic protections given to the accused under our criminal law. The provisions seek to ensure that legitimate business activity can continue. </PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding the abysmal failure of insider trading prosecutions, the onus of proof will remain on the prosecution in respect of all elements of the offence including knowledge that the information is inside information. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the operation of these provisions will be monitored to see whether they are effective in preventing insider trading and in restoring investor confidence in the securities markets. </PARA>
<PARA>The futures insider trading provisions are also being reviewed with a view to adopting similar provisions to those proposed for securities in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Other significant amendments to the Corporations Law are proposed to be made in the Bill. To more effectively administer the unit trust industry and other prescribed interest schemes, the ASC will be given additional powers to regulate compliance with trust deeds by managers and trustees. The Bill proposes an amendment which will treat a breach of a covenant of a trust deed as a contravention of the Law. However, such a contravention will not amount to an offence. This will enable the ASC to investigate non-compliance with the provisions of deeds and to exercise its powers of civil enforcement where it discovers that such conduct has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>A further proposed amendment will facilitate the maintenance of an accurate ASC information base relating to company officers. It will require the retiring directors, where more than half retire or resign at one time, to notify the ASC of that fact. This will overcome the substantial difficulties created for both the ASC and the former officers which presently arise when a company is in effect ``sold'', and the incoming directors do not lodge the appropriate forms as they are required to do under the Law. </PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with the decision of the Ministerial Council at its meeting in February 1991, the Bill proposes a statutory moratorium in relation to the requirement for companies to include their Australia Company Number on their business documents and negotiable instruments. This amendment will further minimise any cost or possible confusion for the business community in relation to the A.C.N. requirement. Companies and bodies will not have to comply with this requirement until after 31 December 1991. There is a corresponding proposed amendment in relation to the Australian Registered Body Number. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains proposed amendments to the Corporations Act and the ASC Act to deal with various machinery, jurisdictional and transitional matters. </PARA>
<PARA>As the functions of the NCSC have been assumed by the ASC, and the further existence of that body is redundant, the NCSC Act is to be repealed and the NCSC abolished. The Bill provides for the winding up of the NCSC and the disposition of its assets, rights and liabilities, and will deal with related consequential and transitional matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision is to be made for the preparation of a final report and financial statements, and the vesting of former assets of the NCSC in the ASC or the Commonwealth, as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>These machinery provisions deal with the legal ownership of NCSC assets and liabilities. They do not affect the joint commitments by the Commonwealth and the States under the Heads of Agreement to share financial responsibility for the liabilities of the NCSC, nor do they affect the obligation of the Commonwealth to account to the States for half the value of NCSC assets calculated in accordance with the Heads of Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 9 of the Corporations Act is to be amended to confer cross-vested jurisdiction under the Corporations Law on the Family Court of Australia and the Family Court of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will restore to the Family Courts the jurisdiction those courts had in relation to matters arising under companies and securities legislation immediately prior to the commencement of the Corporations Law on 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to the introduction of the Corporations Law, the Family Courts had jurisdiction to deal with matters under the co-operative companies and securities legislation by virtue of the general scheme for the cross vesting of jurisdiction for Australian courts. However, the Corporations Act excluded the general cross vesting scheme and replaced it with a special regime for the vesting and cross vesting of jurisdiction between the Federal Court and the State and Territory Courts on Corporations Law matters under which all those Courts have full co-ordinate jurisdiction under the Law. </PARA>
<PARA>In the present Bill, the approach has been taken to give the Family Courts the same status under the Corporations Law as they had under the general cross-vesting legislation in relation to jurisdiction under the former companies and securities codes. The Family Courts will be subject to requirements to transfer Corporations Law matters to other courts in accordance with provisions which follow closely the general jurisdiction of courts cross vesting legislation. This will enable the Family Courts to deal with Corporations Law matters when they arise in an ancillary way in relation to Family Law proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>A Family Court will be able to transfer a case to any appropriate State Supreme Court or the Federal Court having jurisdiction under the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA>Various amendments are proposed to the provisions of the Corporations Act to make more explicit and clarify, in relation to the national scheme laws applying in the A.C.T., the ``federalisation'' formula under the State Application Acts. That legislative device is the mechanism by which the Commonwealth Laws relating to the investigation and prosecution of offences, and the review of administrative decisions, apply to matters arising under the State Corporations Laws and ASC Laws as if those laws were Commonwealth and not State Laws. </PARA>
<PARA>One further feature of the Bill that it is appropriate to mention concerns the amendments contained in the Bill that are proposed to commence from the date when the new national scheme began operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of providing retrospective application for these amendments is to provide commercial certainty by avoiding the possibility of an unexpected and or unnecessary loss of rights, or the imposition of additional liabilities, on the business community and other persons. This is particularly the case in respect of those provisions which are intended to put beyond doubt that no substantive change in the law occurred on 1 January 1991, such as the provisions in the Bill recognising the national effect of the registration of company charges under the Corporations Law of a jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amending provisions to commence on 1 January 1991, such as those amendments relating to the legislative machinery of the new national scheme, reflect corresponding provisions in the State Application Laws and seek to reinforce the valid national operation of the new scheme, or make explicit what was intended to be implicit in the operation of the new national scheme laws when they came into force on 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The remaining provisions of the Bill, Mr President, propose various technical and clarifying amendments and make minor drafting corrections to the Corporations Act, the Corporations Law and the ASC Act and ASC Law. </PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with the arrangements under the Heads of Agreement relating to the new national scheme, the members of the Ministerial Council for Corporations have been fully consulted on the Bill. Some members of the Ministerial Council made specific comments on the draft Bill. The Bill was also refined in the light of comments from the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee (and its various sub-committees) and the Australian Accounting Standards Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Following consideration of the comments from the Council and others a revised Bill was circulated to the members of the Council which has now voted to approve the Bill in the form in which it is being introduced today. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill marks, as I have said, the first step under the new scheme on the path to restoring our international business reputation. It will assist in establishing a corporate and market environment in which business and investors may carry out their essential activities, and prosper, with confidence in the stability and fairness of that environment. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>COURTS (MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION) BILL</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of this Bill honours a commitment made by the Prime Minister on 20 March 1990 that the Government would introduce legislation to facilitate alternative dispute resolution in the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill enables the courts to provide parties with a greater choice of methods of dispute resolution. As well as the traditional methods of judicial determination, and those methods of alternative dispute resolution already provided by the courts, the Federal Court and the Family Court will be able to offer litigants, and potential litigants, the options of mediation and arbitration. These options can provide efficient and cost effective alternatives to the judicial process for the resolution of many disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Fully contested litigation is invariably expensive and time consuming, both for the parties and the public in the provision of courts and judicial officers. The expense and stress involved in protracted litigation may mean that judicial determination of a dispute is not a practical or appropriate solution in many cases, and the availability of non-litigious methods of dispute resolution will provide savings in terms of cost and time while ensuring that there is a means whereby a dispute can be brought to an end. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill allows for the development of mediation in both courts. In mediation, a neutral third person assists the parties to arrive at their own solution to their dispute. Mediation is particularly suitable for parties who need to preserve ongoing relationships. The essence of mediation is that the parties are empowered to produce the result that is best suited to their own individual and collective needs. Commercial litigants can benefit from speedy, cost efficient resolution of disputes without the strain to a business relationship that can result from protracted litigation. Other types of disputes can also benefit from a less hostile process of resolution. In family matters, even when a couple have decided to end their relationship, communication between them may need to be preserved over a long period where questions of the custody of, and access to, children are involved. Avoidance of a bitter and formal legal battle is to be preferred, allowing both parties to concentrate on the issues in dispute, including non-legal issues, and assisting them to find the solution that best provides for the welfare of their children. </PARA>
<PARA>Mediation may be more likely to lead to a final resolution of personal issues than litigation, as parties are able to fashion their solutions without being limited to legal remedies. It is well known that most cases are resolved without recourse to a fully contested hearing. However, many litigants incur expense and delay by waiting until a matter is ``at the door of the court'' before attempting to settle. It is expected that the availability of court-annexed mediation will encourage those parties who can settle to do so earlier in their proceedings. Even if the mediation is unsuccessful and the dispute is presented for judicial determination, the issues in dispute should be better defined, resulting in faster resolution by the court. </PARA>
<PARA>Arbitration is the determination of a dispute by a third person who is not a judge. It has been used to resolve commercial disputes for many years, and is particularly suitable for the determination of disputes that do not involve complex matters of law. While not offering the same non-financial benefits or cost efficiency as mediation, parties who choose to use an independent arbitrator may have their disputes resolved more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>It is recognised by both the Government and the courts that not all disputes are suitable for resolution by mediation or arbitration. For example, in matters in which child abuse or domestic violence is alleged mediation is not appropriate. To be successful, mediation must have the cooperation and participation of both parties. If the power balance between the parties is unequal, or one party is not prepared to negotiate, then mediation may not be the best method for the resolution of the dispute. Arbitration may not be appropriate if the matter in dispute is one of public importance or involves complex questions of law. The legislation recognises these issues and limits the matters that may be heard by an arbitrator in the Family Court and gives both courts the power to make rules to determine those matters appropriate for referral to mediation or arbitration. Judicial determination of a dispute will always be available to those parties who do not wish to use arbitration or mediation or when mediation has been attempted but has been unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill does not diminish the jurisdiction of either the Federal Court or the Family Court. It can be seen that the courts retain control over the enforcement of the outcomes of mediation and arbitration. What this Bill does is to provide the courts with the legislative framework in which they might develop those forms of alternative dispute resolution in a manner best suited to their jurisdictions by making rules of court to define and prescribe procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Family Law Act 1975 to allow the Family Court of Australia to make rules to provide for mediation in the court. It is expected that the rules will provide guidance as to the types of dispute which are appropriate for mediation and the manner in which a mediation might proceed. If the court decides to make rules for mediation, parties may, in accordance with those rules, apply to the court for referral to a mediator. They may apply before litigation has commenced, or at any time during proceedings. The court has the power to refer suitable matters to mediation, at any stage in proceedings, with the consent of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also amends the Family Law Act to provide for two separate methods of arbitration. Arbitration can be made available in the Family Court or be conducted by private arbitrators. Private arbitration may be used in property or spousal maintenance disputes, by parties who choose to have their dispute determined by an arbitrator who has been prescribed in the regulations as a person who may conduct a private arbitration. The Bill enables the parties to apply to the court for orders to assist the conduct of an arbitration and to enforce an arbitral award. </PARA>
<PARA>The Family Court will have power to make rules so that it may refer spousal maintenance or matrimonial property matters arising under part VIII of the Family Law Act to arbitrators with or without the consent of the parties. The limitations on the matters that may be arbitrated ensure that the Family Court retains sole responsibility for the determination of disputes involving children, and that arbitration can be used only in those areas that are most likely to be appropriate for a non-judicial determination of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Bill amends the Family Law Act to allow the court to refer a matter to an assessor for examination and report. It is expected that the use of assessors, where appropriate, will assist the court to resolve those disputes before it quickly and efficiently, and thereby further the aim of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to allow the Federal Court to refer suitable matters to mediation and to make rules of court defining the procedure to be followed. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Federal Court parties have for some time been able to register arbitrator's awards. This Bill allows the Federal Court to refer matters to arbitration with the consent of the parties and provides that an award made in court-referred arbitration may also be registered and enforced. The legislation does not limit the types of matters that the Federal Court may refer to arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA>If a matter, or a part of a matter, is referred to an arbitrator by either the Federal Court or the Family Court, the parties have a right to a full rehearing of that matter. This provides safeguards as to the quality of decision making, and ensures that justice is not foregone in the pursuit of economy or efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>Both the Family Court and the Federal Court presently offer methods of alternative, or assisted, dispute resolution. The Family Court, through its counselling service and registrar conferences, has, since 1976, been at the forefront in offering non-litigious methods for solving disputes. The Federal Court commenced a system of assisted dispute resolution since 1987. The program provides for parties to attend mediation conferences with registrars. </PARA>
<PARA>The initiatives outlined in this Bill should be seen as part of a wider Government commitment to alternative dispute resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of its commitment to family services the Government funds community organisations to provide family mediation services throughout Australia. It has also provided funds for the coordination and evaluation of current legal aid commission initiatives in the alternative dispute resolution area and provided considerable funding for marriage counselling, marriage education and family therapy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also recognises the work done by such organisations as the Institute of Arbitrators, the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration, Lawyers Engaged in Alternative Dispute Resolution and the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre in providing alternative dispute resolution services for commercial clients in both international and domestic disputes. The Government will continue to support the use of alternative dispute resolution methods in its own contractual arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>PROCEEDS OF CRIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Proceeds of Crime Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 will set up the Confiscated Assets Trust Fund. The Trust Fund will turn the assets confiscated from major crime, particularly drug trafficking, back against the illicit drug trade. Such a fund was foreshadowed by the previous Attorney-General, the Honourable Lionel Bowen, when introducing the Proceeds of Crime Bill in 1987. Details of the Trust Fund were announced by the Prime Minister during the election campaign in March 1990. The Trust Fund is a significant further step in the Government's war on organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has realised that in the attack on organised crime it is not sufficient to merely put criminals behind bars. The most effective method of uprooting a criminal organisation is to sever its lifeline of money. There is growing evidence that the Government's Proceeds of Crime initiative is making significant inroads in this direction. Up to 30 June 1990 nearly $7 million had been recovered and paid to the Revenue as a result of the action under the Proceeds of Crime Act and the related provisions of the Customs Act. A further $47 million was frozen under restraining orders pending the making of future confiscation orders. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1 July 1990 to the end of April 1991 a further $2 million has been recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act and the narcotics provisions of the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Similar Trust Funds operate in a number of Australian States where the money is used for law enforcement purposes as well as for the rehabilitation of drug users and the compensation of victims of crime. This ensures that the community benefits from the assets confiscated from criminals. As well, a Trust Fund has operated for a number of years in the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA>The Trust Fund will comprise funds confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act or the drug trafficking provisions of the Customs Act. The Trust Fund will also comprise proceeds resulting from the confiscation of the property of major drug offenders, and those guilty of revenue fraud, generally tax fraud, customs scams and medifraud. Forfeited property, vehicles and other assets will generally be sold and the proceeds placed in the Trust Fund. In some cases, however, seized equipment may be of direct use to law enforcement agencies. In such cases I will retain my existing power to direct that the equipment be given to the law enforcement agency for operational use. Eventually that property will be sold and the proceeds of sale paid to the Trust Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>It is anticipated that the amount paid to the Trust Fund will be around $9 million over the next three years. The major portion of this money will be earmarked for payment to law enforcement projects and to drug rehabilitation and drug education schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>The money in the Trust Fund will be designated either as ``distributable funds'' or as ``suspended funds''. Suspended funds are identified in proposed paragraph 34C (1) (a) of the Proceeds of Crime Act, which is contained in clause 19 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The first purpose for which suspended money is required is for payments to the States or the Northern Territory under the equitable sharing program. This program provides for the sharing by the Commonwealth with the States and the N.T. of confiscated assets where the amount recovered has resulted from a joint investigation involving participation by law enforcement agencies of both jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA>The first payments under this scheme were made by the Commonwealth in February of this year when an amount of $62,000 was paid to Western Australia and an amount of $121,505 was paid to New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Crime, particularly organised crime, does not recognise any State boundaries. To foster a high level of co-operation it is imperative to recognise the contributions made by State law enforcement agencies to the prosecution of major criminals and the confiscation of their property. </PARA>
<PARA>The second purpose for which ``suspended funds'' are required is for repatriation to a foreign country where this is required by a particular Mutual Assistance arrangement to which Australia is a party. For example, if a forfeiture order made in a foreign order is registered in Australia under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and, as a result, property is confiscated then the amount recovered will be paid to the Trust Fund. Ordinarily, Australia's Mutual Assistance arrangements do not provide for repatriation. Property recovered is usually retained by the jurisdiction which enforced the confiscation order. However, if the arrangement does provide for repatriation then the amount will be paid out of ``suspended funds'' from the Trust Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>Confiscation orders may be made under legislation in each State (apart from Tasmania) and the Northern Territory. The A.C.T. is also in the process of preparing its own legislation dealing with the confiscation of criminal assets. Where this State or Territory legislation is prescribed as a ``corresponding law'' under the Proceeds of Crime Act, orders made under the State Act may be registered under the Commonwealth Act. Registration enables the State or Territory order to be enforced against property located in a Commonwealth Territory. Registration also facilitates the enforcement of the State order against property located overseas under Australia's Mutual Assistance arrangements. Accordingly, if money is repatriated to Australia under such an arrangement and it derives from the enforcement of a State order, the money will be paid to the Trust Fund. However, provision has been made for an appropriate amount to be paid from suspended funds to the State or Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The bulk of the Trust Fund will be ``distributable funds''. These funds will be targeted at law enforcement programs and at drug rehabilitation and drug education programs. Law enforcement projects which promote the investigation, detection or prosecution of serious criminal offences will be funded from the Trust Fund. The Australian Federal Police, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Customs Service will be some of the law enforcement agencies which will benefit from the Trust Fund in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>So far as the funding of drug rehabilitation and drug education schemes is concerned the particular programs to be funded will be selected by the Minister of State responsible for health matters, who will be able to consult with such advisory bodies on drug related matters as he considers appropriate. My colleague, the Hon Peter Staples, who has responsibility for the National Campaign against Drug Abuse, intends that the money available for drug rehabilitation and drug education programs will be targeted at demand reduction and rehabilitation programs for illicit drugs. Therefore all disbursements from the fund will go towards the Commonwealth's fight against illicit drugs through an emphasis on both supply and demand reduction. </PARA>
<PARA>Naturally there will be costs associated with the administration of the fund. Provision is made for the deduction of a prescribed management fee from suspended funds in the Trust Fund. Finally, provision is made for the payment out of suspended funds of money payable by the Commonwealth by way of restitution or compensation of third parties pursuant to orders made by the court under sections 21, 22 or 31 of the Proceeds of Crime Act where property the subject of the claim has been paid into the Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible to be certain about the amount of money which will be available for these purposes in any given year. However, the Government is heartened by the growing success of the Proceeds of Crime initiative. This initiative is aimed at severing the tap root of organised crime by cutting off the supply of money. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>COUNCIL FOR ABORIGINAL RECONCILIATION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Today I bring before the Senate legislation establishing the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the intention of the Government, backed I hope by a unanimous commitment of the Parliament, that the formal process of reconciliation initiated by this Bill will signal the beginning of a decade of reform and social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and for building bridges of understanding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The Discussion Paper on which this Bill is based has been widely circulated in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA>The object of the Discussion Paper was twofold:</PARA>
<PARA>* to keep faith with Aboriginal aspirations; and</PARA>
<PARA>* to strive for cross-party support for the reconciliation initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for a process of reconciliation has been recognised by all major political parties. </PARA>
<PARA>The support which has been forthcoming for the reconciliation process from Australia's indigenous peoples has been of vital importance. There have been too many expressions of support to record at this time, but I emphasise that support has been forthcoming from a wide range of organisations including the Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Central Land Council, the Aboriginal Coordinating Council in Queensland, the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations, the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, and the Aboriginal and Islander Commission members of the Australian Council of Churches. </PARA>
<PARA>Support for the initiative in the non-Aboriginal community has also been extremely heartening. Organisations which have supported the proposals outlined in the Discussion Paper and now included in this Bill include Australian Churches, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Medical Association, the National Farmers Federation, the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia and many major Australian companies and community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the objectives of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been to remove unnecessary political point-scoring from Aboriginal Affairs to enable the nation to move forward over the coming decade with a broadly agreed agenda for reform which will meet the aspirations of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>The process of reconciliation has as its objective the transformation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Only three weeks ago the Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was tabled in the Parliament. That historic Report, containing 339 recommendations, provides a vital part of a practical agenda for the nation over the coming decade. The Report touches on every level of Government and its recommendations reach out to the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Report of the Royal Commission at this time because of the integral relationship of that historic document to the Bill now before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>It was of considerable significance that Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC, in the Royal Commission's 5 volume National Report described the reconciliation process, now reflected in this Bill, as ``the fundamental backdrop to reform and change,'' and commented that ``reconciliation of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities must be an essential commitment of all sides if change is to be genuine and long term.''</PARA>
<PARA>The interrelationship between the process of reconciliation and the Report and recommendations of the Royal Commission is a theme to which I shall return. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will create the vehicle through which the reconciliation process will be conducted-the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The Bill is a machinery measure to initiate the process: it is not the end but the beginning of the process. </PARA>
<PARA>The object of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, as set out in Section 5 of the Bill, is to promote a process of reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community, based on an appreciation by the Australian community as a whole of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and achievements and of the unique position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders as the indigenous peoples of Australia, and by means that include the fostering of an ongoing national commitment to co-operate to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>Consistent with this object, the main functions of the Council will include:</PARA>
<PARA>* to undertake initiatives for the purpose of promoting reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community;</PARA>
<PARA>* to promote by leadership, education and discussion a deeper understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and of the need to redress that disadvantage;</PARA>
<PARA>* to provide a forum for discussion by all Australians of issues relating to reconciliation with Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and of policies to be adopted by Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments to promote reconciliation;</PARA>
<PARA>* to consult Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community on whether reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents of reconciliation; and</PARA>
<PARA>* after that consultation, to report to the Minister on the views of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and of the wider community, as to whether such a document or documents would benefit the Australian community as a whole, and, if the Council considers there would be such a benefit, to make recommendations to the Minister on the nature and content of, and manner of giving effect to, such a document or documents. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the functions relating to a document or instrument of reconciliation, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and Commissioner Johnston agree that the approach should concentrate on the process of reconciliation and not an instrument which might become an outcome of the process. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Johnston has also observed that, in the past, there has been a tendency for the process to be ``bogged down and diverted by concentration on issues about which there was, or might be, disagreement''. As Commissioner Johnston so correctly stated ``words can enlighten but they can also impose their own tyranny.'' The Minister agrees absolutely with this view. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the composition of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, established by this Bill, will comprise not more than 25 members. </PARA>
<PARA>The Council will consist of:</PARA>
<PARA>* a Chairperson, who must be Aboriginal; and</PARA>
<PARA>* a Deputy Chairperson; and</PARA>
<PARA>* a person nominated by the Minister; and</PARA>
<PARA>* a person nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives; and</PARA>
<PARA>* a person nominated by the Leader of any Non-Government Party in the Parliament of at least 5 members that is not part of the Opposition; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the Deputy Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA>* other members appointed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>At least two members will be Torres Strait Islanders and 12 will be Aboriginal. Other members will be drawn from church, business, trade union, ethnic and other community leaders. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw to the attention of Honourable Senators that this departs in two respects from the membership outlined in the Discussion Paper. Firstly, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will not be a member of the Council-this change arises from the Minister's appointment as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and consequently the Minister to whom the Council will report. Secondly, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of any Non-government Party in the Parliament of at least five members will each nominate a representative to membership of the Council-those representatives need not be Members of the Parliament. It is the Government's intention that its representative will be a Member of Parliament and its strong desire that the other two representatives also be Members of Parliament, so as to ensure that there is a direct link between the work of the Council and the Parliament. The Opposition expressed a preference for flexibility in making a nomination and the Government has taken this view into account in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation provides that, before members are appointed to the Council, the Minister is to consult with the Leader of the Opposition; the Leader of any Non-Government Party in the Parliament of at least 5 members which is not part of the Opposition; and with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Although the legislation provided for appointments of up to 4 years, initial appointments to the Council will be for a period up to three years. </PARA>
<PARA>As these and other provisions demonstrate, this legislation has been carefully framed to achieve continuing cross-party commitment to the process of reconciliation through to the centenary of Federation in 2001. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have indicated, a central role of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will be to bring about, through education, a greater level of awareness of Aboriginal history, cultures, dispossession, continuing disadvantage and the need to redress that disadvantage. In short we must come to terms honestly with our own history as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA>In so many ways this is a sad history which includes the dispossession, massacre and dispersal of Aboriginal people, confinement in reserves, removal of children from their families and the destruction of aspects of Aboriginal culture. As the Royal Commission recognised, this history-and much of it very recent history-needs to be recognised as the primary cause of the current disadvantaged position of Australia's indigenous peoples. </PARA>
<PARA>The objective is not to create guilt but to create an understanding of an important part of the history of Australia and the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in that history. </PARA>
<PARA>The outcome will be practical and positive. All fair-minded non-Aboriginal Australians will have the opportunity to develop an appreciation of Aboriginal people and of their disadvantaged position in society as well as an appreciation of the richness of Aboriginal cultures and achievements and the special position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the indigenous peoples of this continent. </PARA>
<PARA>This process of public awareness and community education will involve among other things a focus on our education systems. </PARA>
<PARA>Generations of non-Aboriginal Australians have grown up with a very poor education about Aboriginal Australia. As recently as 1967 an official NSW school history textbook for Year 10 said Aborigines who lived in towns would ``recklessly share their possessions with parasitic relatives and friends''. </PARA>
<PARA>The textbook went on to say ``probably the greatest problem was presented by Aborigines and part-Aborigines who seemed to inhabit a `lost world.' They had lost the high moral and ethical traits of their ancestors, and had also failed to accept the white man's moral and legal codes. They were lazy individuals, apparently devoid of morals, and always prepared to lie, cheat or steal''. </PARA>
<PARA>Think how 16 year old Aborigines felt being taught this version of Australia's history at High School in 1967. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier this year the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs announced a National Reconciliation and Schooling Strategy which will see schools play a key role in creating an awareness of Aboriginal issues in the community, to be implemented in close consultation with State, Territory and non-Government schools. </PARA>
<PARA>The public awareness and education process must also, however, reach out to Australians who have already left school. </PARA>
<PARA>It has always been the Government's objective that the process should have a strong community focus. Millions of non-Aboriginal Australians have no contact with Aboriginal people. In local communities across Australia we need to establish the opportunity for dialogue. In this process Aboriginal people must be given the opportunity to work together with the non-Aboriginal community-local government, the churches, the business community, the trade union movement, service clubs and community organisations. It is my hope that the reconciliation process will touch the lives of all Australians in their local communities. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to a most critical aspect of the whole reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA>The Preamble to the legislation seeks a national commitment to address Aboriginal social justice issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph d of the Preamble states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``as a part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from governments at all levels to cooperate and to co-ordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading to the centenary of Federation, 2001''.</PARA>
<PARA>As a nation we must not miss the opportunity presented by the centenary of Federation to address critical areas of Aboriginal disadvantage. There can be no reconciliation without justice. </PARA>
<PARA>Unless all levels of government co-operate to redress Aboriginal disadvantage, Aboriginal people will remain, on all relevant social indicators, the most disadvantaged Australians. It was these underlying issues of critical Aboriginal disadvantage which the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found were the principal reason for the disproportionately high rates of Aboriginal imprisonment-up to 30 times those of non-Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the graphic picture of Aboriginal Australia provided by the lives and deaths of those 99 predominantly young Aboriginal Australians who died in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>* The average age at death was only 32 years. </PARA>
<PARA>* Of the 99 Aboriginal people who died, 43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>* 83 of the 99 were unemployed at the date of their last detention. </PARA>
<PARA>* 43 of the 99 had been charged with an offence at or before the age of 15. </PARA>
<PARA>* Only 2 of the 99 had completed secondary schooling. </PARA>
<PARA>* 43 of the 99 were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the over-use of alcohol and, in the remaining cases, the Royal Commission concluded that alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time. </PARA>
<PARA>* The Royal Commission concluded that the standard of health of the 99-whose average age was 32-varied from poor to very bad. </PARA>
<PARA>* The average age of those dying from natural causes was a little over 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of a national commitment to redress Aboriginal disadvantage will not be achieved simply by the enactment of this legislation. The unanimous commitment of the Parliament to this objective will, however, be a solid foundation for the achievement of the necessary intergovernmental co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>But this commitment must be backed by specific intergovernmental programs and policies in areas such as the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy, the Aboriginal Education Policy and the National Aboriginal Health Strategy, and this backing must be underpinned by the necessary funding from all levels of Government. </PARA>
<PARA>All Governments will be judged now and by history on whether they honour their expressed commitments to these policies. For example, there can be no more pressing need at this moment than for State and Territory Governments to join with the Commonwealth to meet our obligation to implement the National Aboriginal Health Strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>As both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have observed, as a part of the reconciliation process there should also be a national commitment to the attainment of specific goals in redressing Aboriginal disadvantage. The setting of these goals needs to be a co-operative exercise by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments. Goals thus agreed will have credibility and offer realistic measures of achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>State and local governments will need to be actively involved in the reconciliation process. The Commonwealth welcomes the support already given by State Governments and by the Government of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Reconciliation is not a vague concept. It is a practical process. </PARA>
<PARA>As an indication of the practical nature of the Council's work, the Bill makes provision for the Council to develop strategic plans that include statements of the Council's goals and objectives in the promotion of the process of reconciliation, together with indicators and targets for measuring the Council's performance in relation to those goals and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The requirement is for the Council to produce its first strategic plan, covering a three-year period, within 12 months of the commencement of the legislation. A further requirement is that each strategic plan must be laid before each House of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>To highlight the cross-party approach we have taken to the reconciliation process, I remind Honourable Senators of the provision in the Bill that stipulates that, before the Minister approves a strategic plan developed by the Council, the Leader of the Opposition must be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been privileged to attend many significant gatherings of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These events have often been moving and uplifting experiences, and they have helped shape this process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA>Through these experiences, one comes to understand the depth of the hurt felt by Aboriginal people over the prejudice and lack of respect shown to them in their daily lives by so many non-Aboriginal Australians. Aboriginal people understandably feel frustration and anger over their treatment. But there is also an enormous reservoir of hope, purpose and goodwill within Aboriginal communities across Australia. I mention just two events which embody what this process of reconciliation is all about. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year the Minister attended a graduation ceremony for two young Aboriginal doctors at the University of Newcastle. One of them, Sandra Eades, spoke about what it was like to be an Aboriginal woman and a doctor-of how when people looked at her in the hospital with her white coat they would look again, not believing what they had seen. Her very presence shattered the false and all-too-common stereotypes of Aboriginal people. Sandra Eades said that her achievement in becoming a doctor was not so much a personal one, but one which showed that Aboriginal people could if given the chance do anything. </PARA>
<PARA>The second event was the transfer to Aboriginal ownership of a pastoral property at Merapah on Cape York in June last year. The former Queensland Government's overtly racist policy of blocking the transfer of pastoral leases to Aboriginal interests, even when they had been purchased on the open market as in this case, meant that it was not until 1990 that the first such property was openly transferred to Aboriginal ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>At the transfer ceremony, an elderly Aboriginal man, Wompoo Kepple, spoke from personal experience. </PARA>
<PARA>Wompoo Kepple has had no formal education. He has no real knowledge of federal parliaments, of the workings of government, even of capital city life. As a young boy on Cape York, he lived through the brutal treatment of his people, their exploitation by pastoralists and their removal from their lands. In more recent times, he has seen his people suffer from the problems which afflict many Aboriginal communities because of their disadvantaged position in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>On that day in Cape York, Wompoo Kepple spoke with sadness, but without bitterness. He spoke remembering the history, but looking to the future. Wompoo Kepple said more eloquently than can I what is needed in this country: that Australia is a great country and that there is room for us all in it. But what all Australians must do, he said, is to think about how we are going to co-operate and to live together in harmony. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what the process of reconciliation seeks to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Parliament has shown before that it is capable of finding common ground in Aboriginal Affairs. In 1967, the then Federal Coalition Government and the Labor Opposition joined to support constitutional change to effectively give Aboriginal people full citizenship. The people of this nation responded to that clear and powerful message-and a record 92 per cent of voters supported the referendum proposing the change. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Parliament now faces another opportunity to provide a lead for this country. </PARA>
<PARA>In drafting this legislation, the Government has taken into account the views of a wide spectrum of organisations and individuals; it has consulted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the Australian Democrats and the Federal Coalition; considered their views and addressed their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation does not seek to realise a narrow political agenda; it establishes a practical and effective method of coming to grips with something which goes to the heart of this country's identity and its place in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a process framed to endure for the decade, calculated to transform relations between Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal Australians, and to build a national commitment to social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a process which is intrinsically Australian. One based on: recognition of the essential dignity of humankind; elimination of racism; recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as Australia's indigenous peoples; and a commitment to a fair go for Australia's most disadvantaged people. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a process which is intended to be substantially completed by the time of our most important national anniversary, the centenary of the establishment of the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a process deliberately intended to shape the kind of country we will be in 2001, less than 10 years from now. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a process which will capture national and international attention. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a process which the whole nation must embrace and which must not be allowed to fail. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate, and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988. These Acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits for Commonwealth sector employees. </PARA>
<PARA>The present Bill does not contain any major new initiatives for the reform of Commonwealth superannuation. Rather the Bill proposes some changes to bring the 1976 Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme into line with the Occupational Superannuation Standards; proposes some changes to streamline the administration of the Acts and the schemes; removes some anomalies in the benefit provisions of the current legislation, thereby providing greater equity between members; and makes some drafting amendments to clarify the intention of the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of the amendments are technical in nature. Most amendments relate to the 1976 Commonwealth scheme, the detail of which is set out in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Generally speaking, the amount of the benefits is neither increased nor reduced. An exception to this statement would be a potential increase in the amount of the benefit payable when a pensioner or contributor under the 1976 scheme dies leaving behind more than one spouse. Currently, no additional benefit is payable where there is more than one eligible spouse, for example, where a person in a de facto relationship is also supporting a separated legal spouse. The Bill proposes that, where there is more than one eligible spouse, the benefit available for allocation will be calculated by treating the additional spouses as if they were dependent children, subject to the same overall maximum that currently applies to spouse's and children's benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>Another exception would be amendments to remove the potential for some persons in certain circumstances to receive double benefits in respect of a period of service. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that there is a small number of provisions that are to be backdated. This has been done to protect the members' interests. An example is the amendment to the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act that enables benefits to be paid directly to the 1990 Commonwealth scheme, rather than going through an industry fund and incurring that fund's charges. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention some changes to bring the Commonwealth schemes into line with the Occupational Superannuation Standards. The Bill proposes the cessation of the cash-in-hand lump sum superannuation retrenchment benefit in the 1976 scheme from 1 July 2000. This amendment has been foreshadowed some time ago. Another amendment to the 1976 scheme resulting from the Standards is to provide persons who change employment after reaching their minimum retiring age with the option of postponing receipt of their pension until genuine retirement from the work force. An appropriately adjusted pension would be payable at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>Increasingly Commonwealth authorities are setting up their own superannuation schemes. The authorities usually give their Commonwealth scheme members the option of joining their new scheme. Where employees join the authority scheme, they cease membership of the Commonwealth scheme. Sometimes they join the authority scheme without any benefit for their past membership of the Commonwealth scheme. In the past, they have either been paid a benefit from the Commonwealth scheme or preserved their benefits in the Commonwealth scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The Standards do not permit the payment of superannuation scheme benefits to members when there is no change of employment, even though membership of a scheme may have ceased. Therefore, the Bill provides that the 1976 and 1990 scheme members who join an authority scheme authorised by the Minister for Finance in such circumstances are not to receive a cash benefit, but are to receive preserved benefits in the Commonwealth scheme. The normal five year qualification for preserved benefits in the 1976 scheme will be reduced to one year in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of amendments have been proposed to simplify and streamline administration and I give some examples. Functions relating to leave without pay and preservation have been transferred from the Minister for Finance to the Board of the 1976 scheme. The administration of the 1976 scheme is split between the Board and the Commissioner, but a transfer of functions to the Board is more consistent with the Occupational Superannuation Standards. A proposed amendment to the Superannuation (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act will mean that notice of certain changes to the Ministerial guidelines relating to superannuation schemes set up by Commonwealth authorities does not have to be served on employers not affected by the changes. Other proposed changes bring the administrative procedures under the 1976 and 1990 schemes into line. </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, the Bill proposes to replicate in the Superannuation Act 1990 certain provisions in the Superannuation Act 1976. The provisions relate to the bulk transfers of members from the 1990 Commonwealth scheme to a scheme set up by a Commonwealth authority where that new scheme gives credit for past Commonwealth scheme membership. The amendments provide for an orderly transfer of moneys from the Superannuation Fund of the 1990 Commonwealth scheme to the authority scheme, so that neither transferring nor remaining members are disadvantaged. The provisions also permit payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the authority scheme to help fund benefits in the authority scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>In my introduction, I mentioned that some amendments remove anomalies in the legislative provisions. One of the proposed amendments is backdated to 1986. The amendment corrects an anomaly in the provision relating to earnings by invalidity pensioners under the 1976 scheme. Currently, it is possible that a few invalidity pensioners can receive benefits based on one salary, but have the earnings test applied to a much lower salary. The amendment provides that the salary used for benefits is to be used for the earnings test. </PARA>
<PARA>Another amendment extends the Commissioner for Superannuation's powers to apportion benefits on the death of a pensioner or contributor under the 1976 scheme. This power is limited to cases where there are dependants from more than one relationship. A discretion to apportion benefits in such cases is the only practical approach. It would be impossible to lay down hard-and-fast rules to cover every combination of domestic relationships that could exist or arise. This power would also help remove some of the anomalies that can arise under the current legislation. For instance, it is possible for a spouse of a deceased contributor to the 1976 scheme to disentitle children from an earlier relationship who were not living with the deceased contributor. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to a proposed amendment that could be important to those members of the 1976 scheme who are deciding whether to transfer to the 1990 Commonwealth scheme or stay in the 1976 scheme. A Benefit Classification Certificate records the medical conditions existing at entry to the 1976 scheme. Should invalidity retirement or death be connected with one of these conditions, reduced benefits may be payable. In certain circumstances, the Commissioner may be required to issue certificates some time after a person has joined the scheme. For example, where medical reports are misplaced and not discovered until some time after entry. Such certificates, in effect, are issued retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be inequitable for a member to make a decision to stay or transfer on the assumption that he or she does not have a certificate, only to find that a certificate is later issued retrospectively. The Bill proposes a moratorium on the retrospective issue of certificates so that existing members of the 1976 scheme can make their decision with some certainty. The moratorium is to be effective from the 1 April 1991. The moratorium does not extend to cases where there has been non-disclosure of the relevant facts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides that the 1976 scheme Board will have the responsibility for setting the rate at which deductions will be made to productivity benefits because of tax paid by the Superannuation Fund. Productivity contributions are now included in the assessable income of the Fund and tax may be payable on that income. Although the nominal tax rate is 15 per cent, the rate of tax may vary from year-to-year as offsets are allowed against particular components of the Fund's assessable income, for example, investment losses. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, taxation payments are not made until after the end of the financial year to which the tax relates, but contributors may leave the scheme before the rate of tax is known. To leave the decision on the tax treatment to the Board, which consists of equal numbers of persons appointed from the employer and member side and an independent chair, would be consistent with the Occupational Superannuation Standards which place the day-to-day decisions of a scheme with the scheme trustees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also includes amendments to the Superannuation Acts 1976 and 1990 to clarify the arrangements to apply with regard to membership of the Commonwealth schemes. These amendments will ensure the availability of the broadest possible options for persons resuming Commonwealth employment with rights under the 1976 scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, there would be little to be gained by spelling out all the amendments proposed in the Bill. I mentioned at the outset that most of the amendments were of a technical nature and I have given some examples. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the financial impact of the Bill. It is impossible to quantify the financial impact of the proposed amendments. Some amendments have the potential to increase costs, while others may reduce costs. What can be said with some certainty is that any financial impact is likely to be small. This follows from the fact that most of the amendments with a financial impact would affect only a small number of persons. </PARA>
<PARA>Those amendments that would tend to increase costs include the moratorium on the issue of Benefit Classification Certificates and the additional pension that may be payable where there is more than one eligible spouse. Savings may result from the removal of the possibility of double benefits. There may be small administrative savings and additional revenue may arise from some further employers being asked to pay a share of the costs of running the schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendment that appears to have the most potential for financial impact is the inclusion in the 1990 scheme of provisions to enable payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund when bulk transfers of members to a separate scheme set up by a Commonwealth authority occur. However, the amendment could not have any financial impact until an authority with staff in the 1990 scheme sets up its own scheme and permits 1990 scheme members to transfer to that scheme and the scheme is approved by the Minister for Finance. Even then, the authority would have made payments to Consolidated Revenue to fund its Commonwealth scheme benefits. It is only appropriate that, when an authority provides its own superannuation benefits, it gains access to an appropriate share of past moneys paid. Finally, the payments from Consolidated Revenue under such an arrangement are spread out over a long period, possibly up to forty years, thereby protecting the Budget from any significant short-term outlays. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed in the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991 will provide for the registration and regulation of B-Double combinations under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is aware that Australia needs a transport system that is competitive, delivers a high quality of service and makes efficient use of an infrastructure which is one of the community's largest investments. To this end, we are actively pursuing a program of reform for the land transport sector to complement reforms already under way in the coastal shipping, waterfront and aviation sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>The objective of this reform is to develop a land transport system that is competitive between modes, is more efficient in its allocation of resources, achieves greater operational productivity and promotes harmonised road transport regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government recognises the considerable productivity, safety and environmental benefits offered by B-Doubles. The introduction of B-Doubles on a national basis is therefore an integral part of the Government's reform strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>B-Doubles offer a number of benefits to operators and the community as a whole over existing heavy vehicle technology. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, B-Doubles have a payload of 37 tonnes compared to a conventional articulated vehicle with a payload of 26 tonnes. This represents payload and productivity gains of 40 percent. After taking account of additional capital costs for B-Double vehicles and other costs of operation, efficiency improvements are of the order of 20 percent, a substantial gain for the road transport operator. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the competitive nature of the road transport industry these gains can be expected to be passed on in the form of lower freight charges. This will have beneficial financial effects for manufacturing and other businesses and will be reflected in the transport costs for bulk commodities such as fuel and consumer goods. Finally, and most importantly, the consumer will benefit as these lower input costs flow through to prices on the shop shelf. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only is the B-Double a more efficient vehicle, but better road safety results from its improved stability. B-Doubles are estimated to have 25 percent higher roll-over limit than conventional articulated vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional benefits from the use of B-Doubles arise from the fact that fewer vehicles are required to undertake a given freight task. This results in improved road safety due to fewer vehicles on the road and an improved urban environment with less traffic congestion and reduced truck noise and exhaust emissions. As an example, only 27 B-Doubles are needed to carry 1 000 tonnes of freight whereas 38 conventional articulated vehicles would be required to do the same task. </PARA>
<PARA>With fewer B-Doubles required to complete a given freight task, there would also be no increase in the damage caused to roads than if articulated vehicles were used. </PARA>
<PARA>All States and Territories allow for the operation of B-Doubles on designated routes except Tasmania which does not allow the use of these vehicles on their roads. These States and Territories, however, impose their own requirements and conditions on B-Double operations. The conditions imposed by Victoria being the most restrictive. </PARA>
<PARA>In order for the full potential of the benefits offered by B-Doubles to be realised, it is necessary for them to operate on a uniform basis across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, in view of the significant benefits to be gained from the wider use of B-Doubles, the Minister for Land Transport, Bob Brown, announced in October last year that the Interstate Road Transport legislation would be amended to include B-Doubles. The Bill now before the House does this. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal registration of B-Doubles will provide for the operation of these vehicles in all States and Territories of Australia, will allow for the operation of B-Doubles under harmonised regulatory arrangements throughout Australia and will allow for the development of a national B-Double network which complements our efforts to increase efficiency at transport interfaces. </PARA>
<PARA>It is expected that the introduction of B-Doubles under FIRS for interstate tasks will provide significant impetus for the wider introduction of these vehicles by all jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA>Their introduction under FIRS will also enable their early operation on a national basis pending the establishment of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed arrangements for the operation of B-Doubles under FIRS have been determined through a consultative process involving State and Territory governments, local government and industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The incorporation of B-Doubles under FIRS would be accompanied by appropriate cost recovery arrangements to ensure that operators of these vehicles make a reasonable contribution to the wear they impose on the road system. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me now turn to the individual amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal amendments in the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill provide for a new registration category for B-Double prime movers. The amendments also provide for the regulation of a B-Double combination comprising a B-Double prime mover registered under the Act with either State or Federally registered trailers. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 5 provides a head of power enabling regulations to be made which regulate the operation of B-Doubles. These operating conditions will cover mass limits, in-service requirements, designation of routes and any conditions which are imposed on operations on these routes. </PARA>
<PARA>The States have generally agreed to in-service requirements for the operation of B-Doubles. These will cover matters such as braking and coupling requirements, spray suppression equipment, dimension limits, axle spacing and road speed capabilities. These requirements are aimed at ensuring that B-Double operations occur under conditions which are safe for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>A national B-Double network is being developed in consultation with State and local government and industry. The proposed network will incorporate major interstate routes as well as connections to areas of industrial concentration and with ports, depots and rail heads. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 5 also expressly exempts B-Double combinations operating under the legislation from the need to obtain State permits for B-Double operations. </PARA>
<PARA>Further amendments set out the penalties for offences against mass limit provisions for B-Doubles. </PARA>
<PARA>The penalty applying to an individual is $4 000. Consistent with the provisions of the Crimes Act, the proposed penalty for an overloading offence involving a B-Double in the case of a body corporate will therefore be $20 000. This level of penalty has been set on the basis of equity and deterrent value. </PARA>
<PARA>Setting the maximum fine for a body corporate at $20 000 will enable fines under FIRS to be consistent with the States and provide a sufficient deterrent to operators deliberately overloading B-Doubles to secure increased profits. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequential amendments are required to the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act. They will enable the Government to set registration charges for B-Doubles on a full cost recovery basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The remaining amendments increase the level of infringement notice penalty for overloading for an individual to $400. Penalties for offences other than overloading under the Act and Regulations will be increased to $1 000. </PARA>
<PARA>The Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill provides for the amendments to come into force on a day to be set by Proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA>The net budgetary impact of these amendments will be nil. All registration charges will be paid into the Interstate Road Transport Trust Fund and will continue to be fully distributed to the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>All administrative costs incurred by State and Territory authorities administering the Scheme are met through the levying of fees. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of B-Doubles on a national basis forms an integral part of the Federal Government's land transport reform strategy. Resultant productivity gains should encourage greater competition and lower prices for transport services, objectives consistent with the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for the transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 to enable registration charges for B-Double prime movers registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) to be determined on the basis of full cost recovery and to remove existing limits on registration charges. </PARA>
<PARA>It is proposed to determine B-Double registration charges on the basis of full cost recovery, consistent with the Federal Government's objective to achieve full cost recovery in the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA>This will mean that B-Double charges under FIRS will be consistent with those charges applying in the States. In particular, Federally registered B-Doubles will not be given concessional treatment in comparison to charges applying in NSW and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985, registration charges are determined on the basis of maintenance costs only. </PARA>
<PARA>A reinterpretation of Section 92 of the Constitution by the High Court in 1988 means that construction costs can be included in the determination of Federal registration charges under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that it is not proposed to review registration charges for existing categories of vehicles on the basis of full cost recovery at this time. Revised charges for these categories of vehicles will be considered in the context of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that industry has the opportunity to reap significant efficiency gains through the operation of B-Doubles on a national basis, it is reasonable to expect that they be prepared to accept the costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now turn to the individual amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3 of the Bill removes the provision of the Act which limits the determination of registration charges to maintenance costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments also provide for the provisions of the Act which specify the maximum charges to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>This will enable the Government to set registration charges for B-Doubles on a full cost recovery basis. </PARA>
<PARA>While it is not proposed to review existing charges on the basis of full cost recovery in these amendments, it is not appropriate to amend the Act so that there are two separate sets of charging principles-one for B-Doubles and one for all other categories. </PARA>
<PARA>The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill provides for the amendments to come into force on a day to be set by Proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA>The net budgetary impact of these amendments will be nil. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill should be read in conjunction with the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>FOREIGN JUDGMENTS BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Foreign Judgments Bill will provide a framework for the enforcement of foreign civil judgments in Australia by a simple registration process. The Bill will replace existing State and Territory legislation governing registration and enforcement of foreign civil judgments in State and Territory Supreme Courts. </PARA>
<PARA>It will also implement arrangements agreed with New Zealand as part of Closer Economic Relations, and an Agreement entered into with the United Kingdom last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Having Commonwealth legislation, rather than separate State and Territory laws will provide greater efficiency in negotiating and implementing arrangements with other countries for enforcement of judgments, and will permit better use of resources. The introduction of Commonwealth legislation has received general support from State and Territory Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>Consultative arrangements that have been developed between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories will continue. The Commonwealth will consult the States and Territories before entering into any arrangement with another country for enforcement of civil judgments. </PARA>
<PARA>At present foreign judgments can be enforced in Australia either by bringing an action at common law based on the judgment, or by registering the judgment in a State or Territory Supreme Court under State or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA>Most State and Territory laws providing for enforcement of foreign judgments are substantially uniform, being based on the United Kingdom Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933. </PARA>
<PARA>The uniform legislation is based on the principle of reciprocity. It provides for registration, in the Supreme Court of a State or Territory, of money judgments given by the superior courts of a foreign country to which the legislation is applied. The legislation may be applied by instrument with respect to a foreign country, where that foreign country gives substantial reciprocity of treatment to judgments of the relevant State or Territory Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA>A judgment is not registrable under the uniform legislation unless it is final and conclusive, is for a sum of money (other than a sum in respect of a revenue debt, fine or other penalty) and is enforceable by execution in the foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA>Once registered, a judgment has the same force and effect, for the purposes of execution, as if the judgment had been originally given in the registering court. </PARA>
<PARA>The uniform legislation contains safeguards which enable registration of a judgment to be set aside in certain circumstances. These include an inappropriate assertion of jurisdiction by the foreign court, public policy and registration in contravention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is based on the legislative scheme reflected in the uniform State and Territory legislation. The problem with the current scheme has not been the legislation itself but rather the multiplication of effort involved in implementing and keeping arrangements up to date under the various State and Territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the current scheme there is invariably a long delay in implementing arrangements in all jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA>Other problems that have arisen with a scheme based on State and Territory legislation are lack of uniformity in the arrangements made with other countries and lack of capacity adequately to deal with judgments of Australian federal courts. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth legislation will facilitate negotiations, enable satisfactory arrangements to be made for judgments of all Australian superior courts, increase efficiency and reduce resource needs. At the same time, the State and Territory Supreme Courts will continue their role under the present law for enforcement of foreign judgments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will widen the scope of the judgments enforceable under the current uniform scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to providing for the enforcement of money judgments of foreign superior courts, the Bill provides for:</PARA>
<PARA>* Enforcement of judgments of foreign inferior courts where the foreign country provides reciprocal treatment for Australian inferior court judgments agreements on this have been reached with New Zealand and the United Kingdom;</PARA>
<PARA>* Enforcement of foreign non-money judgments (for example, injunctions) also on the basis of reciprocity, by registration in the same manner as money judgments-agreement on this has been reached with New Zealand; and</PARA>
<PARA>* Enforcement of New Zealand revenue judgments (including penalty components of such judgments) in the same manner as civil money judgments. Revenue debts include income tax, capital gains tax and customs duty. </PARA>
<PARA>Considerations of justice, convenience, greater certainty in international transactions and comity between nations show the desirability of the scheme reflected in this Bill. With the increasing mobility of persons and money across borders, the need for, and benefits of, an effective capacity to enable a judgment given in one country to be enforced against assets in another country are obvious. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is a good example of the efficiencies that can be achieved through Commonwealth, State and Territory co-operation in allocation of functions. While the Commonwealth legislation will replace State and Territory legislation, the States and Territories will still be directly involved through the consultative process on proposed arrangements with foreign countries, and in the continued enforcement of foreign judgments in their courts. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not expected that the Bill will have a significant financial impact. The Bill will permit some resource savings for the Commonwealth, States and Territories by removing multiplication of effort involved in each State and Territory having to implement arrangements under its own law. In the short to medium term savings at the Commonwealth level will be offset by the need to bring existing arrangements under the Commonwealth Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion by (Senator McMullan) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991 be listed on the Notice Paper as an order of the day, and the remaining Bills be listed as separate orders of the day. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Telecommunications Bill 1991 be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>I understood this measure was not going to be debated in the Committee of the Whole until we had all the amendments before us. If any legislation should be earmarked for scrutiny by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, it is this legislation. There are a considerable number of amendments that need consideration. My amendments, for example, have not yet been distributed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, my amendments have not even been distributed. These measures should have been sent to the Standing Committee. Time and time again honourable senators have said that the committee system should be used to ensure that legislation and amendments are properly scrutinised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How can the Committee of the Whole properly scrutinise these measures if the amendments are not even before us? That is a matter of great concern. This measure came over to this chamber I think on Tuesday this week. When I focused on the measure and saw that there needed to be some amendment-I mentioned this in the second reading debate which concluded this morning-I gave instructions last night for certain amendments to be drawn up. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that people have been working very hard on those amendments to try to get them properly before the Committee. They are due to be circulated shortly but it is most unfortunate that the Senate has before it measures which really should go through the committee system. If the committee system is going to be worth anything and if people are fair dinkum around this place about the committee system, then this is one measure that should go to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not require this measure to go through tonight-and it should explain why it needs it tonight-rather than when we come back in a week's time. This matter obviously has got to go before the House of Representatives again when the lower House is called back. What reason does the Government have for requiring the legislation tonight, instead of having the usual procedure adopted for the measure to be brought before the appropriate committee? I do not want any delays but it is important that the matters and the amendments are properly considered. I believe that this matter should be sent to the Committee in accordance with all of the statements that have been made by the Opposition, by the Democrats and by the Government about the importance of these legislative committees to scrutinise Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to indicate that the Government will be opposing this proposal for very clear reasons. This legislation will have to go back to the House of Representatives because it will have to consider the very large number of amendments that we will be moving. The Government will accept a number of those Opposition amendments and it will also accept a number of the Australian Democrats' amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, we will not be accepting Senator Harradine's amendments simply because this is an entirely inappropriate vehicle for them. They are to do with the 0055 service. These Bills, of course, deal with the entire structural reorganisation of the organisation. I know that Senator Harradine has suggested that this Bill is being pushed through Parliament with unseemly haste but that simply cannot be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> If people were serious about this matter they would know that this Bill has been through an extraordinarily detailed and extensive consultative process. I must say that pre-eminent among the people who have contributed to that process has been the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. An exposure draft of this Bill was prepared as long ago as February this year. It has been around that long. A large number of submissions were received from a very large number of organisations including, as I said before, the Opposition and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I also add that not one solitary submission was received on the question of 0055, despite the fact that both the public and, indeed, the Senate had a very good crack at putting in submissions. All the submissions received very detailed and careful consideration by the Government. Indeed, the Government has been extensively praised for the way in which it has treated all of those submissions; in fact, widespread praise for the constructive way that all of the suggestions we have received have been handled. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine approached me, as he said, last night and told me that he wanted to move amendments on 0055. I am in the position that-like Monsieur Arouet-whilst I disagree with everything Senator Harradine has to say, I certainly defend to the death his right to say it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed I would. As Senator Harradine knows, I immediately organised some extensive assistance for him, even though I got very late notice. The Government has given extensive assistance to Senator Harradine-which he has acknowledged-and a lot of work has been put into it today to prepare his amendments, which are currently being printed. As I say again, this matter has been around since February. A great deal of consultation has gone on with this legislation and the Government has responded positively to it. The draft exposure Bill was released in February but not a single submission was received on this matter of the 0055 numbers, despite the fact that we received hundreds of submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite all of that and despite the late notice, Senator Harradine has been provided-as he has acknowledged-with a great deal of assistance. But I indicate that this is a very inappropriate matter to support because of that background. Secondly, it is an entirely inappropriate vehicle for the kind of amendments that Senator Harradine wants to move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just very briefly: I have heard Senator Harradine's remarks about referring the whole package of these telecommunications Bills and, of course, the explanatory memoranda to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure because, as I understand it, he is concerned about 0055 numbers. I agree with Senator Collins: it is a totally inappropriate process. It is a classic example of trying to take a sledge-hammer to solve a problem that Senator Harradine has which, in my view, is about the size of a small pea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Wednesday 29 May the Bills were introduced and the second reading speeches were incorporated, which is eight days ago. In view of the specific concerns that Senator Harradine has had, I would have thought that eight days is not too bad a time to get his amendments prepared so that they would be ready for the committee stages. He wants to refer the whole package of these Bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure to deal with his specific points; I am not even sure that is the relevant committee-and I am a member of that committee-in which to deal with the issues which Senator Harradine wishes to raise. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the ministerial advisory council established by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) last year with representatives of the whole range of interest groups in telecommunications, I cannot recollect any of those meetings, and we had many, where people were concerned-as Senator Harradine is-about 0055 numbers. That is not to say that there are not some people in the community concerned about it. But we were concerned about dealing with a new structure for telecommunications in Australia and not about the morality of the use of 0055 numbers for certain services that the honourable senator is offended by. </PARA>
<PARA> I would appeal to Senator Harradine that it is still not too late to be able to debate his amendments because we are going to be debating other amendments in these Bills-which will not be completed tonight-when we come back here the week after next. So he has got plenty of time to put his case, even though I think his amendments are inappropriate for this whole package that we are dealing with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen them yet but, in view of what the honourable senator has said in his speech on the second reading and elsewhere, I have a fair idea what they will contain. When a lot of people, including the Opposition and the Democrats as well as the Government and the industry, have spent something like 12 months preparing this whole package, I do not think that it is appropriate suddenly to send it off to the Senate Standing Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are deadlines to be met, which can be met if the processes are allowed to move effectively through this House, and through the other place, over the next couple of weeks. I strongly oppose the honourable senator's suggestion, particularly as a person who sat through more meetings than I care to count with the industry drawing up this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should indicate the attitude of the Opposition on this matter. We will not be supporting the motion. Indeed, I had naively thought that the matter would be completed tonight. The only explanation for the fact that Senator Schacht found it necessary to get up and repeat precisely what Senator Collins had said seems to be that he has formed a view that this legislation will not be disposed of this evening and perhaps that was part of ensuring that that was so.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The boot is often on the other foot, I might say. Senator Collins is very good at undermining others. Let me simply say from our side that we have considerable sympathy with what Senator Harradine is seeking to achieve. I understood that the reason why the committee stage has come on at so late an hour in the day was that we had been waiting for Senator Harradine's amendments to be in final form, that that was what was holding the matter up and that was what Senator Harradine was wanting to accomplish rather than to move a motion that the whole of the Telecommunications Bill and allied Bills go off to a committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On that basis I think that Senator Harradine is really concerned to have more time in which to have all parties consider the merits of his suggestions. If the committee stage will not be completed tonight, that stratagem will have been accomplished. We will certainly take advantage of that time to give the legislation every consideration and to assess what might be the most appropriate means of accommodating Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say now, rather than perhaps later, that it seems to me that there are a number of important matters to be considered other than simply deciding that a code of conduct is necessary and then tacking it onto this legislation. It may well be that others would want to take the view-and we would want to seek advice on this-that Austel is essentially a technical regulator concerned with matters of economics and science rather than with some of the controversial aspects of social policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Those matters ought to be more properly dealt with by a broadcasting regulator, be it the current Australian Broadcasting Tribunal or its successor in title, the standards authority or whatever else. In that way it may be the case that Senator Harradine would end up having a specialist body that would be able to address these radio, television and telephone issues in a more comprehensive manner, rather than essentially having an industry regulator being required from time to time to make social policy judgments. I simply indicate that we will not support the motion, but we are very concerned to see whether there are other ways and means in which Senator Harradine's objective might be accomplished. </PARA>

It is very difficult when a parliamentarian is one of a small number. I do also acknowledge that we did have an exposure draft of this legislation and we have had some time to have input to it. I understand what Senator Harradine is trying to achieve. I have some sympathy for his right to find the most appropriate piece of legislation in which to pursue this matter and I certainly do not want to make it unnecessarily difficult for him. However, I am persuaded, too, that this is not the appropriate piece of legislation and, therefore, I have to say that I cannot support his motion to send the Telecommunications Bill and allied Bills to a committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

All speakers in the second reading debate stage have said that the telecommunications industry is going to affect the daily lives of every citizen in Australia; and it does; and it will affect them more and more. Honourable senators have said that. They have all admitted it. They have said that Austel ought to be a regulatory authority for the environment in which these--</PARA></TALK.START>

If honourable senators do not agree with this, the second carrier will be able to do what it likes with no regulatory control at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want members of the Opposition to understand this because what they are doing here and now is to ensure that they do not give an opportunity to their backbenchers to understand what this is all about. What I am asking is very simple and very reasonable. I did not accuse the Government, as Senator Collins suggested, of unseemly haste. I did not do that. I am simply asking that the normal process be observed, and the normal process as was agreed around the place was that instead of having amendments coming before the Committee of the Whole, the Bill, together with amendments, go off to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the argument that was put forward by the Opposition and the Democrats. Why on this occasion should that not still occur? There are dozens of amendments. Despite all of the consultations that have taken place, dozens of amendments are now tabled to this legislation. Why should it not go to a committee? The Government has not given us any valid reason as to why it should be dealt with tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richard Alston ought to know that we are not pulling stumps at half past 10 tonight. Presumably this measure will be determined tonight. I am saying to the Opposition: give yourselves the chance to understand what this is all about. It is about a very grave matter of principle, about which many of the Opposition senators are very concerned. Here is the opportunity to do something about it. All I want is to ensure that a standing committee runs its eyes over this legislation so that we could call the Department of Transport and Communications, and call various other interested groups, to see what they thought about it. The thought that some other regulatory body can do anything about it is a fallacy. It will not occur. Honourable senators have the opportunity tonight and I am asking all of them to vote for this measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This clause as it stands in the Bill deals with a change in the network termination point in 1993 from the wall socket, where it now is, to a point outside the property boundary by regulation. We do not agree with that. We certainly do not want that to happen by regulation. We think that consumers will have to arrange their own cabling inside the property, and this will lead to so many questions. For example, with whom does the fault lie-is it the exchange, the cable, the subcontractor-whose responsibility is it if the line fails, who pays? All those sorts of questions will arise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be supporting the clause as printed. The removal of the clause would prevent the legislation being updated in a flexible manner to keep up with rapid technological change. Rapid changes are occurring in the development of radio-based telecommunications systems, and the Bill in clauses 6 to 9 sets out in detail the boundaries of line networks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 10 sets out the boundary for radio communication networks. The pace of technological change, as I have said, is extremely fast, and it is quite likely that regulations will be needed to flesh out the network boundaries in more detail, particularly in relation to radio communication systems as they continue to develop. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will be disallowable by the Parliament. Providing for modification of the boundaries by regulation would appear to strike an appropriate balance between the necessary need for flexibility in the face of technological change and the remaining involvement of this Parliament in terms of its oversight power in disallowing regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this matter of the termination point, I do not think in any debate over the past year, in the great sum of things that we are doing in telecommunications, that I have come across a matter that has been more hotly disputed than this specific point. It all has to do with the fact that we are dealing with an industry that has been in a monopoly position. It has been run very much as a public service for such a long time, with public service attitudes about regulation. I think that the Government's proposal is the best. Instead of trying to do what the Australian Democrats are suggesting and leaving the matter as it is, or doing what Senator Alston for the Opposition is suggesting and leaving the connection at the barge board, Senator Collins is quite correct to say that technologies are changing and that we should not put a prescription in the regulation or in the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Circumstances in the 1990s will change rapidly, but certainly the Government has indicated that there should be an orderly process of change in this area which has been negotiated in discussion with the unions and the management. Although the unions do not like the proposal-and one can anticipate why, because it changes a longstanding work practice in the industry-I think that they accept that there will be changes. They have a couple of years in which to adjust. I do not think there will be a cataclysmic loss of employment as a result of these changes of arrangements after 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Bill's provisions should be left flexible. Clearly, the Government has to bring in regulations to lay down whether the connection will be at the socket, the barge board or the property boundary. Whichever one it is, it will be debated here at an appropriate time and can be changed under regulation. I think that is the sort of flexibility that is needed rather than putting it down now in a prescriptive way. I would expect that much of the concern that has been expressed, particularly that by unions, can be addressed in the next couple of years. I expect that the loss of jobs will not be as catastrophic as the unions fear as a result of this change. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the technological changes that are occurring mean that even the unions recognise that what was appropriate for the old copper wire system in telephone connections 20 or 30 years ago obviously will be under dramatic challenge when the cellular mobile system of telephones extends widely and other new technologies are introduced. Therefore, much of this argument may be unnecessary because the jobs that would be lost here will be made up elsewhere in the system as people adapt to the new technologies. I think that the Government has the right balance in its proposal, and I do not think that we should be as restrictive as either the Democrats or the Opposition propose. </PARA>

<PARA> ``33A. This Act has effect subject to the Broadcasting Act 1942.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that there is not a lot of support for what I am proposing in this amendment. Nevertheless, I want to make a point about it. Clause 33 exempts the Radiocommunications Act 1983 but not the Broadcasting Act 1942. We see a potential conflict between Austel's role and that of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which are both statutory authorities and have the power to control the technical requirements of the broadcasting industry. We think that there is a public interest issue here and an opportunity to change this in the Broadcasting Act review. The fact that the Minister is to issue a directive to Austel to tell it not to use its power over the Broadcasting Act is really not the point. We think that the whole matter ought to be transparent in the Bill. I think there are enough problems in the Broadcasting Act and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal without adding another one to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will be opposing this amendment. We do not think it is reasonable to make the Telecommunications Act subject to the Broadcasting Act. They have quite separate objectives and while any overlap between the two regimes is minimal, it really does not make much sense to arbitrarily subject one to the other. This may result in the famous `unintended consequences'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not clear what the Australian Democrats are trying to achieve, despite the explanation that has just been given. If the Democrats are trying to protect the broadcasters from having to comply with technical compliance obligations under the Telecommunications Act, this may be convenient for broadcasters but it will not necessarily serve the interests of protecting the safety and integrity of the public telecommunications network. If Austel imposes safety restrictions on the use of lines, why should the broadcasters be exempt from these requirements if they are necessary to protect the telecommunications network? I cannot understand, therefore, why the Democrats are looking after the interests of the commercial broadcasters in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Any additional obligations that Austel would be likely to impose on the broadcasters would relate to their use of lines. It would certainly not be appropriate to allow broadcasters to be exempted from the provisions of the Telecommunications Act governing resale and the provision of value added services on their networks. Any difficulties with the transmission that result in interference are dealt with under the Radiocommunications Act to which the Telecommunications Bill remains subject. </PARA>

The only thought that occurred to me was that perhaps she has in mind that if and when we ever get around to pay television in this country, the Broadcasting Act 1942 may somehow be used to override provisions relating to the delivery of those services that would otherwise have been provided through the telecommunications system and, therefore, regulated by Austel. Although I do not think that one should have an iron view on the matter to the extent that the two should never overlap-and I refer in particular to what Senator Harradine has been indicating tonight, that there may well be a case for giving the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal certain powers in relation to certain subject matter-I certainly do not think that one should have a blanket approach, and certainly not on the basis of what we have heard tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats' amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This Act has effect subject to the Broadcasting Act 1942. </PARA>
<PARA>It means, I assume, that the Broadcasting Act 1942 has precedence over the provisions of this legislation in so far as it affects broadcasting. I do not know-I think there is something to be said for that proposition provided that the same technical standards, or safety standards as the Minister indicated, were required of commercial broadcasters under that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not actually had the matter explained to me clearly, but I take up the point that was made by Senator Alston and reiterate the logic of the position that I mentioned previously. In respect of standards, for example, if we do not have Austel as a regulatory authority, we have absolutely nobody. Even if the Democrats' amendment were carried, I do not see that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal would be able to come into the situation with regard to message content, standards, codes of conduct and the rest. </PARA>
<PARA> Really we are back to the situation, irrespective of whether this amendment is carried or whether it is not, where it is only the technical environment that is actually regulated by Austel. That is despite the fact that Telecom Australia itself-and I want people to understand this-has been anxious for Austel to be involved in this question of code of conduct. Of course it would, for two reasons. The first is that it is an outside body-it is a regulatory body. Secondly, if it is not going to regulate the code of conduct, the new player-the new carrier-will be able to do anything it likes. I only raise this because it has been raised by Senator Richard Alston. I say that this idea that some time in the future the Broadcasting Tribunal may be able to be the regulatory authority with respect to this question is an absolute furphy. The Senate has the chance to do something about it tonight, and I hope it does. </PARA>

I could not, for a moment, predict the consequences that might flow from making every aspect of telecommunications subject to the whims of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The Tribunal is not qualified to make technical judgments. If it happens to be able to identify some jurisdiction that it can exercise, one would have thought that it would probably feel compelled to exercise it, and we would have an unholy conflict on our hands in a whole range of areas. I would have thought that if there is one single way of making the whole industry unworkable, it would be to have blanket authority conveyed in that way. Whilst, again, I think there may, and there should, be other ways of addressing Senator Harradine's specific concern, it is certainly not well addressed by giving a comprehensive and virtually unlimited power to the Tribunal in the manner proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>

In that process that the Government will be going through it will be calling for public submissions and I suggest they should take that opportunity to put submissions forward at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspect what Senator Harradine is actually suggesting would mean that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal would become an equivalent of the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, in the United States, which is really embarking upon quite a different regulatory body which is an enormous bureaucracy in that country.

I think we ought to take small bites of the apple and see how we go with Austel for a while.

It is quite obvious that a regulatory authority like Austel should have the power to allocate numbering. I was saying that, as I understand it, Austel in a monopoly situation already has that power. I am asking the Minister quite directly: is it a fact that if Telecom, as a monopoly, requires a new numbering system for an opt-in service, it is required to make application to Austel and for that application to be approved by Austel prior to the allocation of that new numbering system?</PARA></TALK.START>

I must say that I am heartened by the fairly dramatic change of attitude on the part of the Government over the last 12 months in this whole area of competition. That is why it is particularly important that we should be concerned that all functions of the Australian Telecommunications Authority (Austel), including reviewing, not just those relating to the development of standards, which is what the Democrat amendment goes to, ought to be guided by best international practice. That is something that has simply not been happening in this country to date. That is why I regard this as a fundamentally important motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this amendment is carried, for the first time in many ways it will expose us to the real world. It will mean that we will have to measure ourselves against the rest of the world, not against where the Government was 12 months ago, which was opposed to competition or any sort of international comparisons and was merely looking back. This amendment will enable us to look forward at output and to ensure that, for the first time, we will have a system that is driven by the best possible alternatives. That will be a tremendous breakthrough. I am delighted that it would seem that the Government will be supporting that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> In many respects, in terms of carrier performance, we have already given the rest of the world some seven years. This is a very good opportunity for Austel to keep the weights on both carriers and to ensure that, when the Minister is receiving reports, and hopefully when he is passing those reports on to the Parliament, we will be able to make our own proper comparative judgments and not simply relevant ones that might state that we have made progress from where we were the year before. </PARA>

It may be that a lot of unnecessary time would be wasted in appeals being launched on a misconceived basis. Therefore, we think it is extremely regrettable that the concept of justice that does require reasons to be provided, which is otherwise so well embedded in many other areas of the law, has managed to escape the Government in this instance. I can understand the Government wanting to restrict rights of appeal and to put time limits, but surely the day has long since passed when a tribunal can simply say, `Guilty, and I'm not telling you why', or `No, and I won't explain myself'. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government will be opposing this amendment. It is completely unnecessary and it simply restricts the necessary commercial freedom that the organisation has to have. The reason that I make that point-so that I do not have to reiterate it at length elsewhere-is that there is a whole series of amendments that the Australian Democrats are moving in a similar vein which will effectively put the Senate in charge of running the organisation. With the greatest respect to the Senate, we do have a particular and important role to play in Australia, but I do not think that we are the best organisation in the world to make a continuing range of essential commercial decisions, which the organisation has to make. It will be publicly accountable for doing that and will either stand or fall on it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to point out to the Committee that this amendment just does not stand on its own. There is a whole series of these amendments which require absolutely everything to be subject to disallowance and debate in the Senate chamber.

Clause 61 is in relation to the delegation of powers, not the actual exercise of those powers once delegated. It is the delegation of the power, which could be quite a broad power, which would simply come under review and be disallowable, but not the exercise of the power. If the Minister decided to grant quite wide-sweeping commercial powers to Austel, the decision would be whether it was appropriate to delegate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, I am not misunderstanding the import at all. It is, indeed, a wide-sweeping restraint that this amendment would place on the operations of the organisation. The Minister can, by right, delegate to Austel and that direction will be made subject to parliamentary disallowance. I do not expect two things: I do not expect the Minister to run Austel, neither does he, and that is why he will have to delegate; nor do I expect that the Senate chamber should appropriately run Austel. I did correctly point out, and Senator Kernot agreed across the chamber, that this is one of a number of Democrat amendments that provide for all of these matters to be brought back to the Senate for debate and potential disallowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just do not think it is appropriate. It is not a secret organisation. The operations will be right up there for everyone to see.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The task of calculating percentages of students on AUSTUDY by institution would require a very large allocation of resources, but it would only produce a partial answer because student data is not yet available for 1991 and is not held on government secondary schools for 1990. It is considered that this allocation of resources is not warranted at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) &amp;(3) The rate of payment received by any individual client is determined by the income of the student, the adjusted parent income or spouse income.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to identify those on part payment on a yearly basis because a range of other factors can impact on whether or not a person appears to have received part payment for the year. These include those clients who turn 16 part the way through the year, those who discontinue their studies and those who may be repaying an overpayment.</PARA>
<PARA> The table below provides a picture for the month of April 1991. The percentages of students on part payment during April would be typical of the situation over a full year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Standards of public hygiene, including the handling and preparation of foods, and of the treatment of water supplies and sewage are adequate to prevent an outbreak of cholera in Australia. Cholera is a quarantinable disease under the Quarantine Act 1908 and persons suffering from cholera on entry to Australia are placed under quarantine. Cholera is effectively treated with modern drug regimes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Cholera vaccine does not prevent the spread of cholera from person to person, it has minimal efficacy and a short duration of action. Neither the World Health Organization nor Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council recommends use of the vaccine. Both these bodies recommend that emphasis should be placed on personal hygiene measures, particularly in the selection and handling of food and water where cholera is a risk. Australia has adequate resources to manage the unlikely event of a cholera epidemic.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) For the reasons given above, no restrictions are in place to ensure that persons travelling to or from cholera infected areas are vaccinated against cholera.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Cholera symptoms are variable from patient to patient and the disease would not necessarily be identifiable in a person with mild symptoms on landing in Australia. Passengers reporting illness on landing are routinely referred to Commonwealth Medical Officers to investigate the possibility of quarantinable disease. If cholera is suspected, arrangements are made for confirmatory tests and treatment in hospital. Customs and quarantine officers at international ports of entry to Australia routinely seek advice from Commonwealth Medical Officers when they detect a passenger who shows signs or symptoms of any illness.</PARA>

<PARA>(1) What is the estimate of the amount of oil that has spilled and is currently pouring into the Persian Gulf from Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What methods are being used to clean up the oil spills.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is Australia assisting Kuwait with the `clean up'.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4639" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Estimates of the spill size range between 5 million and 11 million barrels of oil (795,000-1,745,000 tonnes). As the release of oil occurred in a war situation it has not been possible to determine an accurate figure. Oil continues to escape into the Arabian Gulf from a number of sources off Kuwait and Iraq at an estimated rate of 1500 to 6000 barrels per day.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A variety of resources have been used to recover the oil, including offshore and inshore skimming vessels, static skimmers and vacuum trucks. A large offshore skimming vessel was used to collect oil off the Saudi Arabian coast in the early days of the spill before the slick moved inshore into shallower waters. It was not possible to operate this vessel off the Kuwaiti coast due to the threat of mines. Inshore operations were carried out in those areas where the oil concentrated either naturally or with the help of oil spill containment booms and sand berms. In these areas smaller skimmer units and vacuum trucks were used to recover large quantities of free floating oil. Recovered oil is being taken away for reprocessing in some instances and elsewhere it is being stored in large pits for subsequent disposal.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has responded in a positive manner to assist the Gulf clean up operations by sending experts and equipment to Saudi Arabia. This commenced on 4 March 1991 following a request by the Government of Saudi Arabia for international assistance. So far Australian oil pollution experts from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the Australian Institute of Petroleum and State marine authorities have been sent to Saudi Arabia on a rotation basis to act as advisers to local oil spill response authorities. This assistance is continuing. Australia has also donated two skimmers to the Government of Saudi Arabia to assist in oil recovery operations.</PARA>
