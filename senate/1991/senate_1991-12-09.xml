<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will tell the truth, which is more than we are getting from the Government side. This last weekend, rather than attempt to debate the coalition's Fightback program on its merits, Mr Hawke stooped to the lowest level imaginable by seeking to attack it as un-Australian. In doing so, in exhibiting that level of desperation, he forfeited the last shreds of legitimacy that he might have to the highest office in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an action lower than his lies to the Australian people over his secret deal with Paul Keating, which he of course welshed upon when it came to the crunch. It was even lower than when he cut John Kerin's throat last Friday in an enfeebled attempt to answer the charge of old jellyback which is so often deliberately put to him by his own colleagues. In attacking the Opposition with no substantial economic argument, offering no alternative but rather labelling us and the millions of Australians we represent as un-Australian, he sought to invoke the deepest fears in ordinary Australians, and sank to the lowest level of shame in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He does not want an economic debate. He does not want a political debate. He is now a man who has lost touch with reality&mdash;a man who has told himself so often that he has a special relationship with the Australian people that he now believes it, a man whom his mates call `little Caesar' and who now sees himself as an emperor, and a man who sees a threat to his leadership as a threat to Australians. That is the trouble with Hawke. He now personifies himself so much with the future of this country that he sees a threat to his leadership as a threat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This man, who has built his appeal about personifying so much of what is good about Australia&mdash;the outdoor spirit, a certain sense of larrikinism, a happy-go-lucky atmosphere &mdash;and out of it claiming that the Australian people have vested in him a certain trust, has betrayed that trust. He has led the Australian people down a path of hopelessness and despair and yet he does not understand that. He has led Australia, potentially one of the richest countries in the world, into the worst recession in 60 years&mdash;with, as I said a minute ago, a million unemployed. Government members can grin about it if they like, but there are a million unemployed and another half a million underemployed who have given up. Thirty per cent of young people in Australia are unable to find a job. Australia is a country with a now frightening level of foreign debt. There is so much misery and heartache and all Government members can do is laugh about it. Senator Collins is laughing about it now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All Mr Hawke, the Prime Minister, can offer in answer to the comprehensive policy program we have put down&mdash;a program designed to restore hope and opportunity&mdash;is to accuse us of being un-Australian. For years under Hawke, Australians have heard about the need to share the burden, the need to share the bad times and accept the falling standard of living because the good times are just ahead. He has done his deals with vested interests such as the ACTU and done deals with his rich mates&mdash;three men in a boat and all that&mdash;whilst he has said to ordinary Australians, `I am really one of you'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By saying he is an Australian, does Mr Hawke mean sharing the pain and misery that he has inflicted upon Australians; sharing the disappointment and shattered dreams&mdash;shattered dreams from record bankruptcies&mdash;that he would not understand because he has never been out there? He has never known what it is like to write a cheque to pay somebody's wages. Does Mr Hawke know what that is like? Is that what he says should be the dreams of ordinary Australians? Is that what he really offers Australia? True it might be that Paul Keating was the principal architect of this disaster, but Mr Hawke was his leader. How often over the years did we hear, `Hawke and Keating are a team. Hawke and Keating are a special team.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often that I agree with Mrs Kirner, the Premier of Victoria, but when she stuck up for Mr Kerin on Friday she was right. How could Mr Kerin be expected to communicate a message when there was no policy? Why should he be labelled a failure for telling the truth? He had the nerve to say that Australia was in its worst recession for 60 years and was condemned by his colleagues for saying so&mdash;condemned by his colleagues for being honest. Unfortunately, honesty has suffered. Honesty is a victim of the paranoia of this Government to remain in power. Why should Mr Kerin be blamed for an economic catastrophe which is primarily the result of Keating and Hawke, set in train months, if not years, ago? Mr Kerin was to be the scapegoat. He was sacrificed so that the Government could gain breathing space, yet Mr Hawke muffed it again. When Senators Ray and Richardson went to see Mr Hawke last week, they told him&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How would you know?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How do I know? I will tell Senator Ray how I know. They told him that what the Government needed was new life and new people at the top, not just a reshuffling at the top. How do we know? We know because we read it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. Senator Richardson doubted whether the Prime Minister had the courage to do it, so he gave the paper the story. What happened when it came to the crunch? Even with this public prompt, the Prime Minister was not prepared to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clearly, the advice he was given was to get rid of Gerry Hand, who was just marking time, whose factional leader, Mr Howe, stooped to one of the lowest levels of degradation in the Parliament last week&mdash;and let us see any Government member support that; and get rid of Senator Button, who has been humiliated so often. I remind the Senate that Mr Keating described Senator Button as a `do nothing Minister'; Mr Hawke ripped the industry statement off him in March, to his embarrassment; the IAC was taken away from him; and now even Austrade has been taken away from him and given to Senator Evans, of all people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, even with the public prompt, Old Jellyback could not do it because he feared that it would hasten the inevitable second challenge. The key element again was Mr Hawke's personal survival and his determination to hang on to power no matter what the cost. That was the determining factor yet again. The irony is that his failure again to take the hard decision has probably brought closer his demise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hawke praised Mr Kerin on Friday. He said he was a big man who was prepared to put the interests of the Government ahead of any individual. On the same test, Mr Hawke is a small man, because if he was prepared to put the interests of the Government against any individual he would resign. Mr Kerin can stand proud alongside Mr Hawke. The one reason Mr Hawke finds it so difficult to address the Opposition's Fightback program in rational terms is that he supports the core of the package, the GST. In 1985 he said not only that a GST was essential but also that it should have the broadest possible base&mdash;including the taxing of food&mdash;and that only he and his Government would have the courage to implement it. Courage? Not Old Jellyback. When faced with opposition from the ACTU and from a few interest groups, he buckled again and his courage wilted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost all the industrialised world now has a tax upon consumption. It recognises the need to tax consumption. From a position of economic failure&mdash;a voice from the past in the back ranks over there&mdash;Mr Hawke must now argue why we are better off not going down the path he knew was right. It is not an easy task, but it is no justification for him attacking our patriotism or that of the millions of Australians who support us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Opposition's desire to give Australians a new opportunity, a new basis for optimism and hope for the future. That is what has led us to put this policy package before the Australian people. We want it debated comprehensively on rational grounds. This package provides a program that takes responsibility from government and gives it back to individuals. It is a program that is designed to provide two million new jobs before the turn of the century. Is it un-Australian to provide jobs for two million unemployed Australians?  It is a program that reorders tax with at least some of the burden being switched from production to consumption in order to increase incentive. Is that un-Australian?  It is a program designed and independently assessed to give proportionately greatest benefit to the lower and middle income groups. Is it un-Australian to target those particular groups which have suffered so much under Mr Hawke? It is a program that is designed to encourage savings as opposed to expenditure to build the capital base of this nation and give individuals some chance to plan for their future. Is that being un-Australian? It is a program which is unashamedly pro-family, and I refer to those who will have their family allowances doubled as just one example. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Burns objects to that, does he? It is a program which encourages change through incentive and encouragement rather than directed outcomes, which is the way of this Government. It is a program which provides an enormous boost to business to enable it to grow, employ and produce the wealth that is essential for government to meet its responsibility to the poor, to the infirm and to the sick. It is a program which is designed to give world-class education to this country. Is that being un-Australian? It is a program designed to get people out of the public hospital queues and into private hospital beds. It is a program which will end the employment-sapping taxes of Labor, such as payroll tax. It is a program to end the insidious effect on individuals of bracket creep and automatic indexation of excise duties with which Hawke has ripped billions of dollars off ordinary Australians. Is this the policy package that Mr Hawke calls un-Australian?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hawke deserves to be condemned for seeking to pump up fear as a base of opposition to this package. This motion will test the Australian Democrats as well. Will they weasel out again?  Will they take the money and run as they did last week?  Is there an ounce of the legacy of the principle of Chipp still left in the Democrats? If they stand for anything, they will support this censure motion today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hawke has often said that he has enormous faith in the good sense of ordinary Australians. He should apologise to Australians for the insult he does them in seeking to debase this debate in terms of what is more or less patriotic, then apologise for all the misery and suffering he has caused, and then resign and put his record against our Fightback program to the test. He should put it before the ordinary commonsense of the Australian people. But he will not because he lacks the courage. I commend this motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I will let you into a little secret as to what one of Senator Hill's colleagues said to me the other day. One of Senator Hill's colleagues said to me that getting Senator Hill to demonstrate effective leadership in this place is like trying to push a wet noodle uphill. That is what those opposite have said about Senator Hill, and that is the sort of thing they are saying about the rest of their leadership&mdash;and that is the foundation of the motion before the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leadership that we have seen from the Opposition side has produced a policy package which is un-Australian. It is un-Australian because it is based on a series of myths about the problems with this country at the moment. It is based on a series of utterly inaccurate, unsubstantiated and unsustainable assertions about what this package will do for the economy; and it is based on a series of completely and utterly false assertions about what this package will do for ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me demonstrate what is the matter with this particular policy package. The myths it is based upon are the myth that this country is a big government country; the myth that this country is a high tax country; the myth that this is a country which is excessively dependent upon income tax; the myth that this country has an external debt which is getting out of control; the myth that competitiveness is decreasing; and the myth that living standards are falling. The whole premise of this policy package is utterly falsifiable on every one of those counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is utterly and completely falsifiable to the extent that, of the 16 OECD countries for which data exists, Australia has the second smallest government, Australia is the second lowest taxing country in the OECD and Australia is less reliant on income tax than just about any other country in the OECD. Our external debt is amply under control at the moment&mdash;well within that safety zone which the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, has himself indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian competitiveness has increased by something like 17 per cent over the last few years. Australian living standards have not fallen, with real household disposable income rising by 24 per cent and by 10 per cent in per capita terms. That is the first set of things that are wrong; that is the first set of things that are un-Australian about this particular package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More substantially and more immediately, of course, we have to deal with the claim that the gouge and screw tax strategy will do something for the Australian economy that is not being done by the Australian Government's present policy. Let me deal with what this particular tax package and the surrounding policy prescriptions will do for this country. As far as jobs are concerned, far from increasing the number of jobs, the Opposition Leader has conceded, acknowledged and accepted that employment will decrease&mdash;unemployment will increase&mdash;as a result of this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim is made that there will be about two million new jobs by the year 2000. When one examines that claim it becomes immediately apparent that, far from there being two million jobs that would not otherwise be created, the claim is being made only that there will be just over 300,000 jobs that would not otherwise be created. It is acknowledged in the Opposition's own policy package that, on the low case scenario, around 1.7 million would be jobs created anyway over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a government that has created 168,000 jobs on average each year since we came to office. All those opposite are claiming in their own policy package is that they will do better than that, over the course of a decade, by 300,000 jobs. What a pathetic little claim that is. It has nothing to do with the claim of two million; it is just not substantiated even in the Opposition's documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition claims that real wages will decrease. It spends time in the beginning of the package document deploring the way in which real wages have declined, but makes that a central element of its own policy package. It does it in a way which does not make any compensating provision, and provides nothing in the way of a safety net and nothing in the nature of a social wage to compensate for that deterioration in real wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition claims that it will increase productivity, yet its own policy package demonstrates that there will be a decrease in productivity over the course of the next decade with this package. On page 16 of its package, the Opposition identifies productivity gains over the last seven years as having been 0.9 per cent. On page 342 it states that over the next decade productivity gains will average 0.8 per cent under this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition talks about inflation. It has to acknowledge&mdash;and does acknowledge in its own policy document, at page 23 of the supplementary document&mdash;that, irrespective of the impact of this particular goods and services tax, there will be an inflationary increase running at the rate of 7.7 per cent in 1994-95. Add to that the 4.7 per cent that the Opposition has acknowledged is directly attributable to this package, and we are talking about inflation of over 12 per cent&mdash;12 per cent inflation according to the documents which the Opposition has put into the public domain. And it says that that is not un-Australian!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has not talked about interest rates, but it should talk about interest rates because interest rates simply cannot be sustained at any kind of reasonable level in that sort of inflationary environment. The Opposition has talked about, as it has to talk about, the need to maintain firm monetary policy in this sort of environment. And it will have to be firm monetary policy if, with that inflation rate, it does not want to see the whole economy spiralling totally out of control. Syntec has estimated that that interest rate increase will be running at the rate of 13 to 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, what will this package do for Australia's external debt situation? This is the most fascinating part of this particular package. This is the most fascinating concession of all. What will the Opposition's package do about the fundamental structural flaw that is alleged to exist in the Australian economy? Australia's net external debt at the moment is 35 per cent of GDP. What will Australia's external debt be at the end of the century, in the year 2000, under the Opposition's particular package? Those opposite should look at page 342 of their own document and they will see that they acknowledge that it will increase to 54 per cent. The Opposition is talking about a debt of 35 per cent of GDP becoming a massive debt, a net external debt, of 54 per cent, on its own document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators opposite look at what will happen to jobs, if they look at what will happen to real wages, if they look at what will happen to productivity, if they look at what will happen to inflation, if they look at what will happen to interest rates, if they look at what will happen to debt&mdash;if they look at every one of those things&mdash;they will find themselves showing&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then the Opposition goes on to argue that the GST package will make individuals, ordinary Australians, better off. Let us test that particular part of this package. The GST itself, the gouge and screw tax, the consumption tax, will not make anyone better off. It will create an environment where on every product, whether it is haircuts, vegetables, school clothes or school buses, every Australian will be paying 15 per cent. Okay, the wholesale sales tax goes, but a 30 per cent tax on luxuries will be eliminated so a 15 per cent tax can be applied on necessities. That is what the Opposition is doing as far as the guts of the proposal is concerned. </PARA>

Let me say something about that compensation package. In the first place, in so far as the income tax cuts themselves are concerned, they will not be fair. They are regressive income taxes, and the benefit will be manifestly less for those at the lower end of the scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a person has an income of under $20,000, what will he benefit so far as his income is concerned? He will benefit to the extent of 4.8 per cent. Under the Opposition's tax scales, that is the extent of the increase in his after tax income if he has an income of under $20,000. If a person has an income at the average weekly earnings level of around $30,000, he benefits to the extent of 6.8 per cent. But if a person has an income of $75,000, 2 1/2 times the average weekly earnings, he benefits to the extent of 14.7 per cent. That is the kind of regression that is involved. </PARA>

We do not need to adopt any of the coalition's package because our own policy strategy is much better designed to improve this country. What is the matter with this compensation package?  For a start, as I have said, the income tax side of it is hopelessly inequitable and hopelessly regressive. The only way the arithmetic begins to add up on the compensation package is with the $10 billion worth of expenditure cuts. We will hear a little more about that from Ralph Willis this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>

That will become more and more apparent as the months go by. Moreover, there is a whole heap of hidden additional imposts in the coalition's package which will make its impact on ordinary Australians devastating:  the road charges will mean an increase in registration of three times the present rate;  the inflationary impact of the health package is just not built into the Opposition's package;  the impact that all this will have on interest rates has not been built into any calculations;  and the impact it will have on State government taxes and charges has been ignored.

Nick Greiner, the Liberals' own State Premier, undermined the basics of the Opposition's claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a package that is based on a responsible fiscal policy and a responsible monetary policy; a policy that is designed to achieve and is achieving reductions in the current account deficit and with that the stabilisation of the external debt, something the Opposition has acknowledged its policy package will allow to disappear into the stratosphere. We have accompanied that policy with a substantial and far-reaching program of micro-economic reform which is designed to produce the structural flexibility that this economy needs and which will deliver results. We have put in place a safety net of labour programs, massively expensive but massively sensible programs, which are designed to ensure that the skill base is there to take advantage of the recovery which is now under way. </PARA>

Quite clearly, the strategy of the Opposition is to disrupt the processes of this Parliament as much as it possibly can between now and the time at which this Parliament is due to rise. That is what it did the other day. It knows very well that it can be supported by its rich mates who can buy it as much advertising time as it needs. It does not like the idea that advertising time during elections should be determined in a democratically fair way. That is what the Opposition does not like. That is why it attempted a filibuster in the debate the other day and that is precisely why it is continuing with a filibuster this afternoon.

There is nothing rational about leaving the welfare and the future of Australian society to an unregulated market. It simply does not work; it cannot work; it has been shown theoretically not to work and it has been shown in practice not to work. The deregulation policies which the Opposition would simply extend in its Fightback package are the reason that we have over one million people unemployed, the reason that we have a large foreign debt, the reason that we have a shift of wealth from the poor to the wealthy and the reason that we have a shift of wealth into speculation rather than productive investment. </PARA>

<PARA>That is mainly what the debate has been about until recent days when most of it has really been about leadership. There is nothing in the Opposition's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document&mdash;`Frightpack' or `Flightback' are some of the other terms that are more appropriate. Ross Gittins writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> the other day pointed out that the policies are more appropriate to the 1950s and 1960s than they are to the 1990s or to the years which we face after the turn of the century&mdash;which will redress any of the problems which we currently face. It is simply a belief in the deregulated market with certain tax changes bringing about those desirable changes in society. The market simply cannot do that without reintroducing regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that we look at the details of the package, our position is consistent in that we reject that deregulatory market driven approach.

Those opposite, like many economists, say that they will come out with environmental packages later on, indicating that they are not an essential part of their economic program. This has led them to fall into the trap of intending to reduce the price of petrol, thereby increasing the consumption of that fuel. At the same time, the Opposition's other programs undoubtedly will increase the cost of fares through the GST for people who use public transport. Undoubtedly, its cutback in government expenditure in other areas will lead to many disadvantaged people having to use private transport. This would of course increase air pollution in cities, which is a major problem in this country and adds very considerably to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>

If anything is un-Australian, it is that. For any government to be concerned with its own internal fighting, feuding, bickering and division, with the bottom line being who is going to be the Prime Minister, is more un-Australian than anything that I can think of.

Those figures are one of the leading indicators of the future course of the Australian economy. Those job ad figures have today confirmed what we on this side of the chamber know&mdash;and what I think all Australians, other than the bunch opposite who claim to run the country, know&mdash;that this country is in such deep crisis that the prospect for jobs and future employment is not improving and has not bottomed; it is getting progressively worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Restore economic growth', the former Treasurer said. What has he done? The Government has produced five successive quarters of negative growth, largely due to the policies which the heir apparent to the throne, Paul Keating, put in place. As a member of the Government, Paul Keating was the principal architect and implementer of those policies. There have been seven successive quarters of negative growth out of the last eight. We have seen a collapse in investment in eight quarters out of the last nine. What has that done to economic growth? That has put economic growth at its lowest level for 60 years&mdash;because it is not growth; it is negative. The economy is shrinking day by day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that the Government has reduced the rate of inflation, but how has it achieved that? It has reduced the rate of inflation by bludgeoning the Australian economy into submission, by giving Australia 1 1/2 million unemployed and under-employed persons.

That is the most cruel, monstrous lie that has ever been perpetrated on the Australian electorate. Last Friday, the Prime Minister shot the messenger, Mr Kerin; he did not have the guts to have a go at shooting the person who wrote the messages, namely, himself.

We need not have a situation where one in three of our young people are out of work, with little prospect in the foreseeable future of getting a job, and with the prospect of the number of unemployed rising inexorably.

Ninety-five per cent of all taxpayers will face a marginal rate of tax of 30c or less. The targeting of income tax reductions has been geared and directed towards lower and middle income earners&mdash;those whose earnings are in the range of $20,000 to $50,000, those whom this Government has crippled through progressive income tax increases, in effective terms, over the last eight years. </PARA>

Those opposite did not have the guts to introduce it. </PARA>

At the end of day one, the Prime Minister, without even consulting Treasurer Keating, pulled the rug out from under the whole deal. He announced in a press conference, `Bill Kelty says that we cannot have a goods and services tax, so it is off the agenda'. That is why we did not have a goods and services tax in Australia five or six years ago, and those opposite know that as well as I do. Those opposite know it as well as all Australians do. </PARA>

It is a tax that is regressive. It is a tax that benefits the wealthy, hurts the poor and damages the middle class in this country. That is the sort of tax it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me go to the figures. Let me demonstrate my proposition. Let me do something that has never been done on this side of the argument before: prove a point. People earning $20,000 a year would gain 4.8 per cent in income from this tax. At the level of $30,000&mdash;around the level of average weekly earnings&mdash;the gain would be 6.8 per cent. But at $50,000&mdash;for those in a higher income bracket&mdash;the gain would be 12.4 per cent. Comparing $30,000 with $50,000&mdash;these are percentages, not just flat money amounts&mdash;the increases go from 6.8 per cent to 12.4 per cent. If one is in that group of Australians&mdash;less than 2 per cent overall&mdash;who earn more than $75,000 a year, which is two and a half times the weekly average earnings, the gain peaks at 14.7 per cent. A low income earner on $20,000 would get a 4.8 per cent tax cut but someone earning more than $75,000 would get 14.7 per cent, and 14.7 per cent of $75,000 is worth a damned sight more than 4.8 per cent of $20,000. And the Opposition says this tax is not inequitable!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tax that provably serves the rich and wealthy in this country, looks after the Liberal Party and National Party mates, does not help low income earners, penalises the middle classes in this country and is totally regressive. On top of that, this whole consumption tax package is a package that reduces real wages. At the same time that taxes would go up, wages would come down under this package. That is not the wages of the executives or the wages of the captains of Australian industry&mdash;there is no plan here to curb excessive executive salaries; none whatsoever&mdash;but the wages of ordinary working Australians, and they would come down quite dramatically. This package is deceitful. Up front it says that real wages have fallen in Australia but, in its fine print, it forces a scenario on this country that would push real wages down further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a high inflation package. At the moment inflation in Australia is running at 3.3 per cent. On Budget forecasts that will drop to 3 per cent. What does this package do?  According to the reputable and independent economic research unit, Syntec, this package will push up inflation from 3.3 per cent, targeted at 3 per cent, to 9.5 per cent. As it does that, interest rates will rise&mdash;Syntec testifies to that in its own independent analysis&mdash;and the exchange rate will firm, meaning that for exporters of rural products and mineral commodities out of this country the prices will get higher, the returns will be fewer and we will suffer as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three basic myths that the Opposition has tried to peddle about this package. I will deal with each of these myths and expose the paucity of reasoning and the deceitful nature of the allegation. The first myth is that living standards in Australia have fallen. Since 1983, real household disposable income per capita has risen by over 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second myth is that our international competitiveness is deteriorating. Under Hewson, foreign debt would increase by over 50 per cent of GDP compared to around 30 per cent now. An increase to 50 per cent from 30 per cent would be a direct by-product of the Hewson package&mdash;a direct causal link established&mdash;and the Opposition cannot get out of that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third myth is that Australia has a relatively big government and high taxes. Of course, everyone knows that that is not true, yet the Opposition propounds that theory. Australia is the second lowest taxing country in the OECD with only Turkey being lower. The wholesale sales tax is not distortionary&mdash;it comprises less than 2 per cent of business costs and less than 1 1/4 per cent of our exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are examples of deceit. I use the word `deceit', and there is no single greater deceit in this package than the deceit about industrial relations, wages and working conditions in this country. It has been said by Dr Hewson and Mr Howard that the centrepiece of this whole package is industrial relations reform, as they call it. That is what they say. That is the centrepiece. In over 700 pages of written material, there is one-plus page on what they mean by industrial relations. All they say in that one-plus page in more than 700 is that they will rip the guts out of the Department of Industrial Relations and destroy its program estimates. That is all they say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there a clue as to what they will do?  No, there is not. Is there a clear policy statement on so-called reform? No, there is not. Is there a series of press statements by Mr Howard?  Yes, there is, but he never gets pinned down, he always evades the point and he never comes clean. What we do know from Mr Howard is that the New Zealand road beckons him. The New Zealand road is the road he wants to travel. The New Zealand road is the road which scorched the earth in New Zealand, drove that economy into the ground, created unemployment of the sort that we have not seen in this country since the Great Depression and totally destroyed the living standards of New Zealanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, therefore, that the industrial relations policy&mdash;the so-called centrepiece&mdash;is the mystical ambush that we expect to get near to an election. Why do not honourable senators opposite ever tell the truth?  If it is the centrepiece, tell us what the policy is rather than us having to divine it from a series of press releases, leaks and, shall I say, Delphic views put by their shadow spokesman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do know a couple of things, and on those couple of things we should concentrate. We do know, for example, that it is the intention of the Opposition to destroy the Industrial Relations Commission. We do know that it is the intention of the Opposition to undermine the award system in Australia that protects minimum wage and condition entitlements for ordinary Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do know, courtesy of page 2 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last Thursday, that it is Dr Hewson's clear intention, to use his own words, `to destroy the Australian union movement'. He argues that for his package to be realisable the Australian union movement `must be and shall be destroyed'. This is one of those transitional difficulties to which he refers&mdash;the fact that an organisation to which 42 per cent of the Australian work force belong will be ignored. In any democratic society the checks and balances that hold fair play in place require a free, open and democratic trade union movement. But, no. None of these issues are issues with which Dr Hewson is concerned. I ask honourable senators to see for themselves, if they have not already done so, page 2 of last Thursday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. Dr Hewson's commitment is to destroy the union movement, and that is a transitional change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard from Mr Greiner. He had to leave Australia and go to Japan to tell foreigners how good Australia's industrial relations were and, I might say, he did a very objective and fair job. Mr Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales, a man with a very poor industrial relations record in his own State&mdash;disputes in New South Wales run, at 51 per cent, above the average for the rest of the country&mdash;described Australian industrial relations in these terms:</PARA>

<PARA>Thank you, Mr Greiner, for that unsolicited testimonial about success and achievement in the field of industrial relations by this Government. Is not that a basis for continuing economic improvement?  Of course it is. Is not this an example of getting Australians to work together to remove the old barriers of them and us, employer and employee, and worker and boss?  Is not this a basis for setting team goals for an enterprise, aiming at achievement of those goals and then trying to improve by sharing the benefits in profits and better wages?  Of course it is. This is the basis that we have created in this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Dr Hewson want to do? He wants to destroy it and break it down. He wants to renew the confrontation of the Fraser years and replace cooperation with conflict. He wants to pit Australian against Australian; he wants to divide Australians into boss and worker, employer and employee. That is what he wants to do. That is the commitment he makes in his policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen no better an example than in the so-called Austrain package, whereby if a person is working in a company he or she can be easily sacked and replaced by someone receiving 80 per cent of the award rate. That is what Dr Hewson's package proposes&mdash;80 per cent of the award rate. He will say, `You are all out, sacked and finished; we will replace you with people earning 80 per cent of your wage'. When those people finish and, 12 months later, their replacements go up to the full rate, they will be sacked and replaced. The Opposition is promising recyclable unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am running out of time and I have not had the opportunity to turn to the issue of health. Through the accord, this Government introduced Medicare and removed health costs from the Australian household budget. The Hewson consumption tax package, apart from adding 15 per cent costs and lowering wages, will add to costs in the Australian household $2 billion extra per year in health costs. Who will meet the extra $2 billion? It will be ordinary Australians. It will be a cost which they do not have to pay now: a $2 billion levy. Is that costed into the so-called compensation? Of course it is not, because the Fightback program is basically a deceitful package. The document goes for over 700 pages all up. It tries to hide the nasties somewhere in the fine print, while beckoning up front and saying, `This is a good package for you'. It is deceitful. It will be unmasked, it will be seen for what it is and it will be defeated. </PARA>

I remind you, Mr Deputy President, that earlier this year the Australian Institute of Family Studies reported that 24 per cent of families where the wife was not in the work force were having difficulty financially, and another 49 per cent were just coping.

But the Government will not debate the Fightback package. We will get an emotional diatribe like we have just had from Senator Cook.

Neither of the men who engineered this recession&mdash;the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)&mdash;regardless of which job they have currently or will have in the future, will have the gall to pick up the remedies for the recession that they caused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is true; it cannot be debated. The Opposition is not serious. In Budget considerations this year&mdash;only three or four months ago&mdash;the Government decided to introduce 12 per cent superannuation for every Australian worker by the end of the decade. There has not been a more visionary announcement by a government in this country in 40 years. It is a great announcement and a great decision, and one that is long overdue. What happened on the Opposition benches?  If those opposite have any concern about savings, it was not expressed in relation to the Budget in August. All we heard then was Mr Howard&mdash;we all remember him, he used to be an Opposition Leader&mdash;claiming that it was an expropriation of employers' profits. Those opposite did not even have the wit, the capacity, to recognise that Australia could do nothing less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand where this concern for savings came from when there is no question that during the next 30 years the number of pensioners, as against the number of taxpayers, will become a huge problem for us. At the moment for every six taxpayers, we have one pensioner. By the year 2030, the number of taxpayers for every one pensioner drops to three&mdash;the number for taxpayers halves. We have a choice, and I suppose this is what the Opposition has been looking at. We can halve the pension, and I assume that the Opposition accepts that because it rejects the alternative. There is only one alternative:  to introduce decent superannuation provisions for all Australians to provide for their later lives. The nation cannot afford it with the ageing of the population. Apparently, that is completely missed in this so-called package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day those opposite are prepared to say that pensioners can have their earnings halved, have their meagre incomes cut to shreds, because they do not want to expropriate&mdash;as they put it&mdash;employers' profits. Let us look at this so-called expropriation of employers' profits. If we went to any of the capital cities in Europe&mdash;or the United States&mdash;and asked an employer just how radical, how unusual, how different, how extraordinary is it to expect employers to contribute to employees' superannuation funds, it would not be unusual to find that it is the norm right across Europe. In all the countries that Australia likes to compare itself with, this is considered normal&mdash;nothing unusual;  just the normal, everyday, routine occurrence. No matter where we go or who we ask in Europe, no-one disagrees with what is a matter of routine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite, jumping as always to the tune of the employer organisations, terrified that the big boys with the big quids might suddenly turn against them, just say, `Whatever you want. If you want us to consign Australian pensioners to misery, if you want us to tell them that you want to halve their income, we will do so because you have asked us'. That is what this package provides for Australia's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even worse is that those opposite have had the gall to complain about foreign debt. The only way to get a savings pool of hundreds of billions is via the announcement in August. That is the only way. But this lot opposite were just not prepared to do that, could not accept the last hurdle; they had to turn back and run away. This Government will not be doing that. We will not be prepared to accept the halving of pensioner incomes because of some sacred agenda for a tax that hits the poor but benefits the rich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at any package, whether it is this consumption tax package or any other, I think all Australians have to ask themselves some questions about our future. It seems to me that Australia's future obviously lies in moving away from agriculture and raw mineral exports and getting into some value adding and into manufacturing. The real question for Australians is twofold: first, how do we achieve that;  and secondly, who can implement that program? The answer to the first lies in the creation of a climate where investment can flourish, a climate which would have as its first requirement low inflation and low interest rates. If we do not have those two, we cannot have investment or jobs. So what happens?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are presented with a package which gets rid of both, which destroys any hope, which dashes all hope of low inflation and low interest rates. Later during the week the Treasurer will have something to say about just what that inflation figure ought to be. Just as today he punched a hole in the costings of this consumption tax package, during the week he will do the rest of the job. He will show that it is not just a matter of grossly, fraudulently, underestimating the savings nominated in the package; it is also a case of underestimating the inflationary effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every Australian, even every pensioner, who has any dollars in the bank will have to understand that this package brings about an automatic, immediate, overnight reduction in all that person has saved through his or her life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are looking at the climate that needs to be created for investment, we need to look at some sort of program for micro-economic reform. I can recall my colleague Senator Ray pointing out just how much the Opposition has been prepared to forget the Fraser years. It is worth reminding those opposite that in those Fraser years not one step on the road to micro-economic reform was ever taken. During this Government's period of office, we have already had a huge overhaul of the telecommunications industry. The consortium Optus, which was successful only a couple of weeks ago, has already committed itself to a $4 billion investment in Australia over the next five years, and 5,000 direct jobs are to be created. We will see an additional 26,000 direct and indirect jobs over the next 20 years from the third runway, which we approved in 1989. Demand at Australia's premier airport will be met and will be met for the next couple of decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, airline deregulation has only been in place for a very short time, but already, with the new entrant, Compass, in the field, we have seen fare discounts of extraordinary proportions. This has not been heard of in Australia for decades. We have seen a 38 per cent increase in passenger numbers over one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, I refer to waterfront reform. I have noticed over the last few weeks that the Opposition has not been asking Senator Collins any questions about it. I can understand why when we look at the figures. Enterprise agreements covering facilities in all capital cities and a number of regional ports have already been approved by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority over the last few months. So far, 2,362 waterfront employees have left the industry under the Government's reform program. That is 500 more than the announced two-year target of 1,800 redundancies to be achieved by this November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of those areas there have been tremendous advances through economic reform. In the area of trade, exports of manufactured goods have increased by 112 per cent in real terms since 1983-84. The opportunity for the change away from reliance on commodities is already there and we are delivering the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look over the Tasman to New Zealand to get an idea of what the Opposition really has in store for Australia. The New Zealand Government, with all the so-called benefits of its consumption tax, has cut the standard rates of unemployment benefits and sickness benefits by 9.7 per cent and 16.6 per cent respectively. This year there will be no indexation of benefits rates. The family benefit as a universal payment has been abolished. Honourable senators should remember that it is to New Zealand that Dr Hewson went to get his inspiration. The young are specifically targeted. The unemployed in the 20-24 age group in New Zealand have had their income slashed by 24.7 per cent this year. More than one million adults&mdash;one-third of the population&mdash;are badly affected, directly or indirectly, by the New Zealand consumption tax. </PARA>

It ranks with the child endowment introduced by Mr Lang in the 1930s. This is one of the great reforms of the century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In setting and reaching benchmarks, the supplement ensured that working class families in this country had available to them cash that they had never thought of before. The only problem in the early years of the scheme was getting it out to families. But hundreds of thousands of families now benefit from what has been a tremendous reform specifically directed to low income people and their children. Nowhere in the Opposition's package can any low income person in this nation find comfort. For example, in the much trumpeted tax cuts that is not even on the agenda. If one has a quid in this country one will get a much bigger cut out of the Opposition and this package but, if one has not, the battle continues and it gets harder and harder. </PARA>

The public is sick and tired&mdash;actually, sick to death&mdash;of the public brawling within the Government which is diverting its attention from concentrating on the real issues and overcoming the ills that many people in our society suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These ills are visited upon them by a combination of factors but the Government appears not to be concentrating on the solutions. The problems are manifest and widespread. One tragedy facing this country is 30 per cent youth unemployment. Also, 100,000 low income earners in Australia are spending half their incomes just keeping a roof over their heads. In the past 10 years the net tax payable by a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children has gone up 40 per cent more than the increase in disposable income. Family allowances are now only two-thirds the value they were when introduced in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is upon the family that the burden of this Government's economic policies falls far too heavily. As mentioned by Senator Richardson, the Minister for Social Security, the Government has introduced the family allowance supplement, but that family allowance supplement goes to about only 8 per cent of all families. Most families, including some of those on FAS, are far worse off now than they were in 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do I say 1976? What has happened to family allowance assistance since 1976 has to be repeated time and time again. As the Senate will recall, in 1976 the tax rebate for children was abolished and the money saved was transferred into a family allowance. In other words, it was a payment out of the hip-pocket of the taxpayer into the purse of the mother. It did not cost the Government a cent. It was the family's money and the Government took it out of the back pocket and put it into the purse. I supported that but at the time I warned that, if the family allowance was not indexed from that moment onwards, there would be a travesty of justice visited upon all families in Australia. That is precisely what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, successive governments have purloined from the purses of mothers something like $8 billion. Each fortnight this Government takes $49.60 out of the purse of every mother in a family with four children; that is, to the tune of almost $50 a fortnight this Government is putting its hand into the purse and taking out that money. No wonder families feel that there is something amiss. There is 50 bucks amiss for a start, and then we add to that the problems of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has boasted that these days families can have two and three jobs. It boasts about the number of jobs that have been created. But let us look at what these jobs are; let us see whether they are full time or part time jobs. Here is the Government boasting that families are now able to have two and three jobs but, of course, the family needs two or three jobs just to make ends meet. Let it not be forgotten, either by the Government or by the Opposition, that, so far as those families which rely on one income and particularly a lower income are concerned, the weighted average minimum award rate of pay for full time adult employees has fallen in real money terms by about $60 per week in six years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is a disastrous situation in the community. I have urged the Government to look at the participation rates in the work force and see who for perhaps more socially desirable reasons wants to stay in the paid work force and who wants to come out of the paid work force. It is not a question of compulsion or otherwise; it is a question of giving people free choice. Many people do not have that freedom of choice because they are forced, by economic pressures, to enter the paid work force. I am talking about those hundreds of thousands of mothers who would prefer to do the job which they consider is the most important in the world for them, that is, the nurturing of their children, yet they are forced into the paid work force just to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have a new unemployment figure out this week. Is it going to be another disaster? I fear that it is, with unemployment at between 800,000 to 900,000. That is a disgrace. The attention of the Government is being diverted from its real mission, because it seems to see the demolition of the Fightback package as its mission. That is not the Government's real mission; its real mission is to get on with the government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate the Opposition for its political strategy because, sitting where I do, day by day I can see the Government falling for it.

Clearly, there is a philosophical backdrop to the Opposition's Fightback package. It capitalises on the fears and very real concerns that are widespread within the community. It appeals to those who rightly believe that human initiative has been stifled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some areas the Fightback package has a somewhat warped view of the principle of near democracy. Near democracy is a principle&mdash;an ideal&mdash;which is very dear to the hearts of Australians, who love to be known as wanting a fair go and who love to be seen to be having a say. I am talking about the principle of subsidiarity. People want to have closer control over those who exercise power over them. I agree that the principle of subsidiarity is an important principle in government&mdash;that power should reside with the smallest group capable of efficiently performing the functions for which that power is required. In that way, those over whom the power is exercised have closer, nearer and more effective control over those who exercise the power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a good thing, but I believe that that principle is warped in some parts of the Fightback package. In my view, the Fightback package places far more confidence in market forces overcoming economic and social ills than is warranted from experience in a number of other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is all at sea. It reminds me of a story that was going around last week. The ship of government was at sea and a report was made to Captain Kerin during the night. He was told, `There is a light&mdash;a vessel &mdash;ahead, and we are heading on collision course'. Captain Kerin got on the two-way radio and said, `This is Captain Kerin. You are heading towards us on collision course. I order you to change course'. The reply came back, `This is Able Seaman Smith. No, you change course'. Captain Kerin got Admiral Hawke up and Admiral Hawke said, `This is Admiral Hawke. I order you&mdash;indeed, instruct you&mdash;to change course. We are on collision course'. The reply was, `This is Able Seaman Smith. No, you change course'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Captain Kerin and Admiral Hawke huddled together and said, `What will we do? We will appeal to his good nature'. Admiral Hawke said, `This is Admiral Hawke. Will you please change course; I am a battleship'. The reply was, `This is Able Seaman Smith. No, will you please change course; this is a lighthouse'. The Government is at sea; it is not heeding the warnings that have been given to it&mdash;the clear light that has been shown to it. I believe that the Government should concentrate on avoiding those rocky outcrops and go full steam ahead to overcome the ills that are besetting this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that good government is not being exercised and there is not the imaginative leadership which would give a lead to the community and encompass the aspirations of the ordinary people. For good government there needs to be values as well as organisation. Within the community there must be a cohesive set of values, a clearly understood set of values, by any good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, good government means the establishment of an economic and social order in which persons can live with freedom and dignity and pursue both their spiritual development and material well-being in conditions of equal opportunity and economic security. I believe that the Government fails that test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the Government's attention is being diverted from getting back to basic principles by its attempts to follow the rules that are being set by the Opposition in its Fightback package. The Government should go back to basics. It should look at the beacons. There are plenty of beacons in the past which are clearly there for Labor to see, but because Labor is so blinkered it cannot see them. If the Government took the high ground and argued the matters from first principles, it may well be that we would see a very important debate in this community&mdash;not about the minutiae of some parts of the package, but an overall debate about where good government should lead this country and about whether the aspirations of the community are, in fact, captured and enunciated by the Government or by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that I could support this censure motion. The first part of the motion states:</PARA>

<PARA>This is the other thing that concerns me. We appear to be debating things as though there will be an election next week. As I understand it, there will not be an election until 1993 yet, listening to members of the House of Representatives, one would imagine that there will be an election next week. This censure motion, even were it passed, would not affect the course of this Government. Clearly, if this censure motion were passed in the House of Representatives, we would have an election next week or within the foreseeable future. At this point, it is not my intention to vote either for or against this motion. The Government has moved an amendment to it which has just landed on my desk, and about which Senator Graham Richardson made some comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, what I have said is very clear&mdash;people can take it the way they want to. I believe that there are many hundreds of thousands who are hurting in the community. In that sense, I think the Opposition in this chamber today has done a service to the community, but I believe that this motion is more appropriate for the House of Representatives than the Senate. I understand that the House of Representatives is not sitting now, of course. We should hold our fire. We in this place should be regarded with some degree of respect for our ability to be a check on the House of Representatives, which is the place of government. We should do that judiciously in every way we can, as we attempted to do last week. I appeal to the Government to look at the signs, to see the problems and to heed the warnings, because if it does not it will be sunk, together with its leadership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said some time ago, we have taken this unusual step because Australia is in crisis. We have asked for the Government to recognise that crisis and to recognise the misery and heartache that have been caused to so many Australians&mdash;the million unemployed, the other half million who are underemployed or who have given up, and the 30 per cent of the youth of this country who cannot find jobs. The Government should, first, recognise these tragic issues. Secondly, in recognising them, it should face up to the cause: the Government's own economic incompetence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, instead of sacking the previous Treasurer because he failed to adequately communicate, should address its policies and address where it has gone wrong. It should get away from the argument that was put in the shallow job statement a few weeks ago in this place that the Budget and the Government strategy are on track. They cannot be on track when every few weeks the unemployment figures are higher. We suspect that later this week the figures will be higher again. The Government cannot be on track. It needs to change policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has put down a comprehensive and integrated package, as has been said today, of nearly 700 pages, to provide for this country a new direction that can give hope to Australians, that can give job opportunities and that can restore people's confidence in themselves. We have put that package on the table for debate. We want to debate it. We want it debated from now until the next election. But we want a rational debate, not a debate based on fear. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) should understand that. Like any Prime Minister, he should be willing to take the debate on principle, to attempt to take the economic argument, and to let the Australian people, in the end, make their choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have raised this issue today because the Government has failed to recognise the misery and heartache that have been caused to hundreds of thousands of Australians as a result of its economic incompetence and because it has failed to offer Australians any alternative to the Fightback package that we have put before the Australian people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not agree with that. We do have substantive policies, as is well known. We are very proud of those policies because they have delivered effective micro-economic reform to the Australian community and have developed a very effective set of longer term economic settings which will be crucial to this country's long term economic future. We have policy settings in place that have beaten inflation and brought it down to levels that are unquestionably in line with our major trading partners. We have policies in place that have created a situation where interest rates are now at manageable levels&mdash;9.5 percentage points&mdash;compared with what they were 18 months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have policies where wages growth has been kept in check by the accord. We have a fiscal policy which is delivering structural integrity so far as the Budget is concerned. We have a policy in place which has reduced the current account deficit and which is stabilising the external debt in association with that. We have policies in place which are keeping demand growth below production growth, ensuring that inflation will be locked in at its present low levels and ensuring that the current account deficit reduction will be locked in at its low levels. We have an industry policy in place which is delivering genuine structural change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a micro-economic strategy over a whole variety of sectors which is ensuring competitiveness and flexibility and productivity gains in the Australian economy. At the same time, we do have a policy strategy in place which is operating as an effective safety net, both in the social welfare area generally and so far as labour programs are concerned. These policies are delivering skills and training to people who will need them as the economy picks up. We are delivering all of that in an environment where, although there has been recession, as we are all acutely aware, the economy&mdash;at least so far as the non-farm economy is concerned&mdash;is unquestionably emerging from recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence is there, with a 0.4 per cent net increase in the September quarter national account so far as the non-farm product is concerned. The evidence is there, with demand recovering in the September quarter, with profits and investment in equipment rising, with private final consumption expenditure remaining strong, with exports remaining strong and net exports in particular contributing 3.1 percentage points of real growth. We have a situation where, as a result of that, there has been more than a 20 per cent improvement in the current account deficit, despite a strong deterioration in the terms of trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have positive signs continuing with dwelling approvals trending upwards and housing starts being set to rise strongly throughout the course of 1991-92. We have a number of business surveys indicating that although orders are currently at a low level, business activity is beginning to pick up. So we do have policies in place. We do have a strategy for the longer term sustainable growth in employment and in the economy, which is utterly at odds with the piecemeal scramble for the affections of the electorate that the Opposition has been demonstrating with its particular package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast, as we saw during the censure debate, is immense. The kind of strategy the Opposition is talking about&mdash;its alternative strategy&mdash;is one that will produce job reductions in the short run and not guarantee anything like the longer term job creation it is talking about. We are talking about a strategy which will deliver inflation, on the Opposition's own documentation, at over 12 per cent. We are talking about interest rates which, on its own documentation, will increase, and which all objective observers are saying will be of the order of 13 to 16 per cent. If that follows through into mortgage rates, just a two percentage point increase in mortgage rates will completely destroy the benefit for the average household of the tax cuts which the Opposition is talking about for such a household. It is committed to reducing real wages significantly and, by its own admission, it has destined productivity to go backwards. It does not have a package; it has a slipshod, piecemeal collection of bright ideas by yuppie undergraduates who do not know what they are doing, put in place by a leadership that does not know what it is doing, except capitulating to its perceived political needs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs been drawn to the public lecture by Mr Justice Kirby calling for a review of Australia's drug laws? Mr Justice Kirby stated that Australian drug laws and policies had developed more as a response to international pressure than as a well targeted response to the dimension and character of the real problems of drug abuse in this country. He further suggests that the drug problem is more fitting for the attention of public health authorities than a court of law. Does the Minister agree with calls for a change to the way in which Australian authorities handle the drug problem in this country? Has the Minister examined the comments of Mr Justice Kirby? If so, what action is planned on these proposals? Further, are there any plans to change the Government's policy on drugs from prohibition to health care or alternative regulatory policies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen press reports of a speech given by Mr Justice Kirby in which he spoke of what he claimed to be `Australia's fixation on prohibition to solve its drug problems'. He went on to detail that he thought that was imposing too high a cost on the community in regard to its police, court resources, and so on. That is a very unfair characterisation of Australia's strategy to deal with the problem of drug addiction in our society, whether we are speaking about the drugs that are labelled illegal or the drugs, alcohol and tobacco which cause such devastation to the health of so many people in our community. In fact, it is quite untrue to say that any one policy is dominant, whether it be prohibition of the illegal drugs, public health programs, or education rehabilitation programs. There is a partnership between all these areas which places us in a unique position in dealing with the problem of a drug-ridden Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Drug Offensive was a co-sponsor of this Cup.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We got the message across to those 2,000 very fit, young Australians not only that their sport should be drug free&mdash;and they are committed to that&mdash;but also that they, as peer group members, should be putting pressure on their own age group, the higher teenage group, to take issue with the phenomenon of binge drinking. Unfortunately, binge drinking is a very important part of the culture in Australia, particularly at the end of the school year. Binge drinking by young people is a very serious and important part of the aberrant drug behaviour in which they can indulge. This, of course, can lead to violence which has its own problems in our society.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian society does not set an impossible goal of ridding society of drugs, or of requiring drug abuse to be totally eliminated from our society, but we believe that the harm created by drug taking in our society can be minimised. On the law enforcement side, that requires vigorous action, in my belief, to stop trafficking in drugs. To that end, this chamber has been particularly supportive of measures to increase funding for the Australian Federal Police and the Customs services to prevent the importing of certain drugs into Australia and, of course, to confiscate the profits of crime of those who do engage in that drug trafficking, making profits out of our vulnerable, young Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not mean that. The recession is continuing as far as the aggregate figures are concerned. The overall GDP result in the September national accounts quarter is disappointing, but it is important to realise that gross non-farm product rose by 0.4 per cent. Obviously, that was not enough to ensure an overall net positive result in an environment where, in the farm sector, there was a full 16 per cent reduction in output as a result of the massive problems that that sector is experiencing from a combination of lost production through drought, and low prices as a result of overseas development. It is a phenomenally difficult environment to be coping with, as far as that particular sector is concerned.

Senator Boswell&mdash;as Senator Ray said, not trusted to occupy any position other than No. 2 on the obituary speakers' list&mdash;at the time of the last Budget was not heard to say anything about what the situation might be in the farm sector. Certainly we have not heard anything from Mr Fischer, who constantly has to be hidden from exposure because of his blundering around in this particular policy area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has he seen last week's `Corporate Brief' from the respected and long established economic consultancy, Syntec? Does it argue that the Hewson consumption tax package would result in higher interest rates, higher inflation rates and a higher exchange rate because of the Opposition policy on wages and industrial relations?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have actually read the Syntec report, `Corporate Brief', dated 2 December 1991. It is not fair to describe Syntec as a pro-Government agency&mdash;it is not. It is a genuinely independent and, I believe, respected economic consultancy aimed at making economic forecasts for the benefit of the business community. Syntec did forecast that the consumption tax package of Dr Hewson would increase inflation and interest rates in Australia, and would increase the exchange rate. Perhaps the best thing to do is to quote exactly what was said. The introductory paragraph states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you think Hewson will win the election in 1993, prepare for a roller-coaster ride in interest rates&mdash;and, to a lesser extent, the exchange rate. A weakening international economy will bring 1992 interest rate falls. From a Hewson victory in 1993, rises must be expected as the new Government beds down a radical new labour market policy in a hostile union setting. The interest upswing must then re-commence as GST-adjusted  inflation reaches a minimum of 9 1/2% in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the key elements of the Budget this year for the Government was to lock in a low inflation rate. It is a key element of our wages policy. The inflation rate is now at 3.3 per cent. According to the Syntec forecast, the Hewson inflation rate would be 9.5 per cent&mdash;a jump in inflation of 6.2 per cent during that period. That is a 6.2 per cent turbo-charged inflation rate to 9.5 per cent.</PARA>

That is what Syntec said. As I have said, Syntec is an independent body. This is not the Government, this is an independent economic forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does Syntec say that inflation will blow out so dramatically?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have indicated on several previous occasions, Australia has consistently called for the establishment of a universal and non-discriminatory register of conventional arms transfers under the auspices of the UN. I am pleased to inform the Senate that a resolution which establishes such a register was adopted in the First Committee of the United Nations on 15 November. Australia was a co-sponsor of that resolution, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority of 106 to one, with eight abstentions and only Cuba voting against. The eight countries abstaining were Burma, China, DPRK, Iraq, Oman, Pakistan, Singapore and Sudan. This resolution reflects the clear view of the world community that there is a need for greater transparency and, consequently, greater restraint with respect to arms transfers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution calls for member states to exercise due restraint in exports and imports of conventional arms; the establishment of a register to include data on international arms transfers; and the establishment of two groups of technical experts, one to report to next year's General Assembly on the procedures and input requirements of the register and one to be established in 1994 to prepare a report on the continuing operation of the register and its further developments, taking into account the interim work of the Conference on Disarmament. In this context, the resolution also requests the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, of which Australia is one of 39 members, to address as soon as possible the question of excessive and destabilising accumulation of arms, including military holdings and procurement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does intend to contribute to and participate in this ongoing process, which, if implemented, will certainly assist in minimising the possibilities of excessive and destabilising arms transfers. This is not to suggest that arms should not be transferred to meet legitimate self-defence requirements, a point that Senator Robert Ray and I have often made. In terms of future action, Australia will, of course, contribute to the register. We will work actively in the Conference on Disarmament in support of its consideration of this issue, and we will make available Foreign Affairs and Defence personnel to participate, as appropriate, in the two expert studies.</PARA>

That is exactly how this package will come to be regarded by the Australian people when they come to appreciate just what a mess it is; when they come to appreciate how the premises on which it is constructed are false; when they come to appreciate how the claims it makes about changing the bases of the Australian economy are false and, moreover, producing results which are utterly damaging to the economy; and when they come to appreciate how much damage will be done to ordinary Australians by the operation of this particular package.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Thursday, 5 December 1991 I undertook to consider matters which were raised by Senators during the proceedings on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991. The Deputy-President and Chairman of Committees, Senator Colston, also undertook to consider one of those questions. I have considered those matters and now make a statement to the Senate. This statement covers the question raised with Senator Colston, and he concurs with the statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were three major matters which were raised during the discussion on the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the ruling of the Chairman of Committees, which I upheld as being in accordance with a ruling which I made on 3 December 1991, to the effect that a contingent notice of motion to seek to overcome the limitations imposed on debate on an urgent bill may be used only once</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.my ruling that, when the Chairman of Committees has reported to the President that a ruling by the Chairman has been objected to, the President is then required to rule on the correctness of the Chairman's ruling</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the raising of points of order by Senators during the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before proceeding to discuss these matters, I should make some observations on the significance of the limitation of debate on urgent bills under standing order 142.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Limitation of Debate on Urgent Bills</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standing order 142 provides for the Senate to declare that a bill is an urgent bill, that debate on the bill should be limited, and that the Senate's decision on the bill should be taken within a limited time. When orders under this standing order have been made, the Senate has decided that a bill must be dealt with by a particular time, whether a specified time or after the expiration of a quantum of time. The standing order is expressed to operate "notwithstanding anything contained in any other standing or other order". It requires the Chair, at the expiration of the prescribed time, to bring the proceedings on the urgent bill to a conclusion by putting the questions requisite to dispose of the bill. While orders under the standing order are in operation, therefore, the Chair is under an obligation to ensure that the order of the Senate is complied with, and that the decision of the Senate is not defeated and the proceedings on the bill delayed. Any rulings by the Chair must be consistent as far as possible with the Senate's determination that the urgent bill must be dealt with within the prescribed time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that context I will now proceed to consider the matters which were raised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Contingent Notices of Motion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Hill and other Senators have on the Notice Paper 4 types of contingent notices of motion to allow them to move for the suspension of standing orders to seek to overcome the limitations imposed by the operation of standing order 142. The contingent notices provide for motions to be moved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to allow debate to take place on a declaration of urgency</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to avoid the limitation of debate on a motion for the allotment of time</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to extend the time available to consider the urgent bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to allow amendments circulated other than by the government to be put at the expiration of the time allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since these contingent notices were first employed in 1986, when a motion has been moved pursuant to a contingent notice, debate has been allowed on the motion to suspend standing orders for the time allowed for such motions, even where, under standing order 142, no debate is allowed or the time for debate has expired. This interpretation was followed on this occasion; for example, Senator Hill was allowed to move a suspension motion pursuant to a contingent notice when the time for proceedings on the bill had expired, and debate was allowed on that motion. This interpretation is very liberal as regards the rights of Senators. It would be open to the Chair to adopt an alternative and stricter interpretation, namely, that when the time for debate has expired no further motions may be moved and no further debate may take place, and the question before the Chair must be put forthwith. The interpretation which has been followed is in accordance with the traditional liberality of the Senate and represents a significant right on the part of individual Senators to seek to have the Senate change its mind and allow more time for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaving aside the question of whether such a motion should be allowed to be moved, and regardless of whether debate should be allowed on such a motion, it is clear that the Chair can allow only one such motion to be moved at the stage of the proceedings referred to in the notice. If this were not so, Senators could, by moving successive motions to suspend standing orders, defeat the limitation of time and frustrate the order of the Senate that a bill must be dealt with. The Chair could not allow such a procedure to defeat the express determination of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ruling which I made on 3 December 1991 may be summarised as follows. Senator Hill had a contingent notice of motion to move suspension of standing orders to remove the time limit on debate on the motion for the allotment of time. It had been assumed in the past that the time allowed for debate on the suspension motion would not be part of the time allowed for debate on the motion for the allotment of time. That assumption had been followed on this occasion. This raised the possibility, however, of an endless series of motions for the suspension of standing orders endlessly extending the time for debate on the motion for the allotment of time. The proper construction of the contingent motion is that it allows only one motion to be moved to suspend standing orders to extend the time allowed for debate on the motion for the allotment of time. Any further motion for suspension of standing orders is moved without notice and the time allowed for it must be part of the time allowed for the motion to allot time. At the expiration of the time allowed for that motion, therefore, I was obliged to put the question on all motions and amendments then before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the ruling as recorded in Hansard, I stated that once Senator Hill had moved for the suspension of standing orders he could not move a similar motion again. As I made clear on 5 December, however, a similar motion may not be moved again by any Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the suspension motion was moved for the second time on 3 December, I allowed the motion to be moved and to be put to a vote, on the basis that the time for debate on the allotment of time had not then expired, but did not allow debate on it when the time for debate had expired. When, on 5 December, Senator Hill sought to move a suspension motion for a second time, the time for debate had already expired, and the Chairman of Committees ruled that the motion was not in order in that the relevant contingent notice allowed the motion to be moved only once. The two rulings were based on the same principle: that the relevant contingent notice allows only one such motion to be moved, and any further motion is not pursuant to the contingent notice. I treated the second suspension motion moved on 3 December as being moved without notice and put it without debate; the Chairman ruled that the second suspension motion moved on 5 December was out of order because it was not in accordance with the contingent notice pursuant to which it was purportedly moved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental point underlying the rulings is that it must be the case that only one attempt can be made to seek the agreement of the Senate to extend the time available, and once the Senate has rejected such a request, the attempt cannot be made again. Each contingent notice, and any notice essentially the same, may therefore be used only once for each occurrence of the contingency for which it is intended. To rule otherwise would be to allow the proceedings to defeat the determination of the Senate that the urgent bill must be dealt with within the limited time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approach is supported by the "same question rule", which is contained in standing order 86:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A question shall not be proposed if it is the same in substance as any question which has been determined during the same session, unless the order, resolution, or vote on such question was determined more than six months previously or has been rescinded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This rule is seldom invoked and is interpreted very liberally in relation to the normal proceedings of the Senate. Where the Senate is considering a bill declared to be urgent, however, the rule should be applied more strictly to prevent successive attempts to try to get the Senate to change its mind in relation to the limitation of time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Ruling by the President on the Chairman's Ruling</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standing order 145 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.If objection is taken to a decision of the Chairman of Committees, such objection must be stated at once in writing. The Chairman shall then leave the Chair, and the Senate resume. The matter having been laid before the President, and Senators having addressed themselves to it, shall be disposed of, and the proceedings in committee shall be resumed where they were interrupted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference in the standing order to the matter being disposed of means disposed of by a ruling of the President, which can then be objected to under standing order 198. In other words, the President rules on the correctness of the Chairman's ruling. This interpretation has always been followed since the standing orders were adopted in 1903. The procedure is described in Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.When the President has taken the Chair of the Senate, the Chairman reports the dissent. . . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.It is the practice of the Senate, when a decision of the Chairman of Committees is objected to, to permit Senators to address themselves to the Question before the President gives a decision. The debate on an objection to a decision of the Chairman cannot be adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.After hearing the views of Senators, the President must give his decision. Unless objection is taken to that decision, it is binding, and the Committee resumes its work. But if objection is taken to the decision of the President, the debate upon his ruling is automatically adjourned till the next day of sitting, unless the Senate decides that the matter is one requiring immediate determination. In the meantime, the ruling of the President has to be accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This procedure has been followed with every objection to a Chairman's ruling. In recent years objections to rulings of the Chair have been extremely rare, but they were much more frequent in former years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standing order and the description of the practice in Odgers refer to the President hearing argument before ruling on the Chairman's decision. It is always open to the President, however, to determine the matter at once without hearing any debate. It may be argued that the President is under an obligation to do so when there is an order of the Senate that a bill must be dealt with within a limited time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Points of Order</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question was raised whether the Chair is obliged to hear points of order raised by Senators when the time for proceedings on an urgent bill has expired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same consideration applies to points of order as to suspension motions. It must be within the discretion of the Chair to decline to hear any further points of order and to put the questions for determining the proceedings on the urgent bill. If this were not so, it would be open to individual Senators to raise successive points of order and by that means to defeat the determination by the Senate that an urgent bill must be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chair has an obligation at all times to preserve the rights of Senators and to ensure that the procedures of the Senate are properly applied, if necessary with the assistance of Senators by way of points of order. But the Chair also has an obligation to ensure that the decisions of the majority of the Senate are carried out and are not frustrated. As I have indicated, when the Senate has made a determination that an urgent bill must be dealt with within a limited time, the Chair has a particular obligation to ensure that that determination is not subverted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this connection it should be pointed out that proceedings in the bill in question were extended for almost 3 hours beyond the time specified by the Senate, due to the suspension motions, the motion of dissent and points of order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Question Time on 5 December Senator McKiernan asked me a question about the numbers of points of order raised, and I promised to get out some figures. I table statistics relating to points of order raised during the last four periods of sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reference to Procedure Committee</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also undertook during the debate on 5 December 1991 to respond to an objection by Senator Teague to words used by Senator Evans, who referred to the Senate as a "relatively useless institution".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not hear this expression at the time. It may be regarded as contrary to standing order 193(3), which provides that a Senator "shall not use offensive words against either House of Parliament". I think, however, that I would require something rather stronger than that to invoke the standing order and require a withdrawal. Offensive language must be judged by the sensitivities of the time. I do not think that we are now so sensitive that we would regard Senator Evans' words as requiring action by the Chair.</PARA>

That is still my view, and I am happy to debate it in detail after the suspension of the sitting for dinner tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, whilst there is much in the statement with which I agree, with respect, I think it is in error in at least two parts. We have to address that because, on reading Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> I see that one of your predecessors once ruled that, if the President makes a ruling and it is not then disputed, it achieves the status of a standing order. I find somewhat incredible Presidents giving themselves that stature; nevertheless it means that if we disagree with it we have no alternative but to dissent, otherwise it attracts this particular stature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give you notice that the two areas I disagree with at the moment are: firstly, the ruling by the President on the Chairman's ruling. Paraphrasing what you say: because there was a guillotine, you argued that part of standing order 145 which says that senators shall be heard on the issue&mdash;to quote the standing order correctly `Senators having addressed themselves to it'&mdash;is overridden by the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that it seems to me that the guillotine had concluded and that the Senate was proceeding under the standing order which then provides for a voting procedure. There is nothing that I can find in the Standing Orders that indicates the voting procedure should be dealt with in any other way than any other business under the terms of the standing order. It therefore seems to me that the ruling you have made on that issue is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the other issue which seems to me to be incorrect is your ruling in relation to points of order. You argue in that instance similarly that, notwithstanding standing order 197(2), which specifically states that a senator has a right to raise a point of order at any time, that may also have been overridden by the guillotine. Again I put to you that, at the time these votes were being taken, the guillotine was not in application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be an interesting argument as to how something under the guillotine stands in relation to other provisions of the Standing Orders, but it does not seem to be the issue that you were asked specifically to direct your attention to; in other words, the issue that particularly arose during the debate the other day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue, as it arose the other day, concerned disputes when the Chairman of Committees and you refused to take points of order. It now seems, according to this considered set of reasons, that that was because the matter was under a guillotine and, therefore, inappropriate. We argue that that is wrong. Firstly, the matter was not under a guillotine and, secondly, you were obliged under the Standing Orders to take the points of order as raised and, therefore, with respect, in our opinion the determination that you have made is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I give you notice that later in this debate I will be moving dissent on both of those two issues. I do not know whether any of my colleagues want to contribute anything to the consideration before the Senate at the moment. But, at the end of whatever they wish to contribute, I will ask that the matter be adjourned until later tonight in order that all of my colleagues have an opportunity to consider the opinion that you have put before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, there are two distinct elements to your statement. The first relates to the circumstances which led to this matter being referred to you for an opinion and the second element&mdash;quite distinct from that&mdash;is how we alter our Standing Orders and procedures to resolve the uncertainties that we had at the time. The resolution of the procedural side is properly done by the Procedure Committee, and we have no argument with that. But, very clearly, the circumstances in which the dispute arose are properly a matter for the Senate and properly a matter to be debated by the Senate at this time or at a later hour this day.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I understand what the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) is saying when he talks about the program for the day. But when it is quite clear that you have made a ruling by tabling this document, and when it is also clear that the only time at which one can dissent from a ruling is at the time when it is made, there really is no choice but to make those points on those two issues right now. To refer the matter to the Procedure Committee is putting the matters into the position of having the force of a ruling that becomes, as it were, a standing order of the Senate, which makes it more difficult and a different procedure to change. In those circumstances, it seems to me that, unless some other way can be found around that dilemma, there is no course but to dissent from those two rulings at this time and agree to debate them later.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I understand it we have not yet received the addendum to your statement&mdash;it may well be that that is the document being handed out now&mdash;I ask for your guidance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I do agree with the point that Senator Hill accepted&mdash;that we will be able to address this matter when we have looked very thoroughly at the statement you have made and the addendum that has been circulated only in the last few minutes. I received this addendum directly from you&mdash;and I thank you&mdash;about a quarter of an hour ago. I just want to put on the record immediately that I am disappointed that you have found:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not hear this expression at the time. It may be regarded as contrary to standing order 193(3), which provides that a Senator "shall not use offensive words against either House of Parliament". I think, however, that I would require something rather stronger than that to invoke the standing order and require a withdrawal. Offensive language must be judged by the sensitivities of the time. I do not think that we are now so sensitive that we would regard Senator Evans' words as requiring action by the Chair.</PARA>
<PARA>I, for one, believe that it is offensive. I acknowledge your power to give a ruling. I do not question the conscientiousness of your statement, but I am still offended by the reflection of Senator Gareth Evans, in particular in these two contexts:  one was the vehemence and emotional immaturity with which Senator Evans made the remark at the time and how it was received. I noticed that Senator Vanstone immediately sought the call to take a point of order and was told by you to sit down. Later, Senator O'Chee brought this matter to the attention of the Chair. Only when you had eventually returned to the chair was I able to make a point of order, which you heard and took on notice, as it were, to give this response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason I think it is still offensive is the track record of Senator Evans in particular, more than any other senator, on derogatory descriptions of this chamber. I just want the Senate to note that I am disappointed in your statement. I believe that the statement is still offensive. You have ruled that it is not to be taken as a precedent for being contrary to standing order 193(3), but I give notice that if any other honourable senator were to use this phrase, or if Senator Evans were to repeat the phrase, I will be one senator who will again immediately take a point of order under standing order 193(3). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, many of the matters being raised now are matters that people quite rightly want to speak about. But it would seem to me that the real argument now is when the matter is to be debated. What Senator Reid said is perhaps a way out of this; that is, for people to just raise the issue, not debate it, and for the matter to be put over to an hour that can be agreed upon.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)The early rising times cause discomfort by reason of lack of sufficient sleep, since the retiring time does not alter effectively, because of the continuing heat presence at the evening delays the ability to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)The setting of the sun, in the evening during mid-summer is 7 p.m. E.S.T. (8 p.m. D/S time) which means that, for the dwelling, cooling does not take effect until late in the night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)The late time of the sun's setting, means that the evening meal is taken during a hot period of the day and, further that, should advantage of the daylight hours be taken (as said in the "for" case), the news broadcasts on radio and TV are missed, because it is impossible to do work and hear or see the programme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)With the early rising, this constitutes a long day since, if one is to take advantage(?) of this bonus time, it means that one has to work longer hours to fill in the time; the alternative is to boil while sitting at the table supposedly enjoying a meal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e)For work to be done inside the home without air-conditioning, means that the perspiration saturates any paperwork; in the tropics, the humidity is such that fans do not have an effective result and often, when the day is hot, the air is likewise very still, so a breeze is not available, to help with the cooling of the body or the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f)If study is to be undertaken under the above conditions, it is not only difficult to carry out the work, but it is difficult to concentrate while the body is uncomfortable, so that the work suffers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g)To overcome this problem, it is necessary to study into the night, which reduces the hours left for sleep, particularly so with the early hour of rising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(h)The ability of the body to resist infection or disease is reduced, because the denial of normal rest time and, since the coolest hours of the night are in that period when the sun is about to rise; that important period is denied, because of the requirement to wake up from the period of soundest sleep, to comply with the requirement of a Law, which is brought about to appease some vested interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)In the tropics, the medical profession, backed by the Government, is urging people to stay out of the sun during the heat of the day, but the proposed Law will mean that that urging on the part of the Government is wasted and with that waste, comes the added risk of persons being afflicted with sun spots and cancers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(j)The disruption of the normal daily routine of the whole State, is unnecessary, because the travel times for trains, `planes, coaches etc. can be easily adjusted to accommodate that set by interstate requirements; with the availability of recording technology, it should not be insurmountable to carry out the broadcasts to Qld. people to suit their times; it is done frequently, when it suits the broadcaster, to record programmes and play them later, because the times clash with established routine programming, or for some other reason, as it suits them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(k)With a Government sited in Canberra, the greater part of the population of the country being near to that City's latitude, the lesser populated areas are going to be given Cavalier treatment, when it means their comfort and health compared to the populations near the seat of Government&mdash;another reason why we want the decision to remain with the State Government, who will stand or fall, on the wishes of the people affected, in this matter; if Canberra is saturated with politicians, who have no sympathy for the people in Queensland, this State will suffer for its inclusion in the Commonwealth&mdash;one of the reasons that the Senate was created being, that lesser populated States would have equal voice with the more populated States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the statement I made was quite clear. In my view it is entirely unnecessary to contemplate sitting on 20 December for any procedural requirement that I can see. The Leader of the House, Mr Beazley, advises me that he has given that advice to Dr Hewson and Mr Fife, so I am telling honourable senators that. If he asks me whether I think it is necessary, I will say no. Honourable senators would not want me to not tell them that he had given that piece of advice. That is something of which I am now aware and I am telling the Senate. It is not a secret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is not necessary for the House of Representatives or the Senate to sit on 20 December. If we work in a reasonably orderly manner, the agreement which we reached last week is quite easily achievable&mdash;that is, we can finish the required work in the sitting days that we indicated last week, being four days this week and two days next week. I am in no doubt that with reasonable cooperation that remains achievable. But if that cooperation is not forthcoming, more days may be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I cannot give a categoric indication of what the sitting of the Senate will be. As long as cooperation continues, I will implement what I thought was an agreement with the Opposition to pass the Government's legislative program in the six sitting days set down. In my view, this is perfectly easily achievable. It would include passing some legislation on the 18th and 19th and also dealing with some matters returned to us from the House of Representatives on those days. Obviously, there will be some Bills returned but, of course, it is impossible to predict at this stage what that legislation will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always the case at the end of sittings that legislation that has been amended in the Senate passes between the two Houses and requires consideration by each House. Therefore, both Houses need to sit on the same days. So it is perfectly easily achievable, with the bare modicum of cooperation, that we can pass the necessary legislation and deal with any disagreements between the Houses in six sitting days, including today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is my current intention and it is consistent with the indication given by the Leader of the House. He is being understandably abundantly cautious in saying, `Well, we may need the 20th'. In my view, it will not be required. I believe that the Senate can, with the bare minimum of cooperation, maintain that legislative program. I am happy to talk again to the Opposition about that matter at any time it wants to have a discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) has concentrated tonight on the mere modicum of cooperation that has come from the Opposition. We have done nothing but cooperate with the Government. Indeed, we were promised that we could get up on 13 December as long as we passed certain legislation. A short time after we agreed to that and were bending over backwards and cooperating fully with the Government, the Government and the Manager of Government Business in the Senate in particular, broke their promise and included the ad bans legislation in the list, although it had never been part of the original agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Last week a gag was put on a Bill that was of vital importance. We had declared from the very beginning that it was the most important Bill ever to come before the Senate. It was a Bill that banned freedom of speech and freedom of the media, the like of which we have never seen in this country before. The Government, breaking its promise, gagged the Bill and then complained bitterly when we chose to take all those hours that we needed to debate it by sitting through the night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government had to withdraw the gag, because of its dreadful drafting, so that amendments could be made to the Bill. The Government was incapable of putting forward a Bill that did not ignore the various situations in various States. The Government had to drop the gag of its own volition and take away the Bill to amend it, not once, but twice. The Government's behaviour was utterly disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Manager of Government Business in the Senate says, `We can get through on the 18th, 19th and 20th so long as we cooperate'. Well, I am telling the Manager of Government Business that there will be no cooperation by the Opposition from now on because we cannot rely on his word. We cannot rely on his promises and we cannot rely on any of his offers. He stood in this place during the debate on procedural motions and agreed with Senator Ray and the Opposition that the Chairman had not made the correct decision, and said that he agreed with us and would vote with us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said that section 145 of the Standing Orders could be agreed to. He agreed that the Senate should debate the procedural motion but, before anyone on this side of the chamber had a chance to say a word, he gagged it. That is how much faith we can place in his promises and his indications to us, and he will get no cooperation at all from us. If those opposite want to sit through until President Bush comes then, okay, let us do it. We do not care. We would like to have Bob Hawke up here. We would like a few Caucus meetings. I do not think Bob wants them. We would like a few Caucus meetings held because then those opposite might come to their senses and decide that getting rid of him is the best of all evils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is in crisis. It is an appalling situation when the country is being run by a group of so-called Ministers fighting over how long they can keep their Prime Minister and, meanwhile, more than one million people are unemployed and in the dole queues. All those opposite can argue about is whether Mr Keating might be better able to use vitriolic phrases against our GST package than the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister sacked his Treasurer because the Prime Minister could not find any holes in the package. Because there is nothing to attack, he shoots the messenger. It is not the Minister's fault he cannot find holes in it; it is not the Treasurer's fault that it is watertight. Now we have another Treasurer, the second string. The cartoon in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> showing the Prime Minister poking his head out of a Treasury office and saying `Next!' is a delight because it shows up better than any words could the shambles the Government is in. Senator McMullan should not come in here and ask us for cooperation. When he decides that he will behave decently in this place there might be some cooperation from the Opposition. Until he decides to behave decently he should not ask us to cooperate because we do not trust his word. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan talks with his eyes closed; I do not know whether he sleeps with his eyes closed. I want to get something straight here: there has been an agreement. Senator McMullan knows that, I know that, and the chamber knows that. Right from the word go in this session the Whips had a communication that, if the necessary legislation that was set down was actually passed in an orderly fashion without necessarily truncating proper debate, there was a possibility that we could finish by 13 December and actually spend some time in the electorates we are meant to be servicing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well understand that those opposite do not necessarily want us out and about in our electorates, because they are struggling against the Fightback package. But surely that is not a good enough reason to back off on an agreement that was quite clearly made. I think there was some confusion by my colleague, Senator Walters, about the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991. While we recognised that that was always on the list right from the word go, there was never a hint that that debate was going to be cut short in the way in which it was, and that we were not going to be allowed sufficient time to properly debate it, let alone have sufficient time to look at the 37-plus amendments that the Government would move to that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stunt pulled last week&mdash;one of many&mdash;to have the debate curtailed was just a real smart alec effort. It is something that the Opposition has not appreciated in any way, shape or form. It is just a further matter in which the agreement that was made back in August has now come asunder. If those opposite think that things are going to be smooth sailing from here on in, I would suggest respectfully that they think again because by 20 December&mdash;the date that those opposite are now talking about&mdash;we will have been here six out of seven weeks. I am not saying that we will not sit whenever those opposite want to sit&mdash;we will. As Senator Walters quite rightly said, if those opposite want to sit until President Bush arrives, so be it, but at least tell us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only Thursday of last week, the last sitting day before today, that Senator McMullan came around here and said to us that he was going to make a statement to the Senate saying that we would be sitting the six days&mdash;Monday to Thursday of this week, and Wednesday and Thursday of the following week. Now, tonight, we find that that is all very different. But the one question that I have not been able to find an answer to, and I would be appreciative of an answer&mdash;it is a question that Senator Alston has also asked&mdash;is this: what legislation that we have left is necessary? What bits of legislation are necessary?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I can ascertain there is absolutely nothing that it is crucial to pass now. What we face year in, year out, at the beginning of every session, is a situation where the Senate sits around like a collection of pot-plants waiting for legislation to come from the House of Representatives. Yet before we leave this place it appears that the Government is requesting us to pass legislation that is not necessary now so that we can come back next year and sit around like pot-plants for a week or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few sessions&mdash;this session; the previous session, the autumn session; and the last Budget session&mdash;we have almost had to shut shop here because the Government has run out of business. We are now faced with a situation where the Government has gone that extra step of sneaking legislation into the Senate to bypass the cut-off date for introduction of new legislation into the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the intent of the decision of the Senate to have a cut-off date has been bypassed by Senator McMullan and the Government to make sure, once again&mdash;smart alecs&mdash;that the Government has other pieces of legislation coming in here. Where do we stand on all of this? Why is it necessary to go through the motions of what Senator McMullan is now suggesting? Why, since the last day of sitting, have we had a change in sitting dates from 18 and 19 December to 18, 19 and 20 December?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather decent for some people to be able to plan what they will do. If it is the Government's wish that we sit through until 31 December or 2 January, when President Bush arrives, how about doing the decent thing and telling us? Mr Deputy President, I would certainly like Senator McMullan to tell the Senate whether the agreement that was set down by all parties in August is still in existence and, if not, why not? I would like him to tell us what legislation is necessary, because I cannot see any that is, and I would like him to tell us whether it will be a Government requirement&mdash;and whether it has done a deal with the Democrats yet again&mdash;that the adjournment be negated night in, night out, in order to get through the legislation that the Government is now saying is so essential, though nobody else can see why. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to clarify in my own mind and for the benefit of the Senate what Senator McMullan has said. I was watching my television when he rose to make a statement tonight. He said something. By the time I got down here in the chamber he was apparently saying something different. I was walking down the steps so I may be mistreating Senator McMullan by suggesting that. Certainly what he said at 8 o'clock, which I heard on the television, was that&mdash;and I think these were the words&mdash;people who had cared to check, including Dr Hewson, had been told that they should make themselves available for 18 and 19 December. He did not say that the House of Representatives would be sitting but that people should be on guard, on stand-by, in case it was sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator McMullan has said since I walked down the steps seems to have changed. I would like Senator McMullan, by leave if necessary, again to give us a guarantee that the House of Representatives will be sitting on 18 and 19 December&mdash;and, if necessary, 20 December. I suspect that the last thing this Government wants to do is to bring Caucus back together before Christmas, because, as the newspapers are full of today&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or to put Mr Hawke in front of Dr Hewson. The last thing that Mr Hawke will want is a gathering of his opponents within the Labor Party, the Keating supporters, who could get together, have a Caucus meeting and do the deed before President Bush comes. I am quite sure that it will happen after President Bush is here. I am sure that is part of the deal with the Left. The Left will let Mr Hawke stay to see President Bush and then he will find some excuse and walk away. My feeling is that the Government is desperate not to have Caucus meet in case things happen before then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like Senator McMullan to assure us that there will be a meeting. He may well say that if the Government wants to have a Caucus meeting, overthrow Mr Hawke and install Mr Keating, it is none of my business&mdash;and that is probably right. What is my business is that we went through this farce of one of the most important pieces of legislation in the history of this Parliament&mdash;the proposal to ban free speech in this country&mdash;having to be guillotined because it had to be dealt with, for some reason, before the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats, with the very noticeable and courageous exception of Senator Sowada, went along with that furphy. As I understand it, the Labor Party was trying to pretend that this legislation had to be dealt with so that the House of Representatives could deal with it and it could become law before the Parliament met again in February. That was the reason why we had to deal with it in that way and the Democrats were sold that argument. If the House of Representatives does not come back and does not agree with the amendments, that would be an enormous breach of faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason why I have an interest in the matter, and that is the reason why the Senate has an interest in the matter. I want a double assurance from Senator McMullan that the House of Representatives will meet some time between now and Christmas. Whilst I believe Senator McMullan&mdash;and it would be improper for me not to believe him&mdash;I do suspect that forces are moving over which Senator McMullan has no control. I think those forces may determine that the last thing the Government wants is for the other chamber to come back before Christmas. I ask Senator McMullan for that assurance. As I have said, what he said changed from what I saw him say on the television at 8 p.m. and what he said when I arrived in the chamber, but no doubt Senator McMullan will give a categorical statement that the House will meet between now and Christmas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Advance to the Minister for Finance involves some considerable additional expenditure which I am certain the Senate will find quite interesting. Particularly interesting is the Department of Employment, Education and Training. An extra $22m is to be allocated specifically in relation to Austudy&mdash;in other words, age-related student allowances&mdash;but another $5m is also to be allocated for Abstudy and $6.3m for labour market program assistance to job seekers in industry. Altogether it is something like $32m. This is extra money which was not in the Budget and which the Parliament is now being asked to agree to as part of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. It is interesting to note that the reason given for the increase in the Austudy payment is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments under Austudy are income support and are often the only means of income for recipients, it is therefore urgent that these payments are made.</PARA>
<PARA>That is self-evidently true. But the reasons continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The supply estimate calculation in March 1991 did not anticipate the increases in beneficiary numbers that have taken place.</PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly, not only did the Budget wrongly estimate by a very considerable amount the demand for Austudy, but it also  reinforced what we have been saying here for some time, that is, that Austudy payments are being used by this Government as an alternative to unemployment benefit. The reason there is this huge increase&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely correct. Disability pensions and sickness benefits are also being used as proxies, or substitutes, for unemployment benefits. In this way the Government hides the real impact of unemployment. What we see here with this $22m underfunding of Austudy so far is a clear indication that the Government underestimated Austudy needs because many young Australians could not find jobs and have gone back to schools, universities or to other institutions of learning as it is their second choice. Basically, they may as well increase their skills because they cannot get a job. For many young people, that course of action is a very useful procedure, and may well increase their options if and when further jobs become available. We know that under the present Government's policies there is no prospect of jobs for them. This Government and some of its advisers are now conceding that there will be a 10 per cent unemployment rate in general for at least three years, and that the 30 per cent unemployment rate amongst young Australians under the age of 20 unsuccessfully seeking full time employment will persist as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have clear evidence in these figures that this Government not only massively understated the extent of the recession it said we `had to have', and massively understated the amount of unemployment it would create, but also exposed the fact that it uses Austudy as an alternative for unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at what the real level of unemployment is under this Government, there is no doubt now that we should look very closely at some of these huge increases for Austudy and the other benefits that Senator Alston indicated. It is certainly far higher than the official statistics, and this Advance to the Minister for Finance simply confirms what we have been saying for quite some time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Advance to the Minister for Finance has become an important indicator as to how well or how badly individual departments are run. At the risk of again putting down something which other people may have become aware of, but which I suspect most people are not aware of, during the last Estimates hearings I obtained an undertaking from the Department of Finance that it would not only maintain a register of those departments which made applications for an Advance to the Minister for Finance and were unsuccessful or successful, but also publish that list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly interested in the manner in which preparation is done, how well or how badly overall calculations for estimates are made, and how well or how badly a department is administered. I believe that the number of applications which fail to gain acceptance against the Advance to the Minister for Finance, as well as those that ultimately are accepted&mdash;I understand that some of them have two or three goes&mdash;will be a good indicator as to who is doing an adequate job and who is not doing an adequate job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly interested in the item under the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, `Australian Customs Service&mdash;Other services. Compensation and legal expenses $389,000'. When we go to the supporting documentation, we read that the explanation for the requirement from the AMF is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to an unforeseen compensation payment of $589,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a pretty substantial sum&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">resulting from a court ruling against the Commonwealth in October 1991 after the Supply bills were prepared. The funds available for payment now total $10,411. As we have on hand payments in the vicinity of $400,000 to be made before 22 November 1991 the additional amount of $389,000 is requested to cover payments which must be made.</PARA>
<PARA>People who are used to dealing in litigation&mdash;and surely Customs must be&mdash;would know that when they are looking at the sorts of pay-outs they may have to deal with, they are obliged to do estimates of what work in progress may result in. It is a common practice in ordinary legal practice and I do not see why Customs cannot do it more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have yet to debate the annual report because it came in late, but the draft annual report was made available to the Estimates Committee. If my memory serves me correctly, in that report there were an enormous number&mdash;in excess of 300&mdash;of cases down for investigation. They were supposed to yield&mdash;again if my memory serves me correctly&mdash;$54m worth of duty which was to be recovered. In fact, there were only 45 commercial actions and the amount recovered was in the vicinity of $3m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long and the short of it is that the Advance to the Minister for Finance is being used to advance what amounts to verdict moneys, without the particulars of the case even being included in the documentation. Dare I suggest that if I go through the annual report I will find very little, if any, provision for decisions which may go against the Commonwealth. I can only say again that the inquiry that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is holding into the Customs Service is probably way overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that the amount of correspondence that has come in from all over the community saying just that&mdash;that this inquiry into and shake-up of the Australian Customs Service is way overdue&mdash;is borne out by the fact that Customs is requiring money from the Advance to the Minister for Finance the validity of which, quite frankly, I would query. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the 1990-91 annual report of the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council, known as EXANDIS. This is the first annual report of EXANDIS and it covers the 15 months to 30 June 1991. On previous occasions when I have spoken on documents in this place, I have spoken about how Australia must keep its product clean and pure if we are to compete in the world. That is one special feature of Australia, compared with all other countries in the world, being an island continent. If an exotic disease came into Australia, we could suffer catastrophic problems in our animal industries. The establishment of EXANDIS, which is a consultative council, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to raise the level of Australia's disease preparedness and improve the range and timeliness of advice to the Government on exotic animal disease issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The composition of EXANDIS is aimed to represent the interests of all those concerned with the livestock industries potentially vulnerable to exotic disease.</PARA>
<PARA>If diseases such as foot and mouth disease got into Australia and among our wild pigs and other wild animals, they would cause untold damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eight-member Council includes an independent chairman; one member representing the Australian Agricultural Council; one member representing the Department of Primary Industries and Energy; two members who are nominees from the National Farmers Federation to ensure that the views of the livestock industries are effectively represented; and three members with special qualifications and expertise in such areas as disaster emergency management, communications and public relations, agricultural marketing, the veterinary profession, et cetera. The secretariat services are provided by DPIE in Canberra. The Council's objects and functions are to inquire into, assess and report to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on the adequacy of the strategies and procedures provided in any approved veterinary emergency plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council has had a very heavy workload over the past 15 months or more. I would like to commend the Council on the AUSVETPLAN. The AUSVETPLAN documents have been completed and represent a set of uniform strategic and operational plans for the technical aspects of exotic animal disease emergency response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of EXANDIS cannot be overemphasised when it is realised that, as I said earlier, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease would do untold damage. It was estimated that the cost in the first year of such an outbreak would be about $8 billion. Obviously, we would have to deal with such an outbreak very quickly and that is what this group of dedicated people in EXANDIS would do. They have a plan to handle such an outbreak, if it ever eventuated. But, of course, the most important thing is to make sure that it does not happen to Australia and that we do not lose beef markets or any other export markets. I commend the annual report of EXANDIS to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>A section of this document explains quite clearly why supporting applications are an important and useful part of government financing. Supporting applications show the reasons behind advances made to the Minister for Finance during the month. Many of these advances are, of course, soundly based. That is why when we criticise some that are not soundly based or that arise from incompetence, we are pointing out real errors by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One item in these supporting applications demonstrates the quite proper use of this Advance. I refer to the item that relates to the tragic accident in which RAAF aircrew were killed in a 707 plane crash on 29 October 1991. The payment of compensation for the families of the RAAF personnel killed would clearly not have been provided for in the Budget. Therefore, the allocation of $744,670 by way of compensation is quite proper. It would be totally improper to complain about this sort of additional expenditure because clearly it should be made and clearly there was no capacity for it to be known at Budget time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These papers also contain an explanation of why the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services needs another $6.7m. This is exactly the sort of request that is disgraceful and represents real incompetence by a government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government decided in the Budget that it would need co-payments for medical payments. We now find that the costs of doing this were not included in the Budget. The supporting material states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supply allocation did not provide for additional staffing and administrative expenses resulting from Budget new policy initiatives agreed after the preparation of Supply Estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>This happens to total $6.7m. The Government is quite prepared to introduce measures of substance in the Budget, but it is not prepared to outline in the Budget the costs of implementing those new measures. It seems incredible that this can be taken for granted. The supporting material continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Costs associated with the Medical Benefits co-payment Budget initiative are being incurred under this sub-division until 1 December 1991 . . . these costs need to be incurred in order to achieve implementation of the Medicare co-payment arrangements by the specified date. The shortfall in Administrative Expenses relates directly to these costs. . . The AMF &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Advance to the Minister for Finance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">requirement is urgent as there are insufficient funds in Salaries to cover Pay 10 . . . and claims for payment must be paid by the due date. The AMF requirement was unforeseen as the higher level of funding required . . . was unknown at the time of the preparation of Supply estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply unsatisfactory. If the Government is so competent when it introduces the Medicare co-payment, a significant measure, and is prepared to put the proceeds of it in its Budget, why does it not have the honesty to also include in the Budget the costs involved with the project? The answer is simple: it is either incompetence or deception. We are having to put up with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December we are at last being told that $6.7m extra is needed to implement this Budget decision. What chicanery! What an absolute fraud this Government is. The Government's Budget was wrong by an amount of $6.7m. One simply has to ask: was this deliberate or was it due to incompetence? On the Government's track record, particularly the way it has been dealing with the coalition's rescue package for Australia, it is probably fraud. This Government did not want a Budget that showed the reality of its costs; it wanted to bamboozle the people of Australia with figures&mdash;figures which have now clearly been shown to be wrong. How can the Australian people be sucked in once again by a Government which cannot add up the figures in its own documents yet tries to attack the coalition's document? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Supporting Applications of Issues from the Advances to the Minister for Finance during the Month of November 1991</EMPHASIS>, I refer to the document from the Department of Administrative Services relating to an advance of over half a million dollars which falls into the category of `urgent and erroneously understated'. The advance relates to errors made with regard to superannuation dealt with by the Department during the last financial year. The most significant part of the accompanying documentation is the fourth paragraph of a document called `Part 1'. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late last financial year, the Senate Estimates committee requested details of overtime payments made to staff of members of Parliament. An examination of the overtime component of the salary ledgers for 1990/91 established that there were integrity problems with the ledgers caused by coding errors. It needs to be kept in mind that the faults and shortcomings, the rectification of which has now led to this approach for funds, would most likely not have been detected but for the action of the Branch.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we could re-write that to say, `It would not have been detected if not for action by the Senate Estimates committees'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government likes to deride the effectiveness and importance of the Estimates committees, largely because they result in embarrassment for the Government. It is not surprising that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) is embarrassed&mdash;he frequently is. Here is yet another example of the Department not getting it right. Yet the documentation tries to say, `It is really okay, because we nearly got it right'. Quite clearly, that attitude will not do in departments or in Australia as a whole. We have to aspire to, and achieve, better than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important point to make concerning this particular application against the Advance is that even the language that is used&mdash;ADP payments and so on&mdash;is rather dated. The point I make is the importance of the Senate Estimates committees and the importance of the members of those committees resisting the Minister responsible for this particular Committee, Senator Bolkus. He is one such Minister who chooses to fight any sure investigation. There are other Ministers who find the investigations of Estimates committees more useful. That is usually the mark of a good Minister. The documentation goes on to outline how the Government will improve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to make is that this document is yet another example of the way that government departments, particularly those under Ministers who are less than well equipped, make gross errors. It is particularly pertinent to the model that has been established within Treasury under the guidance or otherwise of Senator McMullan and whichever Treasurer we happen to have at the time&mdash;</PARA>

When the Government set up this model and started to test the costings of the goods and services tax and the overall Fightback package&mdash;which we have on admission in the Estimates committees has been set up within Treasury at the instigation and instruction of the former Treasurer (Mr Kerin) to spend taxpayers' money on party political work&mdash;the question that we will always be able to ask ourselves is: how worth while or how reliable is the sort of work that they do? It should be borne in mind that the figuring for the last Budget was out by $7.7 billion and that we see errors in the Department of Administrative Services, which means therefore that other budgeted figures have been blown out. In other words, it is the work as overseen by the Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My criticism is of the Ministers who have the responsibility for oversighting the work of those public servants. Public servants are answerable to the Ministers and to the Executive. The reliability and the scrutiny of the Ministers is certainly lacking. It is borne out only through the Estimates committees where we finally get accountability to the Parliament that we see how defective this Executive Government, as personified by the Ministers, really is. </PARA>

<PARA>The foreword on the first page of the annual report of the Freedom of Information Act shows that the overall cost of the administration of the Act in the year in which it reported was almost $10m. A total of $351,000 was collected in fees and charges, an increase of some 13.5 per cent. The average amount collected per request was $14.10 compared with $13.21 last year. The average cost per request to each agency was $398, a similar amount to the cost incurred last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of these figures, one wonders why the Government saw fit to introduce earlier this year the Freedom of Information Amendment Bill which introduced further restrictions preventing citizens from obtaining information under the legislation. At the time, the Australian Democrats voiced concern about various amendments that the Government proposed to introduce. One amendment that I drew attention to proposed to force people, if they wished to obtain personal information in an agency, to use internal proceedings first, even if that could have affected their careers or was personally embarrassing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next area we expressed concern about was that an agency could actually refuse to supply information if a substantial diversion of resources were to occur within the agency; and that decision is to be made at the agency's discretion and in its judgment. The definition of `commercial activities' was widened further, but it was not clearly stated exactly what commercial activities were to come under that particular heading. Finally, an agency is able now to delete what it considers to be irrelevant material from the material that is provided upon an FOI request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these amendments were foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats. However, we could not at the time get any support from either the Government or the Opposition for these amendments. Consequently, the Bill was passed as introduced by the Government, imposing all these restrictions. In view of the report that we are dealing with today, I wonder whether it was really necessary, if we had a total cost of $10m for the necessary provision of freedom of information for our citizens, to try to save an additional few thousand dollars at the expense of citizens' rights to obtain information under the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>The Senate established the Select Committee on Superannuation on 5 June 1991 to inquire into and report upon a wide range of matters relating to superannuation. The Committee has already received and published over 130 submissions from a wide range of persons and organisations interested in superannuation. Reflecting the importance of the issues under consideration, the financial and general press have commented on the submissions from some of the more important players in the field. The Committee welcomes the analysis of issues occurring in the press, because it is only through public airing and discussion of the complexities and problems with superannuation that the Committee can produce a meaningful report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation arrangements existing in other countries is one of the matters included in the Committee's terms of reference. The purpose of the paper I am tabling is to provide a general overview of the retirement income arrangements from a selected number of OECD countries and two other nations which have unusual retirement income systems. It is worth noting the trends which the survey reveals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, of the 21 countries that were surveyed, only three have mandatory employer contributions lower than Australia's current 3 per cent. Chile, the Netherlands and New Zealand do not require any employer contributions towards superannuation retirement income. Secondly, if the full phasing in of the current Government's 9 per cent target for superannuation is achieved, there would still be 13 countries with mandatory contributions from employers greater than Australia. So even if a 9 per cent target is reached we will be only mid-way through the pack. Thirdly, from the employee's contribution aspect, Australia again also appears to be close to the bottom of the table. Ireland, Sweden and New Zealand alone are the only countries not requiring mandatory employee contributions towards some sort of superannuation pension retirement fund. Fourthly, of the 21 countries surveyed, only two allow pension funds to be drawn on for housing purposes&mdash;Singapore and Belgium. </PARA>

Those three countries are Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. Nine of the 21 countries have a lower retirement age for females than for males. Three of those nine countries are increasing the female retirement age to the same as the male retirement age. In particular, the United States is increasing the retirement age to 67 for both sexes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point that comes out of the report is that very few countries allow the use of retirement or pension funds for other purposes. However, both Singapore and Spain are notable exceptions. They both have very high contribution rates. Singapore has a combined employer-employee contribution rate of 40 per cent and Spain has a combined employer-employee contribution rate of 45.8 per cent. In Spain the superannuation payments also cover sickness and family allowance payments. I have already mentioned that in Singapore, superannuation payments go towards housing and, interestingly, contributions also go towards the local Singapore bus company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the direction of investment, it is particularly interesting to note the current controversy concerning the Maxwell printing empire where #300m of pension moneys have in some way been misdirected as a result of investing the money in the employer's company. That is an area that this Committee will be looking at in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes the material is a useful reference point against which the community can address one of the key questions which has emerged from the terms of reference of the inquiry. That question is: what are the objectives of Australia's retirement income policy and what role does superannuation have in it? This and other questions will be further explored in the public hearings the Committee will hold from February next year. Full details on the location and timing of these hearings are included on page ii of the paper I have tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to advise the Senate that the Committee has worked in a constructive and non-partisan way to date. It is my sincere hope that this will continue. Although public hearings will not commence until early next year, the Committee has benefited from a series of informal briefings from government agencies and industry bodies at seven separate meetings, as well as attendance by members of the Committee at various conferences that have been held around the country on superannuation. The briefings have allowed Committee members to familiarise themselves with the extremely complex issues on which they are required to report and will greatly assist the examination of witnesses at the public hearings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to touch on three areas in this initial discussion of the work of the Select Committee on Superannuation, and those are: first, the relevance of international experience and comparison; secondly, the question of equity and taxation concessions; and thirdly, the question of the productive investment of superannuation fund assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a history of being a very insular and xenophobic nation, for a variety of reasons. Australian politicians have a history of selectively using overseas examples in very inconsistent ways. Whilst there are unique factors applying to Australia, I argue that in the area of superannuation or retirement incomes in general, international experience is totally relevant because of the common human needs of all retired people. As such, I commend the Committee for tabling this important discussion paper which will make an important contribution to public debate. As can be seen from this report, compulsory, government controlled superannuation is the normal system in many comparable countries, not some sort of aberration designed to disadvantage our employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area that I want to touch on is that of the appropriate form of taxation concessions which should apply to contributions to superannuation funds. The current system of deductions is extremely regressive and must be changed. Even though only a few months ago the former Treasurer, Mr Kerin, acknowledged that the current arrangements were unfair, he stated that the Government did not intend to address the problem. Then, interestingly, the Opposition in its Fightback package has presented an alternative system of concessions which rely on the much fairer principle of tax rebates instead of tax deductions. The dollar value of the tax benefit is then equal for all taxpayers who make contributions which qualify for the concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final area is the question of the investment of superannuation savings. The rationalist line is that the market knows best and that the national interest does not exist. The Democrats' policy calls for a national development fund using funds from superannuation funds and other sources such as resource taxes to be established to assist sustainable industries to grow and to provide some of the development capital which the deregulated private sector financial institutions just have not provided. There is no doubt as to the existence of this market failure in this area, but there is doubt about what should be done to address it. This question is before the Committee. We will be considering the evidence from various sources. I hope that the members of the Committee consider and vote in the national interest in this regard and not in the short term interests of their parties. I commend the paper. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a report which presents additional information received by the Committee. I am waiting for some information from one of my advisers about some concerns I have about this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 November I wrote to the Secretary of Senate Estimates Committee C expressing concern about some outstanding responses to questions on notice from the Department of Social Security. I want to go through some of those because I think it is important to make sure that the Department is fully aware of the questions I have asked. It seems to me that when a Department says that it will get information or that it does not have it at the time, we should not have to go through the nonsense of saying, `I therefore put that on notice and ask that you bring it back to the Senate'. For example, when we were discussing the people who had been tendering to carry out an inquiry, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And they were all Australian companies?</PARA>
<PARA>I received the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Godfrey</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I think the answer to that question is yes, all the companies were Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Volker, the head of the Department, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will just have a look at the list and see whether they are Australian.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>I presumed from that answer that Mr Volker was going to come back to me to tell me whether those companies were Australian. I do not believe that I need to say, `I therefore want to draw it to the Committee's attention that this question is on notice'. I would presume that the intention there is that I would get an answer to that question, but I have not. There are quite a number of other examples such as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Department does not have an answer to a question we should sit there until it gets the answer. If it is not going to respond to questions on notice, we should sit and wait until it gives us the answer. Obviously when a department does not have the answer immediately we say, `Would you get that for us?', and the officers say, `We will do that'. In this case, the bureaucrats of this Department are responding in a way that I think is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another case the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) was asked about the incidence of people in nursing homes receiving telephone vouchers. I asked whether we could go back and have a look at how many were in that category, because there were quite a few and it would not be correct in the discussion we were having at the time. Senator Richardson said, `Perhaps we could prepare a response for you'. I presumed that the Committee would get a response in that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked for a list of internal audit titles that had been undertaken by the DSS. It said it would not provide the actual audits but that it would give me a list. That list has not been forthcoming. I asked whether all tenderers for a contract for a child support survey were Australian companies, an example I gave earlier. I also asked the Department why it had not provided me with a copy of the questionnaire of the child support survey. I had asked for a copy of the child support survey and the results. It seems that the Department had something fixed in its head&mdash;it did not want to provide the questionnaire until the whole report was available. What I would like, and what I asked for, was the child support survey. I requested a copy of this questionnaire forthwith. I asked for a copy of the report when it became available. I understand that the report may still not be available and I have not seen a copy of the questionnaire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised those concerns because sometimes the departments might think that they will not go back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and look it up and that they can get away with not answering it. That is not the case. We go through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> very carefully. We do not ask these questions for the good of our health; we ask them for a purpose. I ask the Minister to instruct the Department to answer the questions as they have been asked, in the spirit in which they have been asked, without having to make it formal, which is what we may have to do if we do not get the response that I think is appropriate for the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on notice that we are still concerned we have not had those responses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last few years the collapse, or near collapse, of several large unlisted property trusts has highlighted an inherent problem in the management of these kinds of trusts. When unit holders bought units in unlisted property trusts, they bought on terms and conditions which were set out in trust deeds. The trust deeds always set out the period of notice which had to be given before they could get their money out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When unit holders of property trusts wanted their money back, they would ask the managers to buy back their investments. The management company usually redeemed the units from the assets of the trust. In the past, unit holders were able to withdraw their investments at relatively short notice. Since March 1988 it has been obligatory, pursuant to a requirement of the NCSC, that all trust deeds contain a 60-day notice provision. Such short periods were essentially inconsistent with the nature of property investment, where underlying assets can only be liquidated in the long term, particularly once the boom was over and the market became bogged down in the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Borrowing short term and investing long term is an obvious recipe for disaster which is, of course, what has happened. Unlisted property trusts are now facing a huge slump in commercial property values because of the recession. Consequently, the trusts are having difficulty attracting new investments and also selling property. At the same time, investors realised that the assets underlying the trusts were not sufficient to justify the earlier valuations and began to bale out. The inevitable result of large numbers of redemption and buy-back requests at short notice is the liquidity problems which ensued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many unlisted property trusts were forced into the highly undesirable position of having to put freezes on withdrawals. Others just crashed. Since July 1990 the NCSC, and since 1 January this year the Australian Securities Commission, have been investigating options for improving the liquidity of unlisted property trusts. The major bank and life insurance owned fund managers have also been advising the Government on the deteriorating state of the property trust industry. In fact, the six major institution backed funds requested that the Government impose a freeze because of the deteriorating state of their, and other, trusts. It was obvious that some sort of Government intervention would be necessary to prevent any further rush of investors seeking to withdraw their funds from unlisted property trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 23 July this year the Government announced that it intended to legislate to restore confidence in the unlisted property trust industry. In yet another example of legislation by press release, it was announced that there would be a standard 12-month notice period for withdrawal of funds from any of the existing unlisted property trusts, with effect from the date of that announcement. The major concern of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the former Treasurer, Mr Kerin, in making this announcement was to ensure that small unit holders were protected as property trusts were restructured. They were also concerned to avoid trusts being forced to sell property in an already depressed real estate market. It is fair to say that the market has deteriorated even more since 23 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the announcement was made, about $6 billion in funds invested by about 300,000 investors was affected. In the announcement of 23 July, details of the new regulatory structure, based on recommendations of the Australian Securities Commission, were also revealed. Unlisted property trusts and management companies would be required to maintain adequate liquidity. Breach of the liquidity requirements would result in the investors being able to meet to consider, among other options, the replacement of the trust manager and the listing of the trust or its termination. Borrowing by trusts would be limited to 20 per cent of the gross assets of a trust, and a capital adequacy requirement would be set for management companies based on the value of the assets of the trusts they had under their management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of this announcement, the transitional rules for fund managers were also announced. The Corporations (Unlisted Property Trusts) Amendment Bill implements all the measures announced in the 23 July press release. It is a matter of some concern to the Opposition that the freeze was announced on 23 July and, therefore, has been in place for over four months with no legislative basis whatsoever. The Bill provides that 12 months' notice will be required in relation to buy-backs and redemptions from unlisted property trusts in existence on the date of the Attorney-General's announcement on 23 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an exemption in cases of demonstrated financial hardship for unit holders, who will be able to buy back without waiting the 12 months at a discount not exceeding 7.5 per cent. The Bill also provides for unit holders to vary the 12-month period if it is commercially viable to do so. The trustee or the management company will be able to apply to the ASC for any variation to be disallowed. The ASC will also be able to permit the trustee to refuse redemptions from trust assets where it is satisfied that such redemptions are likely to adversely affect the value of remaining units or otherwise prejudice the interests of remaining unit holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is only part of the scheme. There are still regulations being developed by the Attorney-General's Department. This Bill also changes the requirement in relation to unit trusts generally that trust deeds can be changed only where the changes are approved by an absolute majority of unit holders. Under this Bill, amendments may be made where they are approved by 75 per cent of unit holders voting at a meeting. A further amendment provides for unit holders to requisition meetings with the trustee for the purpose of giving directions to the trustee or management company in relation to the affairs of the trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also empowers the corporations and security panel to make interim orders pending its final determinations of applications before it. This is a necessary amendment in view of the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in the recent Keydata case that the panel does not have power to make interim orders. The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech in the other place, noted that the standard notice of withdrawal period of 12 months would not of itself solve the liquidity problems of unlisted property trusts. The intention is that the freeze gives the trust time to restructure its operations in consultation with unit holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That time that has been created has been used by most of the trusts to restructure. Many of the major trusts have been meeting with their unit holders and arranging the flotation of their trusts during that period and many more are planned for the period between now and the end of the freeze. But, of course, as the Attorney-General noted, it will not solve the liquidity problems that were created by the downturn in the property market as a result of the recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent revaluation of Grosvenor Place in Sydney is a very good example of a rapid reduction in the asset backing of some of these trusts with a property that probably 18 months ago would have been sold at a capitalisation rate of something around 5 per cent being revalued at a capitalisation rate of 7.65 per cent as recently as last week&mdash;which shows the underlying weakness in the commercial property market in Australia. Perth, Melbourne and Sydney, and Adelaide to a lesser extent, have enormous vacancy rates in prime central city office towers which make up most of the portfolios of some of these trusts with vacancy rates, as I have said, of 20 per cent to 25 per cent predicted within 18 months in some of those cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that the Government expects all necessary restructuring to be completed by the end of July next year. One of the solutions is for such property trusts to be listed. As I have said, that is under way with many of them. On this matter, I note the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 13 November that Colonial Mutual has decided to merge all of its property funds into one large listed trust. Bankers Trust has also decided to list its property trust. The other financial institutions which have a significant presence in the unlisted property trust market are Advance, AMP, ANZ, National Mutual and Westpac. They have not yet announced their strategies for restructuring, but this report indicates that it is likely they will follow Colonial Mutual's decision to list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is unfortunate in the extreme that the freeze was necessary in the first place and also that it has taken nearly five months so far to introduce legislation by parliament rather than by press release, the Opposition supports this Bill. We express our hope that the restructuring of unlisted property trusts will proceed as expeditiously as possible and, of course, we all hope, more importantly, that the sort of economic policies included in the Fightback package, launched by the Opposition just over two weeks ago, will indeed create the sort of economic environment which will see some of these major properties filled with tenants who can pay rent and will put a bit of value back into the central city and commercial property markets. Indeed, that is the only way these unlisted property funds will return to being secure investments in which the mums and dads and investors of Australia can put their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make a few brief remarks about the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. This Bill makes amendments to the corporations law, which we passed in this place about 12 months ago. It changes the law principally in relation to Australian company numbers, which was a matter I brought before the Senate in a series of questions to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate. I think when I first started asking the questions he did not know what I was talking about, but he found out fairly soon thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian company number was a requirement of the initial legislation but the Government, in its great wisdom and after a lot of pressure from me and from business people all around Australia, realised that a moratorium was necessary. This time last year it introduced such a moratorium, initially for six months, and it extended it for another six months. So the moratorium on the ACN was, indeed, for 12 months and it comes to an end at the end of this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that has come from corporations, companies and small businesses around Australia has led to some of these very sensible amendments. For example, the corporations law currently provides that the ACN must appear on all business letters, accounts, invoices, receipts and orders. As I have said, at the time this legislation was passed, the Opposition expressed some concerns which have been abided by and the legislation has been amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of these amendments, companies will no longer be obliged to display their ACN on cash register receipts. We welcome that amendment. The abbreviation `ACN' will no longer require full stops; instead of `A.C.N.', we will be able to write `ACN', which will save a lot of printing costs. Pursuant to the redefinition of the term `public document', companies will not be obliged to display the ACN on their advertising or promotional material. This was a matter of great concern to the real estate industry, amongst others, which would have had to place the ACN at the bottom of every little advertisement in Saturday's metropolitan newspapers and thus added on millions of dollars in costs for the already hard-pressed real estate agents who are doing their best to survive in this very depressed market. The companies will be required to display the ACN only on documents signed or issued in the course of, or for the purposes of, a particular transaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition particularly welcomes these amendments in relation to Australian company numbers because we have been pointing out since the corporations legislation was introduced that it was simply unreasonable to expect businesses to comply with the requirement to display the ACN on all business letters, statements of account, invoices, receipts, orders for goods, official notices or publications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various technical amendments in relation to the vitally important area of fundraising. The purpose of these amendments is to remove some uncertainties in the corporations law which have become apparent over the months since the law came into operation. They make it clear that fundraising provisions do not apply to the trading of securities on the stock exchange. They also clarify how the prospectus provisions apply to other secondary trading. The amendments also provide for a defence to civil action from an omission from a prospectus, where reasonable inquiries led to a reasonable belief that there was no material omission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments enable the ASC to declare certain products to be marketable securities in order to facilitate trading of these products. The amendments also provide for a fixed date settlement regime for transactions on the Australian Stock Exchange. The standard settlement period will be five days after the trade. This amendment accords with international standards approved by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions and is intended to improve the international competitiveness of the Australian Stock Exchange by reducing delays and therefore the risks and costs involved in the settlement and clearing process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to the amendments in this Bill, the national guarantee fund will cover facilities which have been developed by the stock exchange to assist traders to comply with the new settlement requirements. This Bill is part&mdash;so the Attorney-General informs us&mdash;of an ongoing program of corporate law reform. The Opposition supports this Bill, as it welcomes any improvements in our corporate law which protect investors and creditors and, at the same time, facilitate competition and efficiency in our own domestic financial arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This specific issue, which is to do with the general matter of points of order, arose out of an exchange between my colleague Senator O'Chee and, at one stage, the Chairman.

<PARA>Whatever that might mean. The question, of course, is what time, because when you were in the chair at the previous time Senator O'Chee sought to take the point of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that is the way in which the Chair should deal with individual senators. The issue left us with a rather sour taste after the events of the other day. We very reasonably expected an explanation as to why such expressions were made in relation to an honourable senator, but we did not get that in your statement, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Depending on what might be the explanation for this course of conduct by the Chair, there are further actions that we may or may not wish to take. With regard to that first issue, therefore, I would respectfully suggest that the best way in which progress can be made would be for you to be prepared to take that away and give us a considered explanation as to why the Chairman responded to my colleague in such terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of issues arises out of the substantial part of your statement which you have put down. You said earlier in the day that you do not wish that statement to be interpreted as a presidential ruling but rather as an explanation for your series of rulings on that day. On reflection, I accept that, Mr President. I think it could be argued either way but that is the way in which you have sought to handle the matter&mdash;to give an explanation for the decisions you made the other day rather than to provide decisions by this document. Of course, if that is your explanation, it does not attract the stature that, according to the precedents, a ruling of the President attracts; it simply explains why you reached those conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Mr President, as I indicated earlier, we are unhappy with a number of rulings that you made the other day. Your explanation gives us further reason for concern. I mentioned two matters earlier in the day. There are still outstanding issues in relation to the first of these items, that relating to contingent notices of motion. For example, I am not sure whether Senator Harradine's right to use a contingent notice of motion should be lost to him as a result of my moving a motion in similar terms or using the same type of contingent motion to move a motion in different terms. That is an issue. The use of these contingent notices of motion on multiple occasions within the one debate is an issue that should be referred to the Procedure Committee. That Committee can consider it, report back here, there can be an appropriate debate and, if the Standing Orders need to be changed, they can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point in the ruling by you, concerning the Chairman's ruling&mdash;as to whether we are entitled to debate the issue under standing order 145&mdash;should also be referred to the Procedure Committee. As I said, I would argue that, after the expiration of time under that particular standing order when you moved to the voting process, the guillotine had been completed. I do not see any argument that convinces me that the Standing Orders should not be paramount and that there should not be debate in terms of standing order 145. I am not even sure that before the guillotine has been completed the right to debate&mdash;as you may have said in this statement; the option of debate or some similar expression&mdash;is lost. That issue is one that should be referred to the Procedure Committee and dealt with in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question on points of order should be dealt with similarly. As I said earlier, I believe, particularly after the guillotine is completed but even at any time, the standing order that gives honourable senators the right to rise at any time to take a point of order is paramount and should be respected. They have a right to ensure that debate is within the terms of the Standing Orders, and they have a right to stand and put that case. As you doubt that in the terms of your advice to us today, that matter should similarly be referred for further consideration and be brought back here at an appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, in regard to the substantive matters in your paper, I think your recommended procedure of taking the matters to the Procedure Committee is right. I would just add one caveat in relation to the last option, that dealing with the right to take a point of order. As I recall the events of the other day, I objected to the fact that you and the Chairman were not taking those points of order and you said that you would take the matter away and consider it. Bringing it back today and saying that this is an opinion and not a ruling has, in effect, taken from me my right to dissent, which I think is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not making any point other than, hopefully, we might all gain from this experience. It really means that the other day I should have said, `Mr President, notwithstanding that you will take it away and give it some consideration, you have made a ruling and we dissent from it'. We should have taken that action there and then. Obviously we would not want to do that within the spirit of your saying that you would take the matter away and consider it. I just put that on the table because I think it is an unsatisfactory aspect of the matter, but I do not press it any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item in this package is the decision you have made in relation to the words used by Senator Gareth Evans when he referred to the Senate as a relatively useless institution. It seems to me that that is a ruling by you because you did not make it a decision on that occasion. You said you would take it away and would come back with a position on it. Your considered decision was that to refer to the Senate as a relatively useless institution is not to use words that are offensive against this House. We on this side of the chamber disagree with your interpretation in that regard and, therefore, during this debate we will move dissent from your ruling on that particular question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the matter might be dealt with in that way. I put it constructively as a sensible way in which to deal with the three issues that are before us: first, the issue that we say is still outstanding; second, the issues that you have raised by means of your statement today, which we accept to be reasons justifying your decisions of the other day; and, third, what I think on any interpretation must be accepted as a ruling by you from which we have a right to dissent and from which we will dissent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not distracted. I find it fascinating. Mr President, I notice that you, very sensibly and with persuasion to buttress your arguments, used the words of Odgers when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a practice of the Senate, when a decision of the Chairman of Committees is objected to, to permit Senators to address themselves to the question before the President gives a decision.</PARA>
<PARA>This, like everything Odgers writes, is eminently sensible and eminently practical. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The debate on an objection to a decision of the Chairman cannot be adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA>Odgers is telling us that it is obligatory to allow debate to take place prior to your ruling, not that we are not entitled to, which, with respect, is the view you held at the time. Mr President, on page 6 you say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be argued that the President is under an obligation to do so when there is an order of the Senate that a bill must be dealt with within a limited time.</PARA>
<PARA>With the greatest respect, there is a temptation to say that that has a faint whiff of explanation and justification, rather than buttressing your argument. I support Senator Hill when he says that debate should have taken place at that time. That is a view which was also put by Senator Ray and Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you raised the matter of the constraints that the guillotine has on the exercise of Standing Orders. You referred to it particularly with respect to the contingent notice of motion and points of order. It is my view that, while the Standing Orders are silent on the matter, a practical application of common sense would hold that you would be debasing the intention of the Standing Orders and the intention of the guillotine if you were to allow a liberal interpretation of the contingent notices of motion to the point where they could totally frustrate the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is then argued whether Senator Hill has the right to move the only contingent notice of motion, or whether Senator Harradine and the Labor Party have the right to move  contingent notices of motion. That begs the question as to what part the political parties have in the chamber in terms of their rights. I hold that that was never considered at the time that the Standing Orders were written, rather, the Standing Orders were intended for each individual senator and so it is sensible that we only have the right of one contingent notice of motion. There is no practical way that that could be compromised by suggesting that each political party ought to be able to have a shot. It is my view that once a contingent notice of motion has been moved, that is the only one. Mr President, you also refer to the ruling with respect to giving notice of motions of similar words inside six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to points of order, it is a compelling argument that, once you have heard sufficient debate on the subject of a point of order, you are entitled to say that you have made up your mind and you need no further assistance from the Senate. That is always a fine point because you do not know what enlightened view will be proffered to you which might be compelling in a way which would have you change your mind. In terms of the practical application, it is sensible that the President says, `I have heard enough to be satisfied that I am in a position to make a determination'. If someone stands up and says, `I have a different point of view', that is in breach of Standing Orders because you have to dispose of each matter as it comes before you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite wrong, in my view, to suggest in any way that the guillotine inhibits the right of any senator at any time to take a point of order. I am certain it was never intended that the guillotine would prevent the ordinary functioning and exercising of rights by any senator. It requires certain motions to be put immediately and it does talks in terms of taking precedent over all other procedures, but it certainly was not intended to deny the right of senators to draw the President's attention to certain matters in the chamber, for instance, a quorum. Are we suggesting that we are unable to call a quorum because of the guillotine? That does not make sense to me. It would be quite wrong to suggest that the guillotine is that inhibiting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, some people in this Opposition just want to interrupt all the time and not get down to a serious discussion on these issues. As I was saying, there is a small dichotomy between what is literally in the Standing Orders and what has been ruled in the past, and that is what you have tried to resolve here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several points have been raised. Senator Hill first of all raised a point of order concerning Senator O'Chee. My understanding is that Senator O'Chee tried to get the call at the end of the division. The President, who was only in the chair to sit in on that division, was then required to leave the chair immediately. That is a fact. There is a subsequent argument as to whether Senator Colston should have recognised Senator O'Chee. That is a separate issue and I will come back to it in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill had a contingent notice of motion that he could move and you, Mr President, ruled that only one such contingent notice of motion could be moved. That is a good ruling but it does have implications. It is a good ruling because if you did not rule that way, every single person around the chamber could put up a contingent notice of motion and frustrate anything. It comes back to who the Chair recognises and whether we have to put up contingent notices of motion to kill off contingent notices of motion. Then we get into a contingent notice of motion escalation that none of us can control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at the same time, what is to say that when Senator Hill gets in first, that is fair on anyone else who has a contingent notice of motion that may go along another line? That is the difficulty we are going to have to confront. We must try, through commonsense, to work out what is fair and that applies to everyone well and truly now and into the future, so that it does not matter what side of this chamber we are on, there will be some fairness into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that Senator Hill raised is this question of debate under standing order 145. I come down in the middle a bit on this. I think a literal reading of the Standing Orders suggests that when the Chairman's ruling is dissented from, the President shall take the chair and he can&mdash;maybe he is impelled to by that Standing Order&mdash;listen to arguments on it. At the same time, if the first two precepts I have mentioned&mdash;no goodwill and no commonsense&mdash;have been shown, it is up to any government or any majority in this place immediately to gag the debate if they think it is just a delaying tactic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will not always be a delaying tactic. Sometimes the Chairman's ruling will be dissented from for very serious reasons and we will need to have a debate in this place before the President makes a final ruling. It is also possible that many of us could have drawn the conclusion that that three-hour shamble, that display of anarchistic elan that this institution showed, was deliberately engineered out of spite because we had a guillotine going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the first time this has happened. When I looked back through the records to see which of those opposite have voted for guillotines, I noted some of the dissent at the time from the Labor Party. It was pretty virulent stuff from Senator Georges and Senator Walsh, and they adopted similar sorts of tactics to disrupt and try to destroy. The only difference was that the other side had the numbers to gag at that stage, as well as guillotine, and ruthlessly did so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go into the question of whether standing order 145 should be debated or not, a lot comes from peoples' motives for moving it. A literal reading suggests to me that debate may occur and I am not sure whether the President has discretion on it or not. Mr President, I can understand your ruling one way or the other on this particular issue. That should be sorted out, because dissent from a Chairman's ruling has a different effect from dissent from a President's ruling because standing order 198 has different provisions in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Mr President, it is certainly open to you to be addressed on the subject, then to make a ruling and then to trigger standing order 198. There is no question that you are able to do that under that standing order. The question is whether you have discretion to rule out debate in the first place. In the end, the discretion did not lie with you, Mr President, because the Manager of Government Business (Senator McMullan) decided to take the events forward&mdash;and then abbreviate them very much, but at least we resolved them in that particular way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill raises a third point about the paramount right of honourable senators to take a point of order. This is something I cannot challenge; I always assumed it was thus. But there is another responsibility that goes with this.

I suspect that a lot of people who, expecting to watch Question Time, saw the anarchistic effort that this Parliament House put on out of pure spite on that occasion&mdash;and then it got worse and worse&mdash;might come to the same judgment if those opposite are not very careful because it was not a very edifying spectacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that any Opposition or any group of individual senators can reduce this place to nothing by the misuse and abuse of the Standing Orders.

But because the atmosphere was fairly poisoned anyway as a result of the guillotine, extraordinary efforts were taken on that day to go through that sort of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crichton-Browne raised a few points. He acknowledged the problem that contingent notices of motion potentially can have, and I agree with that. He said that every point of order should be dealt with. Of course, I agree with that. He and others have said that this should go to the Standing Committee on Procedure. Here I do have my doubts, I am sorry to say. I have been on the Procedure Committee&mdash;maybe this is the problem&mdash;since July 1981 or thereabouts. I think the Procedure Committee&mdash;how can I kindly put it?&mdash;has not been the most productive committee in that 10 years. It is sometimes regarded as a sort of fantasy object. When we cannot agree in this chamber, we say, `Let us refer it to the Procedure Committee'. Out it goes to the Procedure Committee, half the time never to reappear again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty with that Committee&mdash;and I have to acknowledge that there are difficulties&mdash;is that many of the people on it are busy people. It has been hard to get common meeting times. We have tried dinner break meetings but there always seems to be problems, including food poisoning at times. We have tried to meet during sitting hours. That is not always possible because various people have appointments. Every decision has to be unanimous, and I must say that I agree with that; I think that is the sensible way to approach it, although occasionally we have even agreed to put in conflicting views and have them resolved in the chamber. But we should not hold our breath in the expectation that the Procedure Committee can solve all these problems, because some of them, such as contingent notices of motion, are almost not `soughtoutable'. Something that is practical and something that is fair are well and truly apart. </PARA>

Six months after the bottom of the harbour legislation they all had a conscience and opposed retrospective legislation. But when their seats were on the line, apart from two or three, most of them voted for it. Two or three did not but the rest did. Then a few months later all of them said, `It is a matter of great principle and we cannot do this particular thing'.

There was no such inference in what I said and Senator Bishop is very over-sensitive if she reads that into my remarks. I was about to sum up and conclude, if I can do so without too much interruption. The issues raised in Mr President's statement are important. The question of contingent notices of motion will be difficult to resolve simply because it involves two principles, both of which have merit. On the question of debate on standing order 145, it is clear that debate can be entertained provided the chamber is so disposed. If the chamber is disposed to gag the matter, it may do so, as it did last week. If Opposition senators wait until the end of the sentence instead of trying to interrupt, they would understand the meaning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is on the question of entertaining points of order. That should be done, I think, at all times, but it has another side of the coin, that they should be genuine points of order. Points of order with no substance&mdash;just argumentative points of order, meant to interrupt debate&mdash;should be dealt with seriously by the Chair. The final point is that if the sensitive souls opposite who object to the comments of Senator Evans cannot stand the heat in the kitchen they should pop outside. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter spoke and made a characteristic contribution to the debate. I go back to the time when I was a student: the line of argument he was using was always described in those days as `situation ethics'. That related to someone who had no morality but just judged the circumstances at the time according to the way that events impacted upon him or her. There was no right or wrong; it just depended on how it affected one at the time. One derived his or her own moral standards from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support what Senator Hill and Senator Crichton-Browne have said. I would like to pick up the approach of Senator Robert Ray. I agree with much of what he said. We need to apply a little bit of commonsense to this matter. The first thing in relation to commonsense is that the Senate is master of its own destiny. We can make up the rules of debate and procedures as it suits us. We look to precedent only as a guide. There is certainly no obligation on the Senate to follow precedents all the time because we are not a court of law and we do not have to be bound by previous rulings that have been made by Presidents in times gone by when the numbers and the circumstances of the Senate were really quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular point of difference I have with your statement, with the greatest respect, Mr President, relates to standing order 145. Standing order 145 says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . before the President, and Senators having addressed themselves to it . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike Senator Ray, I do believe that part is obligatory;  that no other interpretation can be accepted other than that there has to be debate by senators, if they wish to address the matter which led to the removal of the Chairman from chairing the Committee of the Whole. With the greatest respect, I do not believe that was done in the way the standing order is written and implies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I refer to contingency motions. In my judgment, the Standing Orders do not mean that only one contingency motion can be moved when a Bill has been declared urgent. Again, as Senator Ray said, the conduct of the chamber can be taken out by a wilful senator from the majority view, whether that be the Government or the Opposition. I think there has to be a degree of judgment as to whether someone is moving in a way to disrupt the intention of the majority of senators or whether someone is using the calling on of a contingency motion to deny the legitimate use of it in a later part of the debate. I recognise that that is a very difficult proposition to resolve. We certainly will not resolve it here tonight; it is a matter for endless hours in the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I refer to points of order. I do not believe that points of order can be denied. The right to raise points of order is a fundamental right of debate. I do not find it a valid interpretation of standing order 142 that there is a prohibition when urgency has been declared. I recognise, of course, the right of the Chair to cut short points of order if they are repetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming to the whole area of vexatious points of order, there is no doubt in my mind that standing order 203 gives the Chair the absolute power to control the use of frivolous, vexatious or destructive points of order. There is no question in my mind that if senators persistently and wilfully obstruct the business of the Senate by moving irrelevant, fictitious or foolish points of order they ought to be named and removed by the President or whoever is in the chair. I think that remedies exist in the Standing Orders at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What upset honourable senators on this side of the chamber more than anything else was the fact that certain senators stood and were denied the call during the period in dispute which led to your paper having to be written. As I said earlier, I believe that the Chair has the right to cut short points of order. If an appeal has been made and the President has made up his mind that there is not a valid point of order, he has the right to deny other senators from debating the same point of order. But it has always been a matter of courtesy and custom for the Chair to ask the senator, `Do you have the same point of order?'. That means that senators are recognised and have an opportunity, very briefly, to say why they are on their feet. If that is not done, this chamber becomes absolutely unworkable. If a senator rises in his or her place, is not recognised and is completely ignored, we simply cannot operate. That is the real heart of the matter. That is why we are discussing this tonight&mdash;honourable senators rose and were not called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I do not want to spend much time talking about Senator Ray's defence of Senator Evans's position that the Senate is not a respectable and responsible chamber. I found it absolutely astonishing that Senator Ray could protest about the Liberal Party trying to have a majority in the Senate and implying, at the same time, that the Labor Party went into elections without the will to win and win a majority in the Senate. That is absolute nonsense and humbug. I can remember a time in the mid-1940s when the Labor Party held 32 out of 36 Senate positions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I think you should be congratulated on the statement you have made. I will make some points about it. First, I refer to what Senator MacGibbon said. I agree with him entirely that the Senate is master of its own destiny. That is absolutely true. I do not think anyone would seriously argue with that proposition. On the night that standing order 145 came before us, it was dealt with by a motion from Senator McMullan. There has been considerable criticism of what he did; that is, he moved that the question now be put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the Parliamentary Secretary had moved that the question be put, the Senate did become a master of its own destiny and decided by a majority that the question be put and that there be no more argument, under standing order 145. Had that question not been put, I agree that under standing order 145 honourable senators would have had an opportunity to address themselves to the issue. Once the closure has been moved, that is overridden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of points of order arises under chapter 31 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senate Standing Orders and Other Orders of the Senate</EMPHASIS>. The overriding rule in that chapter is standing order 184(1), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Order shall be maintained in the Senate by the President.</PARA>
<PARA>Your overriding duty, Mr President, is to maintain order. There is a series of orders setting out how you might do that. One of those concerns raising a point of order. A point of order is a point raised legitimately by a senator to help you maintain order in this House. I do not want to refer to any particular point of order that may have been raised over the last few weeks, but a point of order is a procedure which should be a shield for the way that this Senate is conducted. It should be a shield for the proper running of this place. It should be a shield for our privileges. When it is used as an offensive weapon so that it becomes a means of disrupting procedure for whatever motive, whether it be a good motive or not&mdash;if it becomes a procedure for obtaining a political or personal advantage or any other sort of advantage&mdash;then it very much becomes an issue as to whether it has been legitimately used and whether the order that it arises from, order 197, is overridden by the provisions of order 184. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another point I wish to raise about order 197. Subsection (5) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President may hear argument on the question, and may determine it forthwith, or at a later time, at the President's discretion.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no obligation on you, Mr President, to hear argument. You should not use that order as a means of dismissing any argument, but it is in your judgment that the order of this chamber rests. If you make a judgment, it is incumbent upon the Senate to accept that or to take the proceedings which are set out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Standing Orders and Other Orders</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 2 is a very significant chapter. It sets out how a President is to be elected, how a ballot is to be conducted and how Presidents should conduct themselves. I have a feeling that the chamber as a whole&mdash;I do not pick out any side of the chamber&mdash;has not given you, Mr President, the support that you are entitled to and which is contemplated by these Standing and Other Orders in recent times. The Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Thursday, 5 December 1991, particularly from page 4238 on, is hardly an edifying record of what happened on that occasion. We have a heavy responsibility, not only to this chamber and our parties but also to the electorate as a whole. As senators, and politicians generally, we do not do ourselves justice in terms of our parties or the system in the way we sometimes act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is my proposition that you have prepared a document which should form the basis for an improvement in the way we have conducted ourselves here. The matters that you have sent to the Procedure Committee should be treated seriously, but overall the matter comes back to whether or not we as a Senate are willing to accept not only the letter but also the spirit of chapter 31 to give the President the proper help that he deserves and to go on from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last issue in that context is the question of contingent notices of motion. I think they are a very legitimate procedure, but again the order of the Senate cannot be helped if a whole array of contingency motions can be passed one after another. That would not help the proper running of the Senate which, after all, is the responsibility of us all and the responsibility of you in particular, Mr President, and because it is your particular responsibility you need help from this chamber. </PARA>

This brings me, therefore, to a very important point, one raised by Senator Colston this evening.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Labor senators jeered at me. It was well known in this chamber that I was attempting to raise a point of order. On numerous occasions other points of order were raised by other colleagues, but at no time did I have the opportunity to put this particular point of order in relation to Senator Evans's conduct. That does not mean that I was not intent on raising the point of order and that certainly does not mean that I was not on my feet attempting to do so. The fact that I was not standing here screaming at the top of my voice is the reason why it was not recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. For the good conduct of this chamber I was patient and observed the Standing Orders and rose in my place. It was only out of frustration, having failed to get the call to raise a point of order before a division, that I attempted to raise a point of order, recorded at page 4246, when I called to you:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That created the problem, as Senator Baume said, because then Senator Teague again tried to raise this point of order and the Chairman would not recognise him. In fact, Senator Teague tried on three occasions and eventually the Chairman said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we have spurious points of order, I will deal with the senators concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>But he did not take the point of order; in fact, he ignored Senator Teague. That started an exchange with Senator Baume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 4247 shows that Senator Alston rose to raise, I assume, the same point of order. We will never know, because Senator Colston did not take the point of order. The exchange that went on is interesting. Senator Alston got up and said, `Pursuant to standing order&mdash;', and he was cut off by the Chairman who said, `Order! You do not have the call'. Senator Alston said, `Well, I am seeking the call'. The Chairman said, `Senator Alston, you do not have the call'. Senator Alston said, `Mr Chairman!', and Senator Colston replied, `I am putting the question that the remaining amendments circulated by the Government be agreed to'. With Senator Alston still protesting, the matter went to a vote. Immediately after the vote, Senator Colston vacated the chair with at least three Opposition senators still on their feet trying to raise this point of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very clearly, not only I, but also many of my colleagues on this side of the chamber, did everything in our power to ensure that the dignity of this Senate was preserved, yet we were thwarted and frustrated. That is a matter of grave concern to me. I suppose the defence that Senator Colston must now rely upon is the fact that the Committee was operating under a guillotine. But the guillotine, as laid down in standing order 142, does not preclude the taking of points of order and, indeed, never has. Nor does the guillotine preclude a procedural motion being put. Rather, it says that certain questions shall be put forthwith. It does not say, `immediately and to the exclusion of all other matters before the chamber'. It is interesting to see exactly what it does say. Standing order 142(4) says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purpose of bringing to a conclusion any proceedings which are to be brought to a conclusion on the expiration of the time allotted under any motion passed under the provisions of this standing order, the President or the Chairman shall at the time appointed put forthwith the question on any amendment. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to list a number of matters. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and any other question requisite to dispose of the business before the Senate or committee, and no other amendments, new clauses or schedules shall be proposed.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear from the wording of that paragraph of standing order 142 that it does not preclude the taking of points of order, nor does it preclude the moving of a procedural motion which relates to the disposal of the business before the Senate. In fact, it only specifically precludes three types of motions being put: motions relating to amendments, new clauses or schedules. They are the only things that cannot be put at that stage. Clearly, one can rise on a point of order and, clearly, one can move a procedural motion. That applies whether the Senate is in the Committee of the Whole or is sitting as the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best exposition of this comes from something which occurred on 14 September 1972. This is interesting. The wording of standing order 142(1) in relation to a matter being declared urgent is almost the same as the putting of a Bill or clauses upon the guillotine falling. Standing order 142(1) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a Minister may declare that a bill is an urgent bill, and move that the bill be considered an urgent bill, and such motion shall be put forthwith without debate or amendment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is almost identical wording. The important thing is that the motion be put forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 September 1972, a motion was moved by Senator Greenwood that a particular Bill be considered urgent. A number of points of order followed and there was an objection to the ruling of the President. There was a full debate on that. Half an hour or three-quarters of an hour later, the matter was finally resolved and the Senate proceeded with the Bill. Clearly, the same provision in standing order 142(1) applies to standing order 142(4). It is unsatisfactory to say that just because there is a guillotine there can be no further points of order and no procedural matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by discussing the matter of contingent notices of motion. It has been argued that it is not possible to move a second contingent notice of motion in this chamber when a guillotine has fallen on a Bill, a first contingent notice of motion having been used. I assume that is based upon the proposition that the same question is not to be proposed twice. But there is a difference between one contingent notice of motion and another. Certainly a contingent notice of motion may replicate a previous one in moving a procedural motion relating to a Bill which is substantially the same as the previous procedural motion, and it would be improper to have that considered again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, upon the falling of the guillotine, it would be improper to first move that the time allotted be extended for 10 minutes and then use a contingent notice of motion to move that the time allotted be extended for 15 minutes, the first contingent notice of motion having failed. Indeed, if it is something like that, it is appropriate that the contingent notice of motion be amended. But it is a completely different matter to say, if a motion has been moved that the time allotted for consideration of a Bill be extended for 10 minutes and that has been concluded and resolved in the negative, that it is not proper to say that honourable senators are precluded from moving pursuant to a contingent notice of motion that the Bill be referred to a committee. That is a completely different matter. It is substantially different. I think that should weigh in your mind, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, on this side of the chamber, there is no satisfaction with the handling of the points of order nor, indeed, is there any satisfaction with Senator Evans's remarks which not only are contrary to standing order 193(3) but also are a contempt of the Senate and should be dealt with at least by Senator Evans's withdrawal, if not by further measures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief as there are only two areas I want to speak to. I am sure Senator Cooney has missed the point we were making. On taking points of order, Senator Cooney referred to standing order 197(2) which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Senator may draw attention at any time to a point of order or a matter of privilege arising in the proceedings then before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Then Senator Cooney referred to standing order 197(5) which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President may hear argument on the question, and may determine it forthwith, or at a later time, at the President's discretion.</PARA>
<PARA>We have no argument about that at all. The point we are making on this side of the House is that the Chair at no stage recognised the senator on his feet. I have only to turn to page 4246 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> when Senator Teague was attempting valiantly to take a point of order to illustrate this. At the time Senator Colston was in the Chair and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Order! The Committee will come to order.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague, who was on his feet, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Chairman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman ignored him completely and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time for consideration of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill has now expired&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Chairman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question is that the remaining amendments circulated by the Government be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>He completely ignored Senator Teague, who was on his feet. Senator Teague said again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Chairman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Order! I intend to do what the Senate and the Committee require me to do and that is to put the questions that are before us.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague said again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Chairman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we have spurious points of order, I will deal with the senators concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>At no stage did the Chairman call Senator Teague by name or refer to him or acknowledge the fact that he was on his feet. The Senate cannot work in that fashion. Every senator in this place has certain rights. I agree with Senator Cooney that it is a matter on which the President can make a decision and say, `I do not want to hear any more points of order', but at least he says, `Senator Teague, I have made a decision, I do not want to hear any more points of order'. He does not ignore Senator Teague's existence while he is on his feet. That is the point that we on this side of the chamber have been attempting to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second minor point that I would like to mention concerns standing order 145. Senator Ray, in his speech tonight, deliberately misread the standing order, which says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The matter having been laid before the President, and Senators having addressed themselves to it. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Not `may', as Senator Ray said, but very definitely an obligation. That is another area where we disagree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray adopts a supposedly laid back, `you know, we all do this sort of thing' attitude. But this side of the chamber has totally different party rules from the Government. Let me make it perfectly clear: I have crossed the floor four times in my career and never once have I been reprimanded in any way. My selection was never, at any time, threatened. The only person from the other side of the chamber whom I have ever seen cross the floor was Senator Georges. He was thrown out because he dared to have the courage to do what has been done on this side of the chamber so many times. One of my colleagues from Tasmania, former Senator Wright, must have crossed the floor on 50 occasions; at no stage was his selection ever threatened and at no stage was he ever reprimanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be recognised, not only by the Labor Party but also by the Democrats, that we behave totally differently from the way they do. The Democrats are a fairly new party; I do not think any of them were here when we were in government. They do not have a clue about how we behaved when we were in government. We never behaved like lap-dogs to the Ministers as we see back bench Labor members performing today. When we were in government, no Minister ever dared to hand us dorothy dix questions. We would not have accepted them; we would have considered them an insult. But we have never heard anything else in Question Time from the Government back bench&mdash;nothing is ever put up by backbenchers that is original and might be a bit tricky for Ministers. Dorothy dixers are all we ever get. Now is not the time to expand further on what Senator Ray tried to get across. He was just so totally wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, there are only three points that I wish to make this evening. I will be brief, as my colleagues have been, because I think the points have been well made by other speakers. The first matter I wish to address is whether a senator seeking the call to raise a point of order should at least get the call. I agree with many other speakers who have said that you, Mr President, or whoever is in the chair at the time, have the right, if not the obligation, in order to conduct the place properly, to alert the chamber to the fact that you have made a decision and you regard yourself as needing no further assistance in that respect. At that time, I think it is fair enough to call the chamber to order and say that you are ready to rule on the point of order and do not need further assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that, after that time, a senator seeking the call on that point of order may have to miss out, and in fact should miss out if you have had all the assistance you need. Of course, that is not the point that has been raised by the failure to call Senator O'Chee, which could easily have been raised as the failure to call me or a number of other people who were raising a point of order on that day. It is quite a separate matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall, anyway, none of these refusals to see a senator standing and calling a point of order related to a continuing commentary on a point of order that had already been raised but rather to the desire to raise a point of order. I would have been interested to hear what Senator Colston or you, Mr President, might have had to say. I do not recall who it was and I think sometimes the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> just records `Mr President' if either one of you is in the chair, though I am not sure. In any event, I wished to raise a point of order and was told to sit down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that I have never raised a point of order that could not properly be described as one. But I do say that people could hardly characterise me as someone who frequently raises improper points of order in order to disrupt this chamber. That would be one of the last descriptions which could be applied to me. Other descriptions of a much less attractive and more insulting nature than that could be applied, but that one would be unfair. I am therefore at a loss to understand why, when I stood on my feet to raise a point of order, I was told to sit down without even getting the opportunity to say what the point of order was. This did not happen only to me; it happened to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this is that it does not matter where we are in the debate&mdash;whether we have a guillotine or a gag or whatever&mdash;if proceedings are not being conducted properly, any senator should have not only a right but also an obligation to bring the impropriety in the proceedings to your attention, Mr President, by using the Standing Orders. Whether we are acting under a gag or a guillotine&mdash;it does not matter what we are doing&mdash;we have to do it by virtue of the Standing Orders. That one standing order allowing a senator to stand in his or her place and raise a point of order actually gives the person in the chair a right of access, if you like, to the views of all the senators in the chamber and alerts the Chair to when something may not be in accordance with the Standing Orders. For that reason, it is a very dangerous precedent to just barge through proceedings and not give the call to a senator who has sought it&mdash;ab initio, if you like&mdash;to raise a point of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as to the right to speak when a Chairman's ruling has been disagreed with, a number of speakers have made the point that the standing order indicates that, when the matter has been addressed by senators, the President can make a ruling. Mr President, I understand that you were advised or had decided that you could come in, you could make a ruling and then any dissent from your ruling would be dealt with under the other standing order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the greatest respect, I disagree with that as the appropriate course of action. I think the reason for there being two separate standing orders is so that a disagreement with your rulings can be dealt with under one and a disagreement with the Chairman's rulings can be dealt with under the other. The standing order dealing with the Chairman's rulings makes it quite clear that there is an expectation that debate will take place. Senator Cooney, quite wisely, I think, says he agrees with that proposal. But, he says, Senator McMullan saved us from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two things I want to say about that. Firstly, Senator McMullan in a sense saved us&mdash;or you, Mr President&mdash;from being in the position of having gone down that path of not having allowed debate. He did that by inferring&mdash;and I do not think I am doing him a disservice here&mdash;that he understood the desire for debate and he understood the desire to deal with the issue under the relevant standing order. The inference was that it was so that debate could take place. I do not think I am alone in coming to that conclusion. It was because of his having created that inference that leave was granted for him to move the relevant motion that he did. Having moved it, he then, appropriately, moved the gag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one will not now agree to do anything Senator McMullan wants, unless the detail of what will happen following that, and following that, and following that, is spelt out so that we know exactly where we are going. I took his actions to be as close to deceptive to the chamber as we can get. As I say, he gave the inference that debate would take place and then immediately moved the gag. That means that in future, when he gives an inference that one course will be followed, there will need to be serious questioning before any leave is given to do what he wants to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all I have to say in relation to the right to speak&mdash;namely, that I am quite convinced that, under the standing order, the right to speak should be given. Secondly, I say to my colleague Senator Cooney that, whether or not he regards what Senator McMullan did as a save, I certainly do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I want to raise is that of contingent notices of motion. I see that there is some difficulty there. It is quite clear that if the Senate has set itself some time limit, we do not want the question of that time limit being recommitted and recommitted. But I also understand that if Senator Harradine were to move a contingent notice of motion in his name, that would then deprive people on this side of the chamber&mdash;Senator Hill or whoever&mdash;of the opportunity of raising that contingent notice of motion. So that is a problem which needs to be addressed by the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect the answer is that if the contingent notice of motion seeks some extension and someone wants to move almost the same question, then he or she should be deprived of the right to do that because all that person wants to do is recommit the question again and again. But that is perhaps a matter for longer consideration on another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, I want to direct some remarks to Senator Evans who, the chamber is told by some of his colleagues, when he made his remark was of a certain temperament and so we should not be too upset about it. But I think it is a disgraceful exercise to refer to the chamber in which one is employed as being `a relatively useless institution'. If Senator Evans thinks this is a useless institution he must, by implication, think the House of Representatives is where all the sensible people are. It must be sad for him to have it as a matter of public record that he tried to get into that place, where the more useful people are considered to be, in his mind, and was rejected. I am referring of course to Senator Evans's attempts to be the member for Jagajaga&mdash;a seat now held by Mr Staples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remark also flies in the face of Senator Evans's answers to questions this afternoon. When giving an explanation of why there are so many Victorians in the inner Cabinet of this Government to the exclusion of proper representation of other States, he indicated that cream always rises to the top&mdash;clearly meaning that he sees himself as being at the superior end of the Labor Party talent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that when we sit here in Question Time; we can see the disdain in which he holds some of the poor suckers on the other side who are given the task of coming up with dorothy dixers. He clearly does see himself as being way above the intellectual capacity and standing of anyone else on that side. It must be an enormous strain for him therefore to be placed in this chamber which he sees as being `relatively useless'. But not only that; it must be a strain for him to realise that not only has he not got what he wants but also that his Party has been so silly as to put such an intelligent person in what he regards as such a relatively useless place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I want to make a couple of points with regard to your statement entitled `Statement by Mr President'. I do not know whether you claim authorship of it as well, but I think a couple of points need to be made, particularly with regard to page 5, `Ruling by the President on the Chairman's Ruling'. The statement sets out standing order 145 and the stages that have to be gone through. It states that when the objection is taken it has to be in writing. That occurred. The standing order continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chairman shall then leave the Chair, and the Senate resume.</PARA>
<PARA>That was when you came back into the chair, Mr President. I continue:</PARA>

<PARA>So we go back to the Chairman. The reason it is important to go through the rest of what is on page 5 is that I can see we are likely to get into this situation again. That is an unfortunate thing to have to say, but from the way that rulings are being made in this chamber now and the way that Standing Orders are being paid so little heed I really think we have to put on the record our solid objection to the way this argument runs so that when we are faced with this situation again&mdash;which, as I have said, I have no doubt we will be&mdash;we will have an argument with which to run. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference in the standing order to the matter being disposed of means disposed of by a ruling of the President, which can then be objected to under standing order 198.</PARA>
<PARA>Which of course is done without debate. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the President rules on the correctness of the Chairman's ruling. This interpretation has always been followed since the standing orders were adopted in 1903. The procedure is described in Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I will go through that and compare it with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in a moment. What is dishonest about that statement is that it fails to address that part of standing order 145 which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter having been laid before the President, and Senators having addressed themselves to it, shall be disposed of, and the proceedings. . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Mr President, I only want briefly to address one aspect&mdash;although I have strong feelings about various other aspects&mdash;and that relates to the point of order. In particular, I want to challenge the following proposition in your statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be within the discretion of the Chair to decline to hear any further points of order and to put the questions for determining the proceedings on the urgent bill. If this were not so, it would be open to individual Senators to raise successive points of order and by that means to defeat the determination by the Senate that an urgent bill must be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I object to that with great vigour is that if this situation were to prevail it would be open to senators on the Government side, for example, deliberately to breach Standing Orders with impunity. The Opposition would not be in a position to take points of order on clear breaches of the Standing Orders because the Chairman, President or whoever is occupying the chair, may have taken the view, totally opposed by the Opposition, that what was going on was acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a compliant chairman in that situation, without necessarily using it as a pejorative which is capable of all interpretations. It would be absolutely intolerable if, by this ruling, a government were to be given the power to steamroll matters in this place, denying the Opposition the right to take points of order. I find that so unacceptable that I am astounded it is seriously proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the next point. I have been a member of each House of Parliament, with total service of 14 years. Never before in my parliamentary career have I been dealt with as I was dealt with by the Chairman of Committees, Senator Colston. I have never been put in a situation where I have refused what to me was a totally improper request to withdraw a statement that was patently true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this all stemmed&mdash;despite Senator Colston's attempted explanation to skirt the issue by not quoting in full page 4241 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;from Senator Vanstone, immediately on Senator Evans's statement which she found unacceptable, very loudly saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Point of order! Point of order!</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, you then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Order!  Resume your seat, Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, at that point, if your position was that no points of order were to be entertained because of your view of the impact of the guillotine, I believe it was your duty to explain to the Opposition that you would not entertain points of order, in which case your ruling could then have been disagreed with immediately. I put it to you that when an Opposition has cause to feel aggrieved by what it perceives to be unfair treatment from the Chair the good conduct of the House is at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that situation, Mr President, I believe that, if that were your view at the time, you were in error not to put it so that we could dissent from it. To allow a situation where members of the Opposition, Senator O'Chee for example, were constantly rising and not being called&mdash;as you know, we both received telephone calls from viewers of the ABC, after those persistent attempts, saying, `You advised Senator Colston, as he took over the Chair, that if Senator O'Chee tried to take a point of order you were not in the Chair any more'&mdash;clearly indicated your awareness of the fact that you had deliberately, for whatever reasons, good or bad, not called Senator O'Chee and had not called other people who were standing. If you listen to the tape of the event, as I have, you will hear that the issue could and should have been resolved by your taking that point of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My anger&mdash;as you could see, Mr President, it was genuine anger at what was happening in this chamber&mdash;was based on the gratuitous remark made by the Chairman, Senator Colston, in denying what was a perfectly proper point of order; a point of order which you found serious enough, when you eventually had the opportunity to rule on it, to discuss at some length in your ruling which is appended to your statement. It was a matter of substance which was dismissed out of hand by Senator Colston on the basis that it should have been made at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had wall to wall points of order at that time. It was simply inappropriate and wrong for Senator Colston to gratuitously make that remark to Senator O'Chee and, by the extent of its unfairness, it incited and invited an angry response. That is not the way to conduct the proceedings of this place. I regret that my anger prompted me to refuse a request which I regarded as totally improper, and still do. I say to you, Mr President, that had you ruled appropriately at the instance of Senator Vanstone the issue would have been a different one in terms of arguing about the propriety or correctness of that decision. If the Chairman had not made that gratuitous remark, the issue would not have become as inflamed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a duty on the President and the Chairman of Committees to conduct proceedings in this place so that no side feels aggrieved. In this case, that duty was not executed in an effective and proper way. To that extent, I regret that your statement has not dealt with the issues that prompted anger, disappointment and clear unhappiness in general on this side of the chamber. We felt that we were unfairly dealt with. It is a duty of the Chairman of Committees to do what he can to ensure that that perception is not held by the Opposition. Regrettably, in my view, what passed as an explanation from Senator Colston tonight did nothing to justify his position and did nothing to explain the gratuitous nature of his remark to Senator O'Chee. On all those grounds, I would hope that the conduct of the chamber is better in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I may be wrong, but I am also concerned about the position in which Senator McMullan moved the gag. I was under the impression&mdash;it may be wrong&mdash;that Ministers can move the gag at any time, but I thought that someone who is not a Minister would have to seek leave to do so. That may not be so. That was in the back of my mind, but I may be confusing the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I acknowledge the clear point that points of order must be made at the time, it is infuriating when one is denied the right to take a point of order to then be told that it is not a point of order because it was not taken at the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some brief remarks, mostly in response to what Senator Robert Ray said, relating to the goodwill and good sense that must endure if this chamber is to conduct its affairs in the manner to which the people of Australia would expect the Federal Parliament, particularly the senior House&mdash;also known as the States House, the House of review and the Senate&mdash;to conduct its affairs. Clearly, Thursday was not a red letter day for the Senate. Senator Ray referred to it as anarchy. But it is important that the Senate not just take Senator Ray's comments without challenging them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus, on behalf of the Government, reintroduced this legislation and brought in an enormous raft of amendments, followed by amendment after amendment, when we knew that the Australian Democrats had clearly done a deal&mdash;between $2m and $5m&mdash;which would benefit that political Party. Opposition senators who had a very fundamental, principled objection to the legislation and the detail of that legislation would seek to do whatever they could to use the forms of this chamber and the opportunities the debate in this chamber presented to them to ensure that the Australian people had an opportunity to be aware of the very important issues contained in it. Of course, the Government expected that. The Government ensured that we were given a number of hours to debate the legislation, knowing full well that as long as the guillotine applied&mdash;a guillotine that it had to take off twice in a row&mdash;there would be a very heated and vitriolic debate, but still the message would not seep through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took the editorial writer of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> until today to uncover the issues. Basically, the matters were discussed in the chamber in a very heated debate. That did not seep out into the broader community. The point that Opposition senators have made time and time again is that it does not matter whether we give the chamber 30 hours, 60 hours or two weeks to debate something. Until the community can see the importance of what is being debated here and the political pressures upon senators, quite properly, it does not matter whether we have one week, two weeks or a year to debate these matters. That was what made Opposition senators very agitated, very frustrated and very angry about the way this debate was conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My comments earlier this evening in relation to the Australian Democrats, which I had to withdraw, are yet another monument to that frustration. We saw the Democrats basically selling out for the price of between $2m and $5m in benefits to their political Party. I think it is fair to say that the term I used&mdash;political prostitutes&mdash;even though it was considered at the time to be unparliamentary, did not relate to any individual; it related to the Australian Democrats. Anyone who analyses the behaviour of the Australian Democrats in relation to this legislation would have to apply that term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that Senator Ray raised was the way that points of order are being used to disrupt Question Time. Again, I think the matter of goodwill and good sense needs to be applied. Of course, when we have a government which is under extreme pressure, as is the Government at the moment&mdash;with its leadership woes and the woes of an economy in recession&mdash;Question Time will be a trying time for it. This morning we heard Senator Richardson saying on the radio that he would not like to be Leader of the Government, answering the questions every day, and that Senator Button does the job very well. Clearly, the Government finds some problems there. The Government brings on Senator Cook and Senator Bolkus every day to filibuster out Question Time, answering dorothy dixers. Senator Cook must have told us about industrial relations in New South Wales and New Zealand 50 times in the last session. He must almost be getting sick of his own voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr President, and to my Senate colleagues, that when we have a government that is seeking to abuse Question Time in that way the Opposition will not sit here mute and allow that sort of behaviour to go on. Of course we will use points of order; we will always try to make sure that those points of order are not spurious. There is a time when frustration takes over. I admit that my point of order last Thursday, in relation to the proposal for Paul Keating to introduce a goods and services tax, was frivolous. I apologise for that. This is the level of frustration which occurs. It relates to the very issue that Senator Ray pointed to; that is, goodwill and good sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Goodwill and good sense left this chamber a few weeks ago. Until they return, Ministers should understand that if they want to deceive the Australian people by attacking the Fightback package and using lies to attack it, the goodwill will evaporate. If the Government wants to put the debate onto a higher plane and talk about the philosophical aspects of the Fightback package, goodwill will prevail. If the Government seeks to mislead the chamber and the Australian people in relation to the aspects of the Fightback package, of course the proceedings of Question Time will not contain goodwill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to make&mdash;I am nearing my conclusion&mdash;concerns goodwill in relation to the chairmanship on Thursday. Senator Colston did not show goodwill towards Senator Teague. I really got angry when Senator Teague was clearly seeking the attention of the Chair while Senator Colston was sitting there, clearly knowing that Senator Teague was seeking his attention. That was something that I could not abide. Obviously, Senator Baume could not abide it either. If there had been a bit of goodwill in the full knowledge that the Opposition was totally frustrated and very angry about this legislation, and if honourable senators had been allowed to take their points of order, we would have got out of here and we would not be spending all of these hours tonight discussing the ramifications of what happened last Wednesday and Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, I wish to refer to Senator Evans's remarks about the Senate. Senator Evans has a reputation for having an incredibly quick temper. It is something that Senator Evans has been trying to control for most of his time in this Parliament. On some occasions he has been successful, on others not so successful. Last Thursday tested Senator Evans. He was unable to pass the test and lost his temper again. He reflected on this chamber where his old mate Lionel Murphy spent his years. It is not a reflection on this chamber; it is a reflection on Senator Evans. When anyone spends as much time as Senator Evans does in this chamber and holds the chamber with such a lack of respect as Senator Evans does, it is clearly a reflection on him. All it says about that particular honourable senator is that it is well and truly time that he gave up and got out of this chamber. If he cannot move to the House of Representatives successfully, he should get out and go to the Bar or do something else constructive because he is wasting our time here. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a) Flock reduction made necessary by a downturn in demand is done through normal commercial channels, namely sale to registered meatworks for slaughter for human consumption and abattoir by-products, or sale to rendering or knackery works for use in petfood and by-products. Where large numbers need to be disposed of quickly, commercial disposal is supplemented by on-farm destruction of animals for which the likely sale price would not cover the cost of transport to the point of sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main means of on-farm destruction is by firearm, usually a .22 rifle, or, where small numbers are involved, by captive bolt or electrical stunning and bleeding out by severing the major arteries of the throat.  Both these methods are approved under the Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals - Sheep, endorsed by the Australian Agricultural Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carcases are buried in on-farm pits or pits managed by local councils, or, where burial is impractical due to lack of suitable equipment, the nature of the soil or the location of the water table, burnt or left to decompose on the surface.  Surface decay over time is the least expensive disposal option and requires no equipment, although a large concentration of carcases may give rise to environmental and health concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 10,543,831 sheep disposed of under the Flock Reduction Scheme which operated for 5 months until February 1991 as part of the Australian Wool Corporation's business plan to support the Reserve Price Scheme, approximately 88% were disposed of in on-farm pits, 2% were disposed of in council pits, 4% were sold to rendering and knackery works and 6% were sold through the Computer-Aided Livestock Marketing (CALM) Service to registered abattoirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (b) Sheep which have been severely burnt are usually shot on site. Less severely affected sheep must be treated in accordance with veterinary medical guidelines and may be transported to abattoirs for salvage slaughter within 24 hours, before any secondary infection develops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If pasture has been destroyed, supplementary feeding, agistment to unaffected areas or commercial disposal may be necessary.  Where none of these options are viable, humane destruction and on-farm or off-farm pit burial may be carried out as a last resort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current economic climate salvage slaughter would be an unlikely option, as the return for burnt stock is low.  The current revision of the Model Code of Practice for the Transport of Livestock will take into account the need for guidelines on transport of stock affected by fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought affected stock are disposed of through the normal commercial channels, including the sale of livestock to farms unaffected by drought.  As a last resort, where animals can no longer be fed and their condition is such that they have no commercial value or they are too weak to be transported to the point of sale, the animals are destroyed on-farm, by the same means as for flock reduction. Preferential culling to maintain flock or herd structure may be included in this exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State Departments of Agriculture have guidelines on the management of stock affected by fire and drought, and also on emergency destruction and disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Blood and bone is an abattoir by-product utilising the waste from carcase processing, being based mainly on blood and bone tissues rather than on whole carcases, and is used as a fertiliser to provide the plant nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures are not available for determining how much blood and bone fertiliser may be obtained from the whole carcases of sheep or cattle.  A whole 30kg sheep carcase will provide approximately 300 grams of phosphorus, 740 grams of nitrogen, 60 grams of potassium and 45 grams of sulphur, but the material making up blood and bone is of different composition to a whole carcase.  Commercial blood and bone fertiliser contains 4% to 7% nitrogen and 3% to 9% phosphorus by weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) There are clear health risks associated with decomposing carcases. As composting is the process of obtaining fertiliser through the decomposition of organic matter, it is not a viable option for nutrient extraction from dead stock.  Sterilisation by heat treatment as employed in the blood and bone production process or in the rendering process is essential to remove the health risk associated with animal decomposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other option which has not yet been explored could be the mining of pits at some later time for nutrient extraction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In 1989 the Meat Research Corporation, formerly the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation (AMLRDC), as part of its program to maximise returns from sheep in over supply, funded a project to examine on-farm processing of cast-for-age sheep which was carried out by the CSIRO Meat Research Laboratory.  The project was completed in March 1990.  A similar project was carried out by CSIRO Division of Food Research in 1987 as a direct response from the Corporation in preparing for the possibility of a flock reduction exercise, and was reported in AMLRDC Report No. 87/11.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective in both cases was to develop a low cost method of converting carcases to meat meal with a mobile unit which would process animals on-farm.  The process was found to be not feasible economically due to the high capital cost of equipment, although most of the technical problems were overcome and meat meal of acceptable quality was produced.  The processes examined included drying, shredding and drying, freezing and the use of stabilised slurries of carcases with special chemical agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The cost of pit burial of unwanted and unsaleable livestock can be viewed in terms of human, animal or plant nutrients.  Assessment of whether this resource is lost by the humane slaughter of animals and the disposal of carcases in pits depends on the  suitability of the recovered product, the cost of energy involved in recovery of product and the monetary cost of recovering product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example, for the 9.5 million sheep disposed of under the recent Flock Reduction Scheme, based on an average liveweight of 25kg or 35kg, this would have represented:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">as the quality of meat meal is essential to efficiency of pig and poultry production, the benefit of recovery would depend upon the unlikely event of all product being used within its shelf-life;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of disposal in pits or by burning, apart from rendering unnecessary the costs of recovering, processing, storing and marketing what is largely an unwanted product, include preservation of community health and environmental standards through the sanitary disposal of carcases.  Additional benefits include the minimising of blowfly breeding in carcases which would otherwise be left to decay in the open, environmental repercussions such as smell and contamination of water supplies, weed growth and accessibility to scavengers and predators.</PARA>
