<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to press reports that a Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) television crew entered Papua New Guinea illegally to make a television program covering events on Bougainville. Are the reports correct? If so, what action is being taken in relation to these breaches by an Australian Government instrumentality of Papua New Guinea immigration, customs and quarantine laws?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position of the Australian Government is that Bougainville is, of course, part of Papua New Guinea. Accordingly, journalists going to any part of Papua New Guinea must, like any other visitors, follow PNG Government entry procedures. In the light of Prime Minister Namaliu's comments about an illegal visit by an SBS team to Bougainville, I understand that Mr Beaz- ley has sought a report from the head of the SBS, Mr Brian Johns. Until we get the results of that report, it is difficult to comment further, except to say this: the Australian Government does not, of course, seek to direct the Australian media. It does, nonetheless, expect all Australians overseas to abide by the laws and regulations of the countries they visit. There is no reason whatsoever to exempt journalists, simply as journalists, from the scope of that general prescription.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not possibly confirm that report; it is based on absolutely no factual information at all. In fact, I deny that story categorically. I understand the journalist concerned did ring people in the Department of Defence with this particular story, was given the correct facts, chose not to print them but instead to print a lot of distortions and inventions. The only potential Australian pilots in that region are the ones I mentioned before-those on exchange. I think currently there is one Chinook pilot and two crew on a C130. As I have indicated I think at a previous press conference, at least one F118 pilot is on exchange and could be deployed there if his unit goes there. But the story basically is a fabrication and should be totally denied.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to comments reported last Friday, 15 February, by the new Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Tony Cole:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . consumption tax is an efficient tax system-very hard for people to avoid and also a system that can reduce the impact of taxes on inputs to business and on exports. So I have seen advantages in a consumption tax . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Minister agree that these advantages would accompany a consumption tax and, if so, why does the Government not now support the coalition's call for the introduction of such a tax?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer made a full statement about this matter last year in the House of Representatives. First of all, there are many clear advantages and many clear disadvantages of a consumption tax. It is a matter of judgment and balance as to whether we introduce one in particular circumstances and at a particular time. Mr Cole, the new Secretary to the Treasury, in the course of a series of Industry Commission reports, has referred to this issue as well as to other issues of taxation reform. In one sense, in his new role as Secretary to the Treasury there is nothing particularly new in what he is saying. However, I should make the point that Mr Cole, the Secretary to the Treasury, does not agree with the Opposition's position on this issue. For example, on Friday Mr Cole stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I have never regarded it as the thing that would lift Australia's savings rate to the rate that it ought to be or that it would solve our current account problem.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, on Friday Dr Hewson supported the introduction of a consumption tax. He used the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>In order to try and change the incentives to save and thereby the magnitude of total savings.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a clear difference of emphasis, degree and philosophy between Mr Cole and the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, on that particular issue of what a consumption tax might do to the savings ratio in Australia. Of course, as Senator Short pointed out in his question, Mr Cole did say that a consumption tax was efficient in that it was hard to avoid. That is certainly true, but there are other means of ensuring efficiencies in the taxation system. This Government has taken a variety of steps not only to broaden the tax base but also to ensure efficiencies in taxation collection. The Opposition, for example, still advocates a rorting of the capital gains tax, which is something that this Government would not countenance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for that answer. I draw his attention to the fact that the new Secretary to the Treasury does, in fact, say that the consumption tax would have a positive impact on savings, contrary to the Minister's statement. I ask: would the Minister not agree that introducing a consumption tax would be a more efficient method of assisting our export industries, and, hence, our ongoing balance of payments crisis, in a fair and equitable way than the various proposals which have been floated in the media as being considered for the 12 March industry statement, such as piecemeal changes to the ramshackle wholesale sales tax system?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am as bored as all hell by the various ideas that have been floated in the media-highly speculative ideas about a whole range of issues. I do not know where all these suggestions come from, but I must say that I have not contributed to that debate in the media about these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say that yes, having regard to the fact that the majority of countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-perhaps nearly all of the countries in the OECD-now have a consumption tax of some kind or another, generally a value added tax, the existence of those taxes alleviates some burdens on their export sectors, which are not alleviated here under the present taxation regime. So, the answer to that part of the honourable senator's question is yes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Can the Minister advise the Senate as to the outcome of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' meeting on Southern Africa which he attended in London over the weekend? How long before sanctions will start to be lifted? What is the situation as far as the sports boycott is concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="674" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were three important outcomes from the meeting I attended in London over the weekend. In the first place there was acceptance of the principle of phased relaxation of sanctions in response to further concrete developments as they occur-in effect, acceptance of the notion that sanctions pressure should be maintained until irreversible intentions become irreversible achievements-but that as such achievements do occur sanctions policy should be modified accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, there was agreement that the time to make the first move in this respect will be after an initial threshold has been overcome-a threshold involving three specific elements, all of which are expected to fall into place within the next three to four months: that is to say, in the first place the release of political prisoners and the indemnification of exiles, which is agreed now to be resolved by 30 April. A resolution is also involved of outstanding issues relating to security legislation. That is expected to be sorted out this parliamentary session, by the end of June at the very latest. The third element in this initial threshold is what happens after the promised repeal occurs-also expected this parliamentary session-of the remaining major legislative pillars of apartheid, namely, the Group Areas, Lands and Population Registrations Acts.</PARA>
<PARA> The third element in the weekend's proceedings that I think was important was the separate and distinct agreement reached in relation to sport; namely, that there should be no barriers placed on the resumption of international sporting contacts in respect of those sports which have achieved unified non-racial administration and which have been recognised in that respect by the relevant representative non-racial sporting organisation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know exactly what the communique says because I wrote those particular words in question, and the language of the communique in question says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Taking account of these developments the Committee agreed to present to the Harare Heads of Government Meeting further specific proposals by which the Commonwealth can continue to encourage non-racial sport.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth of the matter, as I think I know rather better than Senator Hill, is that the statement has been clearly and unequivocally laid down, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee agreed that it was appropriate for those sporting codes which achieve unity to be recognised by the international community. The Committee also agreed that the Commonwealth should continue to be guided in this respect by the views of representative non-racial sporting organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the two elements of the agreement in principle. Naturally, the actual implementation of that will take some time, as the unification process takes time within each of these sports in question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What does it mean?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What it means, so far as sport is concerned, is simply this: there are ample grounds for optimism and that, that agreement in principle-as I have described-having been reached, obstacles to sporting contacts will be able to be progressively removed over the course of the next year. So far as individual sports are concerned this means: for soccer, this unquestion- ably will happen within that time frame because a unified administration is a recognised reality almost now; so far as cricket is concerned, unity is expected to be achieved by about June; so far as the Olympic sports are concerned, unity is expected round about the end of the year; for rugby, there is still, however, a question mark because negotiations have been stalled for some time but efforts are being made to regain momentum and it just is not possible to predict a timetable at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important thing about all of this is that sport is being treated now with the complete agreement of the Commonwealth Ministers from all the countries concerned as a separate and distinct issue with criteria for resolution of its own. That is something that has been foreshadowed for some time, but this is the first time that that agreement has been reached in principle.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as sanctions generally are concerned, the general understanding was reached, although this was only partially explicit in terms of the communique, that it would be appropriate for the relaxation of sanctions to be considered in roughly the following order as various milestones are reached: first of all, people-oriented sanctions-that is, consular, cultural, air links and tourism types of issues; trade and investment sanctions; financial sanctions, including International Monetary Fund loans; and, finally, the arms embargo.</PARA>
<PARA> The first important milestone will be the achievement of the legislative changes that I have referred to and the resolution of the obstacles issues that I have referred to relating to prisoners and exiles. It is reasonable to anticipate on the basis of the discussions that took place over the weekend that when this happens at least the so-called people-oriented sanctions will be capable of modification. Subsequent milestones are rather less clearly defined at this stage. They are only the subject of indicative reference in the communique, but Commonwealth Ministers will be in a better position to resolve these and other questions of detail when we next meet, as is currently proposed, in late May.</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the meeting, while it was not for a variety of reasons an easy one in which to achieve consensus, very much succeeded in meeting Australian objectives. These objectives were essentially to get Commonwealth sanctions policy reshaped in a measured, balanced and realistic fashion so as to ensure in turn a continuing influential role for the Commonwealth not only in its own member countries but also in the evolution of policy in the United States of America, Europe and Japan-all of which are crucially important players if external pressure is to be effectively maintained on South Africa until the destruction of apartheid is finally assured. Given the haranguing I have been subjected to, it might be appropriate for me to seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the text of the communique of the weekend.</PARA>

<PARA>CONCLUDING STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Recent Developments in South Africa</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa met in a special session in London on 16 February to review recent developments in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The immediate background to the meeting was President de Klerk's statement of 1 February 1991 to the South African Parliament in which he endorsed the concept of a multi-party conference to advance constitutional negotiations and announced the Government's intention to introduce legislation to repeal</PARA>
<PARA>- the Land Acts of 1913 and 1936;</PARA>
<PARA>- the Group Areas Act of 1956;</PARA>
<PARA>- the Development of Black Communities Act of 1984; and</PARA>
<PARA>- the Population Registration Act of 1950.</PARA>
<PARA>3. The Committee also took particular note of the `Manifesto for the New South Africa', also published on 1 February 1991, in which the South African Government committed itself to `the creation of a free and democratic political system' in which</PARA>
<PARA>- all the people of South Africa `shall participate fully at all levels of Government, on the basis of universal adult franchise';</PARA>
<PARA>- government shall `at all times be based upon the consent of the governed';</PARA>
<PARA>- `all people shall be equal before the law and shall enjoy equal rights regardless of race, colour, sex or creed'; and</PARA>
<PARA>- `all discrimination between groups of people or between individuals shall be eliminated and discriminatory legislation shall be repealed'.</PARA>
<PARA>4. The Committee welcomed these latest pronouncements and commitments. They agreed that these developments were a substantial progress on the situation since their last meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, in May 1990 and that when implemented in full, and taken together with the measures introduced by the Government in February 1990, would constitute a major advance towards the ending of apartheid.</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Response</PARA>
<PARA>5. In considering an appropriate response to these developments, the Committee recalled the objective of Commonwealth policy towards South Africa over the years, viz eradication of apartheid and the establishment of majority rule on the basis of free and fair exercise of universal adult suffrage by all the people in a united and nonfragmented South Africa. The Commonwealth had also consistently maintained that the forms of political settlement in South Africa were for the people of that country-all the people-to determine. In this connection the Committee noted that the Groote Schuur Meeting of May 1990 and the Pretoria Meeting the following August between the Government and the African National Congress (ANC) had led to a number of important agreements, relating to the removal of preliminary obstacles to negotiations, which agreements have now been confirmed by the announcement on 15 February of the adoption of the recommendations of the South African Government/ANC Working Group relating to the release of prisoners, the return of exiles and the suspension of the armed struggle.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Notwithstanding these welcome developments, Ministers noted that there had as yet been very little change on the ground and that there had been more promises than concrete action by the South African Government. The Committee expressed particular concern over continuing constraints on political freedom. In the Groote Schuur and Pretoria Minutes, the Government undertook to review security legislation, repeal its repressive provisions and present amendments in the present session of Parliament. Despite assurances that this pledge will be fulfilled, the Government continues to make massive arrests and clings to the most repressive provisions of all, detention without trial and restrictions on public meetings. The Committee stressed that due process of law and the freedoms of assembly and expression are universal human rights, and called on the Government to give effect to them without delay.</PARA>
<PARA>Support for Negotiations</PARA>
<PARA>7. The Committee gave close and extensive consideration to how the Commonwealth could best assist the reform process in all the current circumstances. At Abuja the Committee had affirmed that the Commonwealth stood ready to assist in facilitating the negotiating process and had in this context welcomed initiatives to provide assistance such as constitutional expertise and funding for research, conferences and seminars on issues and options for a postapartheid South Africa. The Committee reaffirmed this commitment, and the continuing readiness of the Commonwealth to assist the process of negotiations in any other way that might be deemed appropriate by the parties concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Sanctions</PARA>
<PARA>8. The purpose of sanctions is to end apartheid: Commonwealth leaders have repeatedly made it clear that their purpose is not punitive but to bring the South African Government to the negotiating table and to keep it there until fundamental and irreversible change had been secured. Sanctions have been crucial in bringing about the changes which have occurred to date, and will go on being crucial if the destruction of apartheid is to be ultimately assured. Ministers' firm view, accordingly, was that it was crucial to maintain sanctions pressure through all stages of that process, up to and including the adoption of a new constitution. They also emphasised the importance of the Commonwealth remaining united and purposeful in its application of sanctions, and continuing to play a catalytic role in shaping world opinions in respect of the unfolding events in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>9. In this context, Ministers agreed that, while it was not yet time to lift sanctions, the most effective way of securing these objectives in the crucial months ahead would be for sanctions pressure to be maintained by a programmed management approach, relating any change in the application of sanctions not to mere statements of intention but to the adoption of real and practical steps in the destruction of apartheid.</PARA>
<PARA>10. They agreed that the elements in this programme should be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) All existing measures should be maintained in their present form until the obstacles to negotiation are overcome in accordance with the Pretoria Minute of 6 August 1990, and the three legislative pillars of apartheid identified in President de Klerk's speech of 1 February 1991 have been repealed as there promised, i.e. until:</PARA>
<PARA> - remaining political prisoners have been released;</PARA>
<PARA> - the way has been cleared for exiles to return home;</PARA>
<PARA> - repressive security legislation has been reviewed and repealed; and</PARA>
<PARA> - the Group Areas Act, Lands Acts, and Population Registration Act have been repealed.</PARA>
<PARA> When these conditions have been fulfilled, this Committee will meet again after 30 April 1991, in New Delhi to consider the appropriate response.</PARA>
<PARA>(b) The most important forms of pressure on the South African Government-trade and investment sanctions and, above all else, the financial sanctions, including lending by international financial institutions like the IMF-should not be modified until some further major step has been taken down the path of constitutional reform. This could take the form of the establishment of an interim government; the establishment of a constituent assembly or some other agreed constitution-making process marking the commencement of final negotiations; or any other form agreed by the multi-party conference.</PARA>
<PARA>(c) The arms embargo-applied by the United Nations and supported by a variety of specific Commonwealth measures-should not be lifted until such time as the new constitution is firmly in place: it is not until the new post-apartheid South Africa is firmly established with full democratic control and accountability, that the supply of arms should be countenanced by the international community.</PARA>
<PARA>Sporting Contacts with South Africa</PARA>
<PARA>11. The Committee warmly welcomed the steps taken by a number of sports organisations within South Africa. Encouraging progress has been made in several codes towards unifying sport under non-racial administration. The Committee agreed that Commonwealth support and encouragement for the unity talks must be of the highest priority, and noted the importance of assisting disadvantaged South African sports organisations, to which member governments were already providing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>12. The Committee agreed that it was appropriate for those sporting codes which achieve unity to be recognised by the international community. The Committee also agreed that the Commonwealth should continue to be guided in this respect by the views of representative non-racial sporting organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>13. The Committee agreed that it was important that the international community-governments no less than international sports federations- respond collectively and appropriately to developments in South African sport, and in particular to the wishes of the non-racial sports movement whose work to date has been greatly aided by the sports boycott. Taking account of these developments the Committee agreed to present to the Harare Heads of Government Meeting further specific proposals by which the Commonwealth can continue to encourage non-racial sport.</PARA>
<PARA>Human Resource Development for a Post-Apartheid South Africa</PARA>
<PARA>14. The Committee welcomed the Interim Report of the Expert Group and looked forward to the Commonwealth playing as significant a role in the human resource development of a post-apartheid South Africa as it had done in the elimination of apartheid. While the full elaboration of such a programme would have to await the Committee's final report and further political evolution within South Africa, there was an urgent need to take action now if there was to be a smooth transition to the promised nonracial democracy. In this context, and with a view to preparing black South Africans to take senior jobs in government, the Committee endorsed the Expert Group's emphasis on an immediate Commonwealth programme of training and work placements in the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA>- central administration including judicial, economic, legal, police and security services;</PARA>
<PARA>- local government structures including all essential services;</PARA>
<PARA>- technical services including management of educational institutions, transport and communication.</PARA>
<PARA>15. While much of the training and work placements would need to be offered outside South Africa, the Committee agreed that, subject to the criteria laid down by the Expert Group, a beginning should also be made to support training and placements within South Africa in the interests of speed and cost-effectiveness. The training and rehabilitation of returning exiles merited particular attention.</PARA>
<PARA>16. In endorsing the Expert Group's Report, members of the Committee pledged assistance from their governments in the implementation of its recommendations and were confident that all Commonwealth governments would wish to join in this important endeavour. They requested the SecretaryGeneral to initiate the necessary action to get the programme going as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Does the Government accept United Nations (UN) estimates that the Gulf war will produce between 300,000 and two million refugees; World Bank estimates that the war has already cost developing countries $30 billion; United States estimates that the cost of its own war operations will be at least $645m per day; Saudi estimates that the Gulf oil slick carries a clean-up cost of between $1 billion and $5 billion; and other estimates that the cost of rebuilding Kuwait will exceed $60 billion, a high proportion of which will be attributable to war damage?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first part of the question about accepting various UN numerical estimates of costs and numbers, all I can say is that I have seen all those figures but neither I nor anyone else in the Government has any way at this stage of assessing their accuracy. I make the point that the anticipated 300,000 refugees, although that was a planning figure that has been adopted by a number of agencies, has not yet proven to be anything like realised. The current estimates of refugees are of the order of 15,000 to 20,000 people only, and that is, of course, after four weeks of steadily escalating hostilities. So nothing of that order of magnitude may be realised at all. I certainly hope that that will be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the subject of figures, I mention that conspicuous absentees from Senator Powell's list of figures were the $50 billion that Iraq has spent on military armament purchases alone over the last 10 years and the nearly $200 billion that Iraq has spent on total defence expenditure over that period. Unless one takes into account the reality of that expenditure on that side of the ledger and the threat that that posed to everyone in the region and, indeed, the wider world then one has a very narrow and distorted view of what this issue is all about.</PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Powell's second question asking whether I can provide the Senate with estimates of costs arising from the destruction-no, I cannot and I do not think anyone can at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the third question as to whether we made any formal assessment of whether the cost of fighting the Middle East war was justified before deciding to support it-no, we did not make any such formal assessment because we do not make decisions about war and peace, with all that that implies, on the basis of dollar and cents considerations; we make it on the basis of considerations of morality, considerations of justice and considerations of an intelligent appreciation of the consequences of not acting, all of which considerations seem to be utterly beyond the intellectual resources of the Australian Democrats.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was indeed a pretty sad performance on the weekend by Mr Howard, which marked him out as a genuine yesterday's man on these matters. However, Mr Howard can claim some knowledge in talking about hours and remuneration. It cannot be said that he does not know much about the subject because he was the Treasurer in 1979-81 when hours were reduced from 40 to 38, in some cases to 37 1/2 and, in some rare cases, to 35 1/2, at a time when wages were going up, when the economy had that double digit unemployment and double digit inflation, when we had negative economic growth, when we had a higher level of industrial disputation and, generally, when things were in chaos for the reason that the Opposition had no wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this context it is true to say that, since 1983, when matters of the reduction in working hours have been canvassed, we have been successful in having the Industrial Relations Commission accept that unions have to produce some trade-off which justifies a reduction in hours so that there is no overwhelming cost impost because of that. That is an aspect of the wages policy we have been able to administer through the accord. That has helped the economy considerably.</PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with what Mr Howard said on the weekend is that no-one believes him. No-one believes that if the work force works longer hours then there will be more work around. The truth is that, currently in some industries, workers and employers, particularly in factories, are negotiating shorter hours to protect employment. It is possible to see that, if all workers worked longer hours, that would be a recipe for redundancy and that, in the end, fewer people would be working.</PARA>
<PARA> The allegation that it might have an impact on unit labour costs can well and truly be countered by arguing that it would also have an impact on reducing the take- home pay of ordinary workers. Certainly, it would set back quite considerably the huge gains made in this economy by award restructuring and by getting workers in Australia under the award restructuring structural efficiency principle of the national wage case to work smarter, as they are now doing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that I am unable to accede to Senator Coates's suggestion. I say at the outset that I certainly share what I understand to be his hope that the action taken so far, with all its enormously regrettable but nonetheless inevitable consequences in terms of human suffering, would have been enough to persuade the Iraqi authorities that they should comply with the clearly stated will of the international community and get out of Kuwait. But I do not agree that Saddam Hussein has yet given any sign of genuine willingness to withdraw from Kuwait. There has been some speculation that the Iraqi statement of 15 February might have been intended to be such a sign, but it is hard to pursue such a line of speculation very seriously when one looks at the extraordinarily heavily-conditioned and equivocal nature of the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from all the linkages and conditions that it contained, which I shall mention in a moment, there was no undertaking to accept or comply with United Nations Security Council resolution 660, only to `deal with' that resolution. While there was a reference to withdrawal, there was no specific mention of Kuwait in that context at all. There is a difficulty about even accepting what seemed to be the most central and unequivocal part of the statement. It is much more difficult to take the statement seriously when one looks at the list of conditions which were associated with it. Those conditions include: first of all, abolition or abrogation of all other United Nations Security Council resolutions on the crisis, suggesting in that respect that Iraq should bear no responsibility whatever for the devastation and other costs associated with its aggression against Kuwait. Secondly, there is a condition of complete withdrawal of all coalition troops within one month of the cease-fire, unaccompanied by any reference to any timetable for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. There was very explicit linkage with an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, or Palestine as it is referred to in the statement.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a demand for a guarantee of Iraq's historical rights on land and sea, which suggests some implicit acknowledgment of Iraq's claims over Kuwait. It is clearly very problematical in that respect. There is a requirement of a reconstruction of Iraq, without Iraq incurring any expense whatsoever of its own in that reconstruction; and there is a requirement about the cancellation of the foreign debts of Iraq and other regional countries, creating a situation where Iraq is demanding to be rewarded for its invasion, a patently unacceptable outcome. In short, if Iraq wants to send a signal to the international community, it will have to be very much clearer, very much less equivocal than this, and absolutely unconditional in its acceptance of United Nations Security Council resolution 660 and the subsequent resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA> It flows from what I have said that Australia will not be suggesting to other coalition members that there should be any pause in the military efforts to achieve Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. There simply is no basis for suspending the military action authorised by resolution 678 and, as the Prime Minister said over the weekend, to take the pressure off Iraq at this time in response to such a manifestly unacceptable proposition would give Saddam Hussein a chance to regroup and rebuild. The Australian Government hopes that the current diplomatic activities, including in particular those in Moscow, might yet lead to a positive sign of Iraq's preparedness to withdraw immediately and unconditionally from Kuwait. Certainly we remain confident that if and when such advice is received from Iraq, the coalition will respond appropriately.</PARA>

I know that Senator Childs, as President of the parliamentary committee for UNICEF, is a very keen supporter of the United Nations Children's Fund and the work it is doing for the welfare of millions of mothers and children throughout the developing world. My colleague Dr Blewett did last week, as Senator Childs said, launch in Australia UNICEF's report The State of the World's Children 1991. As Dr Blewett observed, this report is internationally recognised as the most authoritative annual statement on the situation of children throughout the world. It does document the challenge faced by the international community in protecting the world's needy children and describes UNICEF's successes and achievements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The task is immense. This year 14 million children will die from easily preventable causes-diseases, such as measles and whooping cough, which we in the developed countries have almost completely forgotten. The report focuses attention on the continuing and ongoing tragedy of sick and poor children, a problem for which there is simply no quick solution. With immediate and more sensational world crises constantly pressing upon us, it is crucial that the plight of children not be forgotten. The task of reducing the tragedy of 40,000 child deaths every day-that is what it amounts to-does fall to us: all individuals, non-government organisations and governments. That is one of the successful thrusts of the UNICEF report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is a strong supporter of the UNICEF programs. We presently direct over $11m per annum to UNICEF and its field programs and more than that in support of women and children through other parts of the aid program. As tangible support for UNICEF efforts in child health, I had the pleasure in New York last year of passing to UNICEF the rights to a new and very innovative solar powered weighing scale invented by an Australian-a gift worth something over $1m. That hand-over followed Australia's participation in the World Summit for Children. Australia endorsed the declaration that emerged from that about the survival, protection and development of children.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler, in the first part of his question, refers to the question of granting income tax powers to the States. I think Senator Spindler ought to be aware that these issues are being given detailed consideration in the special Premiers Conference process which was launched by the Prime Minister last year. That is to say that all options in respect of tax sharing powers between the States and the Commonwealth can be examined in the context of that conference, presuming they are put forward by the States. I cannot imagine, however, that any State government would seek the power to levy income tax. After all, that option was open to them for most of the last decade under legislation introduced by the Fraser Government. That is a matter for the States to consider and if they want to put it on the agenda for the Premiers Conference, they are free to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Spindler also asked whether I was in favour of giving local communities a greater say. Of course, I am in favour of giving local communities a greater say. Everybody is in favour of giving local communities a greater say. Perhaps the Australian Democrats have a bigger warm inner glow about this issue than anybody else. It is all very well to sit in the corner of this chamber and talk about giving local communities a bigger say. The question is how we do it. It is easy to have a bit of woolly rhetoric about the topic, but there is a nice question about what we do to ensure that result.</PARA>
<PARA> In Senator Spindler's question, he also suggested that the present three tier structure of government in Australia is not the most desirable in the world. I share his view totally about that, so he should not think that he is on his own with that one. But, of course, it is implicit in the very fact that there is an ongoing conference between the Commonwealth Government and the State governments regarding division of powers between the States and the Commonwealth and it is implicit in that that this Government accepts that the situation is likely to remain for some time into the foreseeable future. But, as I have said, if he is asking me for a personal opinion, I inform him that I do subscribe to the view that Australia has too many tiers of government.</PARA>

The reason that it would be necessary for the Prime Minister to talk to the States about it is that extensions of fringe benefits, while comparatively cheap for the Commonwealth, are of course very expensive indeed for the States. That is because over the years the regime has developed whereby so many concessions are offered by the States, particularly to those who hold pensioner health benefit cards. A working party is looking at that question at the moment and it is something I hope to be able to take up over the next year or two. I would hope that the first step in the process, if we can reach agreement on it, would be to extend our fringe benefits to those pensioners who currently do not hold them, that is, those who are above that rate, which is $95 or $98 or something at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assume that Senator Patterson is referring to the press release that she put out, which I had a look at this morning. The situation with deeming was, of course, that we announced that no-one would lose fringe benefits as a result of deeming. When pensioners, especially those who are getting on in years and have mobility problems, et cetera, are being asked to go and change their affairs to comply with the deeming rule, then I think it appropriate that those people should not have to put up with losing fringe benefits as well. That decision is one which has received no criticism from anyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question then is: how far ought that privilege extend? Should it extend to those who have already maximised their incomes and lost fringe benefits, and beyond? In my view-and I want to stress that it is a personal view and not a matter of Government policy-it certainly ought to go further than it does now. As I said before, the Commonwealth Government cannot take those kind of decisions on its own; it has to have the States going with it otherwise any hope of uniformity in fringe benefits would become a forlorn hope indeed. I am not against an extension and it is something I will work at over the next two years. But Senator Patterson might be able to help us because the State Premier who railed against it the loudest and the longest was, of course, the Liberal Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner.</PARA>

That particular action was brought by the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is an important decision, though I understand that the Tobacco Institute has indicated that it will appeal the decision and, therefore, I do not want to go into every detail of it. But I think it was an important affirmation of the function of the Trade Practices Act in that there are provisions within that particular statute dealing with deceptive or misleading advertising.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it was important that in this case it was not the Trade Practices Commission itself which took on the Tobacco Institute but the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. For them to pursue this vitally important public interest issue, taking grave risks, given the costs that were likely to be awarded if they lost and so on, I think is a very courageous step on their behalf. Indeed, they had so little funding available that I provided some $370,000 towards the costs of that particular case. I remember that Senator Peter Baume and I late last year had to do quite a bit of lobbying of various kinds in order to secure help towards the costs of the Australian Federation of Consumers Organisations in order to fight this particular action.</PARA>

I believe that it has shown that it is concerned about these great public interest issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. Does the Government support moves by some sections of the Civil Aviation Authority to de-man the Hobart Airport air traffic control centre and to monitor the airport from Melbourne? Does the Government have a view on similar moves to de-man Launceston Airport after midnight, thereby ensuring that air freight movements at Tasmania's busiest airport would be controlled by remote monitoring in Melbourne? What arrangements currently exist for the rescue of passengers from ditched aircraft in the waters adjacent to Hobart Airport following the sale of the airport's rescue boats? Under what circumstances is the Government prepared to accept the inevitable deterioration of Tasmania's air safety standards which would accompany the de-manning of the local air traffic control network?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is currently engaged in a major overhaul of all of its services in Australia. The organisation employs in excess of 7,000 employees. It is widely acknowledged in the industry-and certainly supported by this Government-that a review is required of the services that are being provided, the purpose for which they are being provided, and whether the personnel required to deliver those services is too little or too much. That is exactly what the CAA is doing. The Chairman of the CAA only last week sent out a circular to all of the staff of the CAA advising them of this process. Of course, the CAA has recently had a new chief executive officer commence on 14 January this year to oversight that operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the question Senator Calvert raised, I can say in a general sense-and I am happy to go into more detail outside of Question Time because of the unofficial time limit on these answers and the complaints we constantly receive from the Opposition about going on too long-that there will be no reduction, as a result of these changes, in the level of safety. The CAA's primary concern and priority remain safety, and always will remain safety. But I have to say that there is no question that, in respect of some of the services that have been provided for years in communities where the level of air activity can no longer justify them, I have no personal concern that it is about time that those areas were looked at; and that is exactly what is being done.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the primary concern of the CAA is safety. We have in this country-as has been reiterated before-one of the best safety records in the world in terms of the operations of large jet aircraft. It is the intention of this Government to maintain that situation.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware of a newspaper report that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) is concerned about the size of the working holiday-makers program and that it is not being adequately monitored to ensure that workers are not being exploited and do not prevent the employment of residents? What action is the Government taking to ensure that abuses of that program do not occur?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="688" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of that article in the Age of 11 February this year. It is an article which canvasses the holiday worker program. The program in question is one that has been working for quite some years now and in fact operates under arrangement with the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Netherlands, Japan and Ireland. As well as the formal arrangement situation with those countries, we take holiday worker program applicants from other countries as well in instances where that would be mutually advantageous to both Australia and the people involved. However, 90 per cent of total working holiday-makers come from those agreement countries; in fact, 60 per cent of them come from the UK.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme is geared towards, and has the objective of, providing opportunities for young people to appreciate the culture of another country while undertaking incidental employment. I think the ACTU had two specific concerns: one was the actual number of working holiday-maker arrivals in Australia. There has in fact been a major increase in the number since 1983-84, when something fewer than 6,000 working holiday-makers arrived here. In the financial year 1988-89 the number was somewhere in the vicinity of 45,000. However, in the last financial year there has been a trending back of about 10 per cent, to 40,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The article makes the point-I think it is one that has been acknowledged in the community-that the report on which the article is based, the report of the National Population Council, concludes that the program is valuable and not a threat to local jobs and conditions. In essence, the National Population Council report found that there was a minor but beneficial effect on the labour market, particularly in the service and hospitality industries and certain areas of skill shortages. The Council found that most working holiday-makers were paid either above or at the standard award rate; it also found that there was some evidence of below award rates but indicated in its report that this occurred mainly in industries with low levels of unionisations, high labour turnover and casual employment, and went on to indicate that this was not specifically related to this particular program but the below award wages and conditions were in areas where they would apply generally in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> The report indicated that there was a minor but beneficial effect on the labour market. I should also indicate to the Senate, given the fact that the question of ACTU concern was raised both in the article and by Senator Zakharov, that no problems relating to the working holidaymaker visa scheme were raised by ACTU representatives in consultations on the migration program with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand, in Melbourne about two weeks ago.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the last day of sitting Senator Short asked me about delays in the answer to a question directed to me as Minister representing the Treasurer. Largely, that question related to the Financial Corporations Act and certain procedures taken under that Act. I undertook to provide an answer by today. It is in answer to a question on notice. In the circumstances I seek leave to have that answer incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>1. Part III of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 gives the Reserve Bank the power to collect statistics from corporations subject to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The information collected under the Financial Corporations (Statistics) Regulations dated 18 May 1984 varies for the different categories of corporations. For building societies it includes aggregated statistics on lending and borrowing, selected liabilities, assets, interest rates and selected maturity dissection of borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Act requires that statistics prepared by corporations under Part III be verified by a statutory declaration made by a senior officer of the corporations.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Act relates to financial corporations which engage in the borrowing and lending of money in a major way and whose assets exceed $1 million. Certain classes of corporations are exempt from the legislation, including public authorities, authorised banks, terminating building societies, friendly or benefit societies, medical benefits organisations, life and general insurance companies and trustee companies.</PARA>
<PARA>2 &amp;3. My Department is not informed about the liquidity or viability of financial corporations as a matter of course. There is, however, a close working relationship between the Treasury and the Reserve Bank and the Bank keeps it informed of developments relevant to the stability of the financial system. Moreover, the Secretary to the Treasury, as a member of the Reserve Bank Board, receives such information as is provided to other Board members arising from the Bank's surveillance of the financial system.</PARA>
<PARA>4. I am informed that the Reserve Board receives regular reports on developments affecting the bank and non-bank sectors of the finance industry, and that the information relates to the operations of industry sectors, groups of organisations in a single group and individual entities.</PARA>
<PARA>5. (a) Yes;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (c) Yes;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Yes, but from a corporation entitled Countrywide Building Society.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Yes, but from a corporation entitled Commercial Credit Cooperative Limited.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Yes, but predominantly building societies in the Group (there are other financial intermediaries).</PARA>
<PARA>6. I am informed that the Reserve Bank had some discussions about the operations of the Farrow Group with the responsible State authorities. (See responses to parts 9 and 10). These discussions arose from concerns evident in sections of the market.</PARA>
<PARA>7. The Governor of the Reserve Bank regularly discusses economic and financial developments with the Treasurer. These discussions may include problems in particular parts of the financial system if the Governor believes that to be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>8. The Governor and I discuss the state of the economy on a regular basis and we talk face to face or by telephone whenever particular matters warrant it.</PARA>
<PARA>9. The Bank has told me that it had been generally aware for some time that the Farrow Group of building societies was exposed to a higherthan-normal operating risk because of its high rate of growth, its exposures to the commercial property sector, and its interest rate policy. Such information as was available to the Reserve Bank, however, was not an adequate basis on which to make considered judgements about the societies' viability.</PARA>
<PARA>10, 11, 12. I did not know of the financial difficulties of the Farrow Group of building societies prior to the release of a statement by the Victorian Treasurer on 13 February 1990 concerning Pyramid Building Society.</PARA>
<PARA> The only advice received by my office prior to 13 February 1990 was a minute dated 12 February which referred to an article on Pyramid that had appeared in the Sunday Herald on 11 February which stated that there had been small net withdrawals from the Society.</PARA>
<PARA> That advice could not be considered knowledge of Pyramid's difficulties. In the event the minute was not drawn to my attention as it was not considered such a serious issue at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>13. The Reserve Bank has informed me that it had discussions with Victorian Government officials on a number of occasions:</PARA>
<PARA> * On 12 and 13 February 1990-talks initiated by Victorian Office of Management and Budget in relation to its concerns about the risk of a run on Pyramid Building Society and its inquiry about the RBA's policy on liquidity support for building societies.</PARA>
<PARA> * On 15 and 20 February 1990-talks with Victorian Registrar of Co-operative Financial Institutions, initiated by RBA, to inquire about Farrow's efforts to arrange additional lines of support.</PARA>
<PARA> * On 21 February 1990-talks initiated by Victorian Office of Management and Budget to mention Farrow's liquidity difficulties and problems of securing support from banks.</PARA>
<PARA>14. I understand the Farrow Group had discussions with various financial institutions about possible lines of credit. The Reserve Bank has told me it was not party to any such discussions but it made known to banks and to the Victorian Government its longstanding and on-going policy of willingness to provide necessary liquidity support to banks which choose to lend to well-managed and viable non-bank financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>15. Not applicable; as indicated in the response to part 14, the Reserve Bank did not give its support to the provision of a line of credit to the Farrow Group.</PARA>
<PARA>16. The Reserve Bank informs me it did not meet with the Victorian Government in late March or early April 1990. There, however, were numerous discussions between various representatives of the Bank and the Victorian Government during the period from February to June 1990. These were primarily to keep the Bank informed of events as they developed; the Bank did not offer the advice mentioned in the question. I did not participate in any of the Reserve Bank's discussions.</PARA>
<PARA>17. Not applicable (refer to the response to part 16).</PARA>
<PARA>18. The Reserve Bank has informed me it did not receive a copy of an audit report by Day, Neilson, Jenkins and Johns; it did receive a copy of Price Waterhouse's summary of its review of the Farrow Corporation Limited group.</PARA>
<PARA>19. The question is based on an incorrect premise. The Reserve Bank did not see the first document referred to. It neither accepted nor rejected the latter.</PARA>
<PARA>20. The Reserve Bank does not have the power to intervene in the operations or management of non-bank financial institutions. Its longstanding policy is not to provide financial support to financial institutions it does not supervise.</PARA>
<PARA>21. I am informed that Farrow Corporation did not make application to become a bank. However, in January 1990, Farrow Corporation indicated to the Reserve Bank an intention to seek a banking licence in the medium term (3-5 years) if certain State legislative restrictions on its activities were not removed. The Bank offered no advice on its equity level, accounts or management arrangements. On 11 May 1990, an officer of Farrow Corporation arranged for Mr Farrow to meet with the Chief of Financial System Division of the Bank on 24 May, purportedly to discuss the possibility of a banking authority. The appointment was cancelled by Mr Farrow on 23 May.</PARA>
<PARA>22. I have regular discussions about economic and financial developments with both the Reserve Bank Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. There have however been no particular discussions concerning the state of Victorian building societies.</PARA>
<PARA>23. I receive many requests for meetings during the course of a year, but there is no record of any such contact with the Farrow Corporation in 1990.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a brief personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented. In the Weekend Australian last Saturday, 16 February, there is an article by Mr Greg Sheridan about my Senate speech on 12 February, in which I urged the normalisation of Australia-China relations. This article is presented in a sensationalist style and seriously misrepresents what I said. The article grossly misrepresents the whole thrust of my speech and my own assessment of the issues that currently bear upon where Australia-China relations should be heading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first misrepresentation is the article's headline, which reads, `Lib rejects Chinese massacre ``trauma''. This assertion is wrong. On the contrary, I condemn the massacre and I describe carefully how its trauma is still felt by the people of Beijing. In my speech I describe how I have recently observed that this trauma is still unresolved. I actually say that this massacre is unparalleled in Beijing's entire history. I do not reject the massacre, and I do not reject its immense trauma. </PARA>
<PARA> The second misrepresentation is found in the opening paragraph of the article, where Mr Sheridan makes the accusation that I have `opposed Opposition policy towards China'. This is not correct. Such a policy detail is not always specifically declared but is a movable feast in response to developments. It is correct to say that, in expressing my personal views, which are in entirely the same direction as all the Opposition statements since last August, I am addressing the next step in that direction, which is the timing of Australia's decision to normalise our relations with China and end the sanctions policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I am misrepresented in Mr Sheridan's article by the second headline, `Excellent propaganda'. This is mischievous and sensationalist, presumably intended to catch the reader's eye. The misrepresentation is that this headline is placed in the article at a point quite distant from the related text in such a way that it appears to denigrate my personal assessments as merely the acceptance of a foreign government's propaganda. This is not true, nor is it fair to leave open such a prejudiced interpretation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Northern Territory)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.19)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990, and the complementary Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990 and the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill 1990, is to enable the Government to provide a framework for a more efficient way in which to collect the levies that are imposed on the commodities produced by the agricultural industry. The majority of these levies are made through the rural industry research funds. They work on the basis of a dollar for dollar payment by the government and industry, up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. In total, it means that the primary industry sector provides a very substantial amount for research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons why agriculture is one of the few world competitive or efficient industries in this country is that it provides a significant contribution on its own behalf to ensure that it is productive, efficient and the other things that are necessary to be successful in the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will provide a single Act which will deal with all the levy and export charge collections. This will enable uniformity of collection methods and will permit a consistent approach to procedural matters previously embodied in more than 30 Acts. The Bills will give greater flexibility so that a whole range of different collection agencies and methods of collection can be used and a greater flexibility and efficiency are obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the levies and charges are payable by the producer or grower of produce. In order to reduce the cost of collection, the legislation provides for a better securing of payment of levy or charges, and moneys may be collected through intermediaries such as agents or exporters on behalf of producers. In addition, the Commonwealth may now enter into collection arrangements with the States, Territories and other collection organisations, subject to full consultation with industry groups. These arrangements will assist in meeting the goal to keep costs to a minimum by reducing the number of collection points. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most significant of these will be the export inspection levy. Approximately $172m is to be levied this financial year. The Government made a decision in the Federal Budget to increase the cost recovery of those charges from 60 per cent to 100 per cent. The charges apply mainly to meat, but also to grain, horticulture and the dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that in terms of cost recovery the Government could not have picked a worse time for trying to implement charges on the rural sector. The governments of most of our competitor countries pay the total amount of the inspection charge, either for public health or for export assistance reasons. The levy comes at a time of dramatically reduced, and reducing income for farmers in the cutthroat world of export competition. One only has to get out into the rural and regional parts of Australia to see how badly Australia's primary industries are faring under the present Labor Government's induced recession. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard for me not to add a touch of Northern Territory flavour in this debate. By 1992 the objectives under the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign (BTEC) will be achieved, opening export markets in South East Asia which the Northern Territory cattle industry is unable to supply in terms of the demands to markets in Asia. In 1992, with primary producers restocking cattle stations the Northern Territory is set aggressively to take on markets in the Asian region. The research and development through BTEC has meant that the Northern Territory cattle industry will certainly have increased potential in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill, which is linked to the Bill I have already addressed, amends the current Acts which impose levies and charges because these will not be empowered through the new Bill. The purpose of the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill is simply to provide for the continued existence of the national cattle disease eradiation trust account as a result of the former Livestock Slaughter Levy Collection Act being repealed through the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill which was presented earlier. The trust account facilitates the financial operations of the national program for cattle disease eradication. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted many comments in the media and generally in recent days, and in particular by the Opposition spokesman on primary industry, Mr Lloyd, that the recent Australian Agricultural Outlook Conference in Canberra gave a very dismal and dreary forecast for the rural sector of Australia. There are certainly predictions floating around that the rural area is going through a disastrous period and that in particular wool and wheat are being affected the most. It is expected that there will be a tragic drop in farm incomes this financial year. In fact, at the Outlook Conference it was interesting to note the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics December review forecast that the reduction this year would probably amount to a figure of 68 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter what basis we use for looking at these figures. Anybody in this place who has any connection with the rural constituency would know that all broad-acre farmers will probably be facing situations where the average income for each family labour unit will be about $5,500 this year. Yet many of these people have millions of dollars invested in the assets of their land and their years and years of activity. It is certainly a dismal and dreadful time to reflect on. </PARA>
<PARA> The abysmal record of the Labor Government in reducing input costs is one that needs to be very seriously addressed. Our labour market, the waterfront, transport systems, coastal shipping and taxes are too costly for exporters and for those who are competing against imports. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also noted the comments of the National Farmers Federation and, in particular, a series of studies that was prepared for the NFF in December 1990. A very detailed study was carried out by consultants on behalf of the NFF, looking at the flaws in government industry assistance at the present time and looking at the Industry Commission's methodology in determining levels of industry assistance, which has been and is seriously flawed. The Director of Policy of the NFF, Mr Garry Goucher, in releasing the internal NFF report, said that recognising the flaws within the Industry Commission's methodology would have a major impact on future programs of micro-economic reform. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In essence, the Commission has failed to recognise that agricultural industries are being penalised by inefficiencies in other sectors in the economy, particularly in the transport, irrigation, financial services and electricity industries. </PARA>
<PARA>The rate of assistance, or the aggregate effect of Government intervention, in industries such as sugar, rice, dairy and dried fruits, is much lower than is indicated by the Commission's current methodology. </PARA>
<PARA>Inefficiencies in key support services have resulted in major cost burdens on our efficient export industries, yet, the Commission has ignored their impact.</PARA>
<PARA>NFF is calling on the Industry Commission to change the methodology it uses when calculating effective rates of industry assistance so that all industries are treated equally. </PARA>
<PARA>In reviewing the legislation before us today, I note that the Opposition supports the legislation; however, I stress that it is time that the Labour Government woke up to its responsibilities and supported the industries that have contributed to Australia's international trade to keep this country on its feet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the Australian Democrats will not be opposing the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990 and the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill 1990, mainly because we understand they have support from both the industry and the Opposition, we think that in some way that support could be described as somewhat misguided. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in his second reading speech made mention of the fact that the Commonwealth now recovers all costs of collection. This package of Bills adds to the process by which the costs of collection, as well as the levies which are collected, are increasingly being borne, as Senator Tambling has mentioned, by the producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concept of user pays is one which sounds simple, but it is very hard to come to grips with in these industries. We have the question: who are the users of these services provided as a result of these levies and charges? Are the users the producers? Are they the consumers? Are they the traders in the commodities which are produced in primary industries? Then there is the question of who actually does pay. On the surface it is the producers who seem to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we should ask where the money comes from. The only place it can eventually come from is the consumers. Then we have the question of who benefits. Our first reaction is to say that the consumers benefit, but, obviously, the producers benefit from research, health inspections and improved products. Also, the community as a whole benefits from assurances that we are then able to give about public health matters, the eradication of diseases and the research which leads to better industry practices and better products. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that the whole community benefits from what is done with these levies and charges. Therefore, in the Australian Democrats opinion, it is a truism of the whole country that the Government should be contributing, and contributing more than is presently contributed. It is not a burden which is borne by a single sector of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government seems keen to allow burdens to accrue to our primary producers. There is a consistent policy being applied throughout the rural sector-the policy of removal of government assistance and support and the imposition of government charges, fees and taxes in such a way that exemptions or variations are difficult to obtain. This policy is often mistakenly described as deregulation, a level playing field, free trade or some such other euphemism. We reject that notion. Our competitors in primary industries throughout the world are assisted by their governments. They have comparative advantages, or disadvantages, and they are levelled by taxation, policies or subsidies by our competitors. They are competitors who have devised methods of looking after their rural producers, so our nation will be disadvantaged terribly unless we match them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is stupidity, even arrogant stupidity, to suggest that we should lead the way in shedding our support systems. If the rest of the world follows, that might be sort of all right. But, even if some of the rest of the world does not follow us, then we are sunk and that is where we are going right now. In this regard I agree with an observation made by the honourable member for Maranoa, Mr Scott, who said in another place that right now is the wrong time to be doing this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe we should be encouraging rather than discouraging by levies and taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>He meant encouraging primary industry. Of course, when levies and charges are applied there is a responsibility to use those charges for the benefit of the industry from which they are collected. I draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that one particular use to which such funds could be put is the control of the `disease' of foreign owned feedlots. Surely the fact that 2,683 cattle recently died from heat stress at the Whyalla feedlot, operated near Texas in Queensland by Nippon Ham Ltd, is important enough to move us to agree with the Queensland Government in its request for some national guidelines to be formulated, and quickly, for the operation of such feedlots. That is the sort of issue which needs national action for the benefit of our primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I only hope that such national action is helped and not hindered by the passage of these Bills which I must grudgingly admit are a worthwhile attempt to rationalise and make more efficient the collection of those charges and fees which are collected. Nevertheless, we will not be voting against this legislation; we will be supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to say a few words on the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990 and the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill 1990 on the resumption of the second reading debate. There are a few points that I will make. First, it is rather indecent that we are debating in the Senate today a Bill on levies and charges on primary industry when, at the same time, the end of the floor price scheme is being announced in the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Primary industry is in a great deal of stress and crisis at the moment. The wool industry has collapsed and with it will go many hundreds, if not thousands, of growers when this change is brought into place in the wool industry. Of course, we have also got to think that the grain growing industry is not in any better shape than the wool industry. Rural service industries are closing down and banks are pressing payments of outstanding debts, yet this Government is making no apologies for what it has done to all Australians but most especially to rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill claims to make more efficient the collection of various charges and it brings together 30 Acts to bring about this efficiency. It includes the export inspection charges. The meat and inspection system in this country is an absolute rort. As Mr Lloyd, the shadow Minister for primary industries said in the other place, `It has a lot to answer for'. There has been featherbedding, with inspectors living in towns in which there are no abattoirs but having to be paid in any case for doing no work. I know that representation has been made about that to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to try to fix up what seems to be an absolute anomaly. I understand that there are some 70 meat inspectors in New South Wales who do not actually do any work basically, except turn up occasionally at an abattoir to say that they are still on the payroll. </PARA>
<PARA> At other abattoirs there is pressure for a 68 per cent increase in wages and increased staff levels when there is no ample evidence that there ought to be any further inspectors. In fact, in most cases I believe there should be a lot fewer inspectors. They are claiming that even though they are not especially highly trained, they want something like $64,000 or $65,000 per year for the job of meat inspecting. It is very important to inspect our meat, of course, but we want productivity. We want the meat inspection part of our industry to be highly efficient, to be productive and to make sure that it does not put imposts onto our export industries that we do not need. We have also the Government vets in abattoirs who want $93,000 for a five-day week, but if one really looks at the job they have to do, one finds that it is not all that difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also the grain inspectors who want $86 an hour. That is not a bad wage-maybe it is an ambit claim-but here again it is obviously another cost on the rural industry. How can any industry, much less rural industry, afford to pay costs and charges like that? The Federal Government has said that rural industry should meet its own costs, and it is prepared to do that. But what industry can afford rates like the rates that I have just mentioned?</PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing about it? It talks about workplace reform but does nothing. In the meantime, rural industries are going down the gurgler all over the place. Farmers are resilient though. I am a farmer myself-and I just noticed that Senator Panizza has come into the chamber and he is a farmer-and he and I know that, no matter how resilient the farming community is in the future, it is nearly at the end of its tether at present. When good young people on the land are being pushed to the brink of economic insolvency, when other people in the industry-for example, the inspectors whom I have just talked about-are claiming that they want more wages and when the people who are working their guts out on the farms see these other people getting higher salaries, it is a big worry for the future of rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> What is killing rural industries, and will eventually kill them completely, is the continual mismanagement of the Australian economy. There has been mismanagement in terms of high interest rates. Last week we heard about inflation rates. Look what inflation has done. Look at how it compares with the rates of our competitors around the world. There has been a quarterly increase of some 2.7 per cent, which is absolutely astronomical. We have a dollar rate which is too high to enable our Australian farmers to compete around the world. We have had eight years now of the Hawke Labor Government and it is time that a little bit of notice was taken of the problems out in the rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA> We have towns, villages and, indeed, country cities that are under a great deal of stress at the moment because of what is happening in rural communities. High interest rates have permeated right through the system. High input costs to the farms are now there to stay. Those costs have been basically bolstered by high interest rates. In fact, high interest rates have stayed with us too long. They may have been used to dampen the economy but they have been imposed for too long and have now permeated all country areas. I am afraid they are going to sound the death knell for a lot of people. </PARA>
<PARA> Labour costs are up because of the high cost of capital and as a result of high interest rates and economic mismanagement. That ends up meaning one less employee or one less shop in country towns. If one walks around some of the country towns now one does not even see `For Sale' signs up because nobody wants to buy the shops which are closing down as a result of being screwed to the wall by this high interest rate regime that has been with us for the last few years. When we get to the stage of one less village or one less town, maybe a little bit of notice will be taken. In fact, it is time that the Government woke up. </PARA>
<PARA> We support this legislation. It is a change that I presume and hope will bring about the economies that it says it will. I say to the government of the day here in the federal capital that if rural Australia goes to the wall, all Australia goes to the wall. The standard of living of all Australians will be adversely and severely affected if this Government does not wake up very soon to things like labour market reform. We need to have productivity and competence. People need to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. All Australians will need to put their shoulders to the wheel to make sure that we get out of the economic mess that we have been led into in the last eight years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990 and the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill 1990 I would like to bring out a number of points which are of concern. I will do so even though the Opposition supports the legislation. I certainly support most of the principles behind the Bills. But at this time one must, as previous speakers have done, comment on the difficult situation that many people in rural industries now find themselves in. I refer here not only to the producers but also to country businesses and supporting industries that extend to the cities. In particular I want to raise the change of direction of the Government's position in terms of the sharing of responsibilities for paying levies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can support the user pays principle and it is important that all those who benefit from certain actions-I particularly refer to meat inspection levies-should share the cost. Currently, the responsibility for all costs ultimately falls back onto the producer. These costs should be passed down the price chain. It is important to note that producers are price takers, not price makers. There are two groups particularly in the community who will benefit from changes which are being made at the expense of primary producers-firstly, consumers and, secondly, the exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important point that needs to be made in terms of our export industries and charges, the meeting of Department of Primary Industries and Energy standards and the requirements of our international customers, is that there is also a national benefit. As such, I believe it is fair that there should be a national contribution. In terms of the user pays concept, we have now reached the stage where the user is subsidising others in the community to pay for something that is of national benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw attention to a couple of clauses in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill which cause me some concern. Clause 18 deals with the overpayments which are not the mistake of the producer from whom they are collected. While there is provision for repayment of the monies that have been overpaid, there is no provision in terms of the costs incurred by that producer, nor is there any provision as far as lost interest is concerned. I believe that is an anomaly in the Bill that needs addressing. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to clause 12(1) which I find a total contradiction; indeed, I believe it goes beyond fair and reasonable play. Under the heading `Industry consultation', clause 12(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA>12. (1) Before entering into an agreement under subsection 10 (1) . . . the Secretary is to consult with any industry body that is representative of producers of collection products, or intermediaries in relation to producers of collection products, who have an interest in relation to the proposed agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>Subclause (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA>(2) A failure to comply with subsection (1) does not invalidate the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is the situation which exists, one must ask the question: why have it there in the first place? It seems to me that if the direction is in subsection (2), there should be a requirement that that consultation does take place. If this Bill is to work how we want it to work from an industry point of view, it is important that consultation is made a requirement of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill. I wish to highlight two points in particular. In the past, the collection has primarily been made to counter the problems encountered in respect of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign (BTEC). This Bill proposes to use the moneys collected also on other diseases. From what I can ascertain, there has been no consultation with industry in terms of the expansion proposed by this Bill. One asks why at this time it is proposed to expand the types of diseases for which the levy is being collected. As I understand it, the BTEC levy was put in place for a specific purpose. We believed that when those diseases had been eradicated, the levy would not continue to be collected. I believe that there are some serious questions that need to be asked about the methodology in terms of that. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to my next point on this matter. I think that there will be some $23m in the fund by December 1992. This figure will increase beyond that, naturally, with the collection of additional levies. I ask: what is the safety net for that fund remaining where it is? I raise this as I am concerned with what has occurred in New South Wales, which I hope will not become a forerunner for other industry-collected levies. In this particular case, it was the pig industry. At the end of that research activity, the surplus of the fund was taken into Consolidated Revenue. It seems to me that there needs to be some safeguards for the collection of these levies. When they reach a certain time and their task is finished, they cannot be picked up and taken into Consolidated Revenue. I would like a commitment from the Government that it is not its intention to do that because, as I have said, that precedent has already been established in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving away from the specifics of this Bill, I would like to highlight some of the points that have been raised. Some of the previous speakers have made this point relative to the industry and inspection charges, et cetera. I do this not in the context of the blow-out or the excessive costs that I believe exist in many of these inspection charges and the way they are handled, but in the context of what is currently occurring in the meat industry in Australia and the disputation that has continued, particularly in Victoria and to a lesser extent in other States, with the absolute defiance of `the umpire'-to quote Senator Cook's favourite words-the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). I will refer to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the costs involved. The charge for a meat inspector for a five-day week is $64,686 per year, and the charge for a veterinarian is $92,428. I believe that it is time we looked very seriously at privatising some of these operations and putting them on a contract basis. I am sure that we could introduce much cheaper costs, which would assist us in becoming international competitors and we would become more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States the cost of processing beef is 10c per kilogram, yet in Australia it is 45c per kilogram. These costs are affecting our industries, particularly our export industries. We find ourselves with costs and charges that are three, four, or five times higher than those of our international competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the movement towards the user pays concept, which I have talked about before, there needs to be much greater accountability in terms of the efficiency and performance of the people who are given these particular tasks. I will give an example of a meat inspector in an abattoir in Victoria recently: the role of one of the people there-we are paying him through grower levies which were applied-consisted of being at the freezer works, or the storage facilities, in the morning to open the doors. He then filled in his whole day waiting for the evening so that he could shut and lock them again. In between he effectively did nothing at all. This type of inefficiency exists in the industry. At least some of the levies that are talked about in these Bills go towards paying for these types of operations. There must be a better and much more efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just run through a few points on the meat industry. On a number of occasions in this place before I have outlined some of the wastage that has occurred because of the industrial disputation in the meat industry. I do not intend to go over these figures again, but I will draw the attention of the Senate to a number of things which have occurred in recent times. I refer to a statement of 3 December by the Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The industrial action in the meat industry has been in breach of ACTU/AMIEU assurances given to the Commission in the meat industry inquiries proceedings and has been in breach of the AMIEU no-extra claims commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>Approximately one week later, the Deputy President, Joe Riordan, gave a direction to the AMIEU that it should desist from further industrial action while this matter was before the Industrial Relations Commission and while the Harrison inquiry was proceeding. I have the document here. We find the signature of Bill Kelty with the explanatory notes alongside it-in fact supporting and urging others to support the AMIEU and to defy the direction of the Deputy Commissioner, Mr Riordan. In the situation that exists in the meat industry now the ACTU is held up high by people on the other side of the chamber as being the great reasoner, the upholder of a sane, sensible industrial relations system in this country which believes in fair play. This situation actually defies the current position. I get rather emotional about this because this industry has the capacity to make a wonderful and very important contribution to the welfare of this country and will enable us to export and overcome some of our problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see the Government start to get serious about its continual references to upholding the umpire's decision. That is fine, but when only one side obeys the umpire, it is time that the whole system was looked at. Quite clearly, the system that exists with the meat industry at present has failed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills before us today will impose costs, for the benefit of the industry, back on producers. Much of that money is going down the drain through sheer industrial lawlessness. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I have commented on what I see as some of the anomalies in these Bills, which are being debated cognately. I would like to hear the Government's view on the points I have made, particularly in relation to consultation with the industry. Unless these anomalies are corrected, these Bills will have to come before us again as they will not be worth the paper they are written on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I rise to address briefly the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill 1990 and add my support to the points made by my colleagues Senator Brownhill and Senator Crane. I understand that this Bill brings together 30 Acts by which inspection and research levies were previously collected. This will mean that we will not need to deal with 30 amendment Bills coming into the Senate over the next year or so in different ways and means. I believe it was a good idea to bring all these pieces of legislation together and, as pointed out by the two previous speakers, our side of politics will certainly support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988 the Department of Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) commenced charging for collecting inspection fees. I am not exactly sure what the Department is charging for the collection of these fees, but I hope that it is no more than the 2.5 per cent charged to unions by the Department of Finance for collecting their membership fees from weekly pay packets. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest collection under this Bill is about $172m, which comes from the meat inspection fee. Madam Acting Deputy President, you may recall that the upsurge in more efficient inspection of export meat was caused by the fiasco that occurred in Australia about three or four years ago, which was caused by the excessive use of certain pesticides, now banned, which were detected in meat sent to the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has by steps increased what it collects for inspection charges. At one time it was a 50 per cent charge, but it has gradually been increased and now lies at 100 per cent. But I ask: 100 per cent of what? It does not seem to be 100 per cent of the actual work being done. It seems to be 100 per cent of what is done, of the training of those meat inspectors, of the vehicles they drive-and probably drive for other purposes, including private purposes a lot of the time-and of all the infrastructure and site resources which go into putting those people into employment with the DPIE. We are being charged 100 per cent and that fee is ever rising. </PARA>
<PARA> The two previous speakers pointed out a few figures. For example, a meat inspector is on a salary of $64,846. I do not want to decry the job of a meat inspector, but I do not think that figure is quite commensurate with the standard of education needed to be a meat inspector. A meat inspector can qualify with 12 months part time TAFE study, and I understand that has not changed in the past few years. The salary paid to meat inspectors is certainly higher than the salaries paid to anyone on this side of the chamber in a year. Ministers get more than that figure, but it certainly puts meat inspectors on a higher salary than the members on this side of the chamber and meat inspectors work only five days a week from, I believe, 7.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. Therefore, I think they are slightly overpaid. </PARA>
<PARA> Veterinarians, who are far more highly educated and who are working in a far more competitive environment, are paid an average of $92,428 for a five-day week working those same hours. Although veterinarians working in normal practices around Australia are highly educated, I am afraid that is not a figure for running their own businesses and meeting their own upkeep and business costs; it is a figure I know that the average veterinarian does not get. I have a few friends who are in that profession; I know of one particular veterinarian who used to be a lecturer at the School of Veterinary Science at Murdoch University in Western Australia and I can assure honourable senators that she is on half that figure and probably works twice as long. Of course, she has the added burden and work of teaching young students and seeing them successfully through university. So I consider that, for the hours meat inspectors work in abattoirs and wherever else they do their inspections, they could be slightly overpaid. Their salary, for example, puts them virtually into the category of the pay of a Minister. I do not see Senator Tate disagreeing with my assumption, so we will presume that a Minister's pay is around that level. I believe the industry is overloaded with costs with which it should not have to contend. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the sorts of figures which we, the industries, are bound to pay-I say `we' because I am in all those sorts of industries; that is, cattle, sheep and wheat- we have been put beyond the scope of competing with overseas trading partners. It has been mentioned time and time again in this chamber that it costs $13 a head to put sheep on the hook in Australia, whereas in America it can be done for $5 a head. That is why one cannot give sheep away. It is all very well to say, `Shoot the sheep and give them to the poor', but someone has to find that $13 to put the sheep onto the hook. Of course, from the hook the sheep have to be moved down the line to where the poor people can get them. We cannot do anything other than find that money or carry on with the situation as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been talk of putting these sheep into cans and shipping them to Third World countries. Another great idea! Even if one gave them away, it would cost about $19 to put a sheep in a can-one would not put one sheep in one can; one would put pieces of it in one can. In Australia that is beyond us. It costs nearly $120 to put cattle on the hook, whereas in America it can be done for about $40. We have to get the cost down if the industries here are to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure you spoke on the cattle transaction levy Bill when it went through this chamber a few months ago. I certainly spoke quite strongly on that legislation. Honourable senators may remember that the Bill removed the onus for paying a slaughter levy from the processors at an abattoir back to the owner and spread it around so that a certain amount stayed with the processor but the bulk went back to the producer of the animals, and so forth. It was also extended to every cattle transaction, whether to the processor or from farm to farm or station to station. </PARA>
<PARA> With the processor having been relieved of at least $8, or thereabouts, on one head of cattle in the processing, one would have expected, when the time came to change over from the old to the new system-which I understood was two weeks ago-that that would be reflected in the market at auctions. I have made some contacts with the selling centre in Goulburn in New South Wales-I think another one is at Dubbo; certainly I have contacted Midland Junction in Western Australia-and I have found that there was not an ounce of movement upwards; there is certainly an ounce of movement downwards but there was no movement upwards. I expected that on cattle one would get at least $8 extra because it was removed from the processor to the producer, but that money was not there. We can put this legislation through Parliament on that basis; one can say, `Okay, we are moving the onus of paying for a certain transaction from the processors to the producers but they should be recompensed'. The producer will get the heavier load; the processor has not done his job by paying the extra which he reckoned he was saddled with in the first place and which should therefore belong to the producer. I just use that as an example of how all the imposts in primary industry finish up with the producer. </PARA>

I believe that most people know what the situation in the bush is, but in case all members of the Senate have not finally realised it, I will give them a brief rundown. I have been right around the southern half of Western Australia since 1 January to see how primary producers are faring. I also attended all the rural crisis meetings in Western Australia in November and December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1 January it has got through to the people exactly what the price of wheat will be in the bank to the primary producer. It is about $50 a tonne less than last year. In Western Australia the average going into the farmer's bank would be around the $70 mark, depending on the freight component. Added to this, we have the total collapse of the wool market, and even the suspension of that market that we have had for three weeks to enable us to iron out a system that was allowed to go wrong-caused to go wrong to a great extent-by the Wool Corporation of Australia, assisted by the Australian Wool Council and aided and abetted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). </PARA>
<PARA> I did not criticise the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, on that matter at least, virtually until the last couple of weeks. Just prior to Christmas he gave a guarantee to wool buyers around the world, including Japan and Italy, that the price of 700c per kilo was ironclad for the next two years. I do not quite know why he went on such a mission telling them that. It was probably to get the wool moving, but it has certainly backfired. I hope that he did not know that it would backfire as badly as it has since then. </PARA>
<PARA> The woolgrowing industry having been led into such a position by the Corporation, aided and abetted by the Minister, I would have thought that the Government would have come up with some scheme to isolate the stockpile under certain conditions. That has not quite been forthcoming. A Bill relating to that matter will come before the Senate later this week, so I will reserve my further remarks along that line until then. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Opposition supports this legislation for the better workings of the collection of these levies. However, I hope that any benefits that result from the more efficient collection of the levies will be passed back to the grower, as has not been the case with the transaction levy, so that producers receive a benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating three rural Bills which consolidate the collection charges levied by the Federal Government and the consequential amendments to other Acts that flow from the consolidation of these Bills. The Opposition will support them because, in a sense, they are purely a housekeeping measure; they do not change anything. However, one is driven to comment on how these Bills illustrate the huge cost impost on rural producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People tend to think that rural producers somehow or other live idyllic lives free from the stresses of the urban environment and once or twice a year bring their products into town, having had no costs in producing those products. But the reality of the situation today is that there are now enormous costs on the rural producer. The very sobering impact of the Bills before us is the great swag of charges that the Federal Government now imposes on rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not the end of it. The Government imposes many indirect charges on rural producers and, of course, the State governments-particularly the Labor State governments-are in there, boots and all, socking it to the poor old rural producer, who in most cases is simply not in a position to pass on charges. A restaurant can charge a good unionist a little more for a steak sandwich when he is working a 32- or 33-hour week; that is fine. He just applies for a wage rise, but there are no wage rises possible for rural producers, who have to sell their products, in the main, on the international markets in competition with the other nations of this world. There is a very good discipline that could be imposed on the economy to control costs within the country to keep rural products competitive. That is important to Australia, because about 40 per cent of our export earnings, meagre though they are, come from the activities of our rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Bill consolidates the collection charges that previous speakers have referred to-the cattle slaughter levy and such things. The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Bill deals with the consequential amendments to 30 different pieces of legislation. As I said, it is sobering to reflect now on the range of charges that the Federal Government imposes on the rural industry and to look back a decade ago, when most of those charges did not exist. If they did exist, they were very nominal. The final Bill is the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills impose no new taxes. The Government puffs itself up and says, `That is good; they are revenue neutral', but the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in his second reading speech cannot deny the fact that these Bills are before us as a result of the outcry of the industry at the charges. As he says in the second reading speech, they are a housekeeping measure to try to bring some order to the system that exists at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I said before that 40 per cent of Australia's export earnings come from rural industry. It is still a very large industry in Australia. It ranks with the mining industry, which has a slightly higher figure, as the principal export earning sector in the Australian economy. In 1988-89 the rural industry was valued at $22 billion. There are 165,000 farms in Australia. Most of those are family farms, only about 5 per cent being owned by public or private companies. The industry directly employs nearly 400,000 Australians, and those 400,000 Australians contributed nearly $15.5 billion in export earnings last year. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the basic facts of life that are not appreciated by the Australian Labor Party, being a Party composed of union officials and the odd minor solicitor and minor schoolteacher, is the fact that when rural Australia is doing well the whole of Australia is doing well, and when rural Australia is in depression the whole of Australia is in depression. That has been an inviolate rule of Australia for the whole of our history. It therefore follows that all the nonsense that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) might talk when he dissembles over the latest figures for the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, the balance of payments and all the rest of it, and all the mickey mouse schemes such as the J-curve, going back to the start of the present Hawke Labor disaster, do not really matter if rural Australia is in depression. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that now, through a conjunction of events-a surplus on overseas markets, subsidies for overproduction in the European Community and to some degree in the United States of America, and, most importantly, the cost pressures we have now loaded on the Australian producer-the Australian rural economy is in depression. </PARA>

<PARA> At present the rural sector is in a very big depression. The three big export earners-wool, wheat and beef-are in trouble. The wool market and the wheat market are in crisis and the beef market is not looking too good, and we have quite a lot of problems on the horizon. There are three broad areas which contribute to our high costs. There is the fact that world commodity prices are down. We have had a number of climatic instances, particularly in my State of Queensland, where about half the State is under water at the moment. That has had a devastating effect on stock, particularly in the cattle industry, as well as on the sugar industry, which is another significant export earner. </PARA>
<PARA> The final problem is the cost pressures imposed on the industry, many of which relate to the Government. There are the high interest rates, the high cost of fuel and the high cost of inflation. I will deal with them briefly. The Government has been spending more money that it earns. In all the years since 1983, since it came in to power, its policy has been to have a high interest rate regime to attract money into the country. But this is utterly devastating for small business and rural producers in many ways. Although they might have assets or nominal assets that run up into the many hundreds of thousands, and sometimes into the millions, they are small businesses and they need overdrafts to survive. In the past they have paid figures in excess of 20 per cent and 25 per cent. This adds enormously to their operating costs. To go off on a tangent, clause 15(3) (c) of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Bill states that, if someone defaults in paying these accounts to the Commonwealth, the rate of interest levied by the Commonwealth is 2 per cent per month. In simple English, that represents 24 per cent a year. It is now enshrined in the legislation that anyone who defaults on payment of his or her account to the Commonwealth will pay 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The first time that I bought a house-Senator Tate can smile, but it is a real bloodsucking operation-I had to pay 7 per cent, and I thought 7 per cent was blatant usury. But now enshrined in Commonwealth legislation is the fact that, if the poor old rural producer who probably has to wait six to 12 months before he can sell his cattle or get his sugar, wheat or some other crop in, cannot meet his bill, he is in for 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That this has been done says a great deal about the Government's lack of knowledge of the industry. It also says a great deal about the Government's expectations. That small figure of 2 per cent per month shows that, first, it does not have the courage to write it up as 24 per cent per annum and that, secondly, it expects that, for the rest of its tenure on the treasury bench, inflation and interest rates will be running at a level that makes its charge of 24 per cent look compatible. I do not need to say any more on that point when it is spelled out in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other great costs for the rural industry is fuel, which is enormously dear. It is true that rural producers qualify for the diesel rebate scheme and they are grateful for that, but that is only part of the equation. Fuel is a factor in pretty well everything that happens in Australia. We are a huge country with a low density population. Our manufacturing centres are well removed, by and large, from the rural producing areas. The cost of fuel and transport is factored into everything we buy. Everything a rural producer buys has a very significant fuel component. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Gulf crisis started the cost of fuel in Australia was twice what it was in the United States. As the United States is getting its fuel from the Gulf and it is paying the same price per barrel as we are, there is no reason for Australia's fuel to be so expensive other than the rapacious taxes being put on it through fuel excise by this Government. But it has got a lot worse than that. Since the Gulf crisis, we have been paying pump prices about 60 per cent to 70 per cent higher-depending on where the fuel is bought-than they were before the Gulf crisis. Yet the price of fuel-the cost per barrel on the international market-is lower today than it was six months ago when the Gulf crisis started. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going on here? Why has the Government not moved in and done something to control those prices? We have not seen any significant erosion from the peak prices of fuel at the pump since the Gulf crisis. There might have been a 6c or 8c reduction in the cost per litre, but there is no way at all that the price of fuel today is what it was before the Gulf crisis started. </PARA>
<PARA> The only justification that anyone can advance for that is the fact that there has been a marginal increase in exchange rates, which makes the fuel slightly dearer for us to buy, but that does not mathematically go anywhere near explaining what is going on. The Government should certainly look at its Trades Practices Act. It should stop the monopoly that the oil companies, the refiners, have in tying houses. It should generate a free market so that any retailer can sell fuel bought from any producer within Australia or even overseas, so that we get a bit of real competition in the marketplace. If that happens, we will see a degree of moderation in the charges being applied to rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only fuel that is the problem; it is everything that flows from the petrochemical industries. Plastics have an important place in rural production with polythene piping and all the rest of it. Petroleum feed stock for that matter is now very expensive. Again, it has gone up in price. We will not see the cost of polythene piping come down. We will not see the cost of paint come down. Again, this works off petroleum feed stock. These things have a major impact on rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other great economic problems for the rural producer has of course been the effect of inflation-one of the living legacies of the mismanagement during the Whitlam years. Now, nearly 20 years after those fools were on the treasury bench we are still ingrained with very high inflation. The expectation in all branches of industry-whether rural, manufacturing or anything else-is that each year, each month and each week one has to add factor something into one's prices to cope with inflation. We are in a self-perpetuating mode there. Of course, the Government is again right at the heart of this. It loves bracket creep. It loves to see inflation increase so that people's salaries go up as a consequence and it gets more and more taxation each year in a very dishonest way. One of the great disciplines the Government could impose would be to index its taxation take from the community so that it is not a beneficiary of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other great cost imposts comes from the Government's labour practices-its absolute reluctance, inability and obdurate approach to cleaning out the labour practices; its inability to take on the trade unions and get some productivity out of the work force. There are hundreds of thousands of Australians who are prepared to do a good day's work for a good day's pay. I was pleased to hear Mr Howard yesterday call for a return to the 40-hour week and for the removal of all those fringe benefits. I hope that becomes a reality. We simply cannot go on drifting and dreaming our way through the world, paying ourselves more to do less than other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The example that Senator Brownhill gave the other day was very salutary. He stated that these work practices affect just one part of the industry-the cattle industry. He quoted the labour costs of just slaughtering and packing a beast-in Australia, $111; in the United States, $36 and, in Uruguay, $56. </PARA>
<PARA> When one adds in all the other costs, one finds that it costs $193 to slaughter and get a beast right through the abattoir, from the moment it turns up at the gate to when it goes out in a cardboard carton-$193 in Australia, $88 in the United States and $82 in Uruguay. I am a beef producer myself, and when we sell beef on the export market we do not get any compensation from the purchasers-whether they are in Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea or Japan-because it costs us $193 to process that beast as against $82 in Uruguay. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason for that other than the union-ridden practises in the abattoirs. If we had an incentive payments scheme, if we got rid of all of Senator Cook's mates who just want a free ride on the community and if we had workers who are prepared to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, we could meet that cost of killing and the cost of production of that beef. Until we clear up those things, we have a very bleak future on the export market. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be remiss of me not to refer to the way the State governments are also in on the act regarding rural producers. In my own State of Queensland we have the misfortune to have a Labor Government. The very first act of the Queensland transport Minister was to put up the cost of registering farm trucks by about 180 to 200 per cent. Most of those trucks spend the greater part of their working lives being used on the properties themselves and rarely go on the main roads. It is true that they do go on the main roads, but their primary purpose is transport within the boundaries of the properties. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to have trucks if one is running a decent farm, cattle property, sheep property or wheat property. There is no other way out of it. There has been a very reasonable tariff set on registration in the past. Now we find that the Queensland Government has whipped it up almost 200 per cent. We will find this year, when the registration renewals come out, that it will go up five or 10 per cent, but it will be compounded on that much higher base. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week the Queensland Government again hiked up the electricity charges very savagely. Again, rural producers have very high power costs. The connection of power to rural properties is an enormously expensive business. It may cost $6,000 or $8,000, if one is lucky, but more than likely it might be $30,000 or $35,000 to have power put on a property, depending on where it is sited. What is worse, once that power is connected, in most of the Queensland rural areas one has to sign a contract that for X number of years one will buy $5,000 worth of power, or something, from the electricity company. Any increase, as the Labor Government in Queensland has made, on that basic unit rate for power unfairly hits the rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The only glimmer of joy in the whole business, I suppose, is the fact that we do not have the Democrats in government. Such a situation would be even bleaker still for the rural producers because there would be the reintroduction of death duties on properties over $300,000, a Federal land tax scheme would be introduced and we would see capital gains tax ratchetted to higher levels. Of course, we would go back to the Stone Age with respect to controlling weed and pest infestation because we would find that all chemicals used on a farm would be totally taxed out of existence. There would be the abolition of the live sheep export trade and, of course, the lives of anyone in the pastoral industry would be utter misery because the most extreme claims of the animal liberation lobby would be written into the Democrats' policies. Fortunately, we do not have to reflect on that for too long because they will never be in power. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very heartened over the weekend to read a commentator in one of the Sunday papers who said that he thought Robert Menzies was the greatest Prime Minister we have ever had, which is a feeling I have always shared with millions of other Australians. He argued that Menzies was the greatest Prime Minister we have ever had because he let Australians get on with their lives. These Bills illustrate the wisdom of that sentiment. Let us allow Australians to get on with their own lives. Let us get the Government, with its huge raft of taxes, off our backs-taxes which, by and large, do very little in a positive or constructive way; taxes and levies which, by and large, only provide income for people who simply do not want to do an honest day's work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not oppose the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill. However, we have a number of concerns about the Bill and believe that in many respects it is unnecessary and introduces a number of highly regulatory procedures which could be done without the necessity of legislation. This Bill gives legislative force to what we see as a monolithic structure. Also, it is a long piece of legislation which in many aspects only gives effect to the common law liabilities which employers have to employees. There is also the question of the additional cost to the Government in putting in place legislation of this kind. Furthermore, the duplication between Commonwealth and State administration will be given greater emphasis by this legislation. Those are our principal criticisms of this Bill, which I shall deal with in more detail in the course of my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, despite those criticisms the Opposition will not be opposing the legislation. However, the Opposition is opposed to one of the three pillars of the Government's policy on occupational health and safety. Indeed, this is the third pillar which has been erected by the Commonwealth on this subject. The first Bill brought in by the Government introduced Worksafe, which set up the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. The second piece of legislation introduced by this Government established Comcare, which was an updated version of Commonwealth employees' compensation and with which I shall not deal now. The third piece of legislation puts in place a structure for Commonwealth employees and relates to liabilities placed on the Commonwealth as an employer. However, the Opposition believes that there is no necessity for the first of these pieces of legislation or for the new structures to which the Commonwealth has given effect. </PARA>
<PARA> On return to government we propose to abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. We see it as unnecessarily duplicating the legislative and administrative arrangements between the Commonwealth and States in this area. We also see it as involving unnecessary expenditures and as duplicating in many ways the roles of Commonwealth and State. Therefore, although we shall not vote against the Bill itself, I move:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA>``,but the Senate notes that the need for uniform national occupational health and safety standards has not been demonstrated; that the States and the Commonwealth are in the best place to determine their own needs; and that a future Liberal/National Government would abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and resume its functions within the Department''.</PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to some of the aspects of the legislation which, in the Opposition's view, offend much of the approach that we would favour on legislation and administration by the Commonwealth. There has been a growing tendency for many years, which seems to be accelerating under this Government, to churn out more and more legislation which adds virtually nothing to the requirements of good government or to the protection of people's rights and duties. It simply gives statutory form to and creates structures which only duplicate rights, procedures and institutions that already exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 of the Bill, in division 1, deals with the general duties relating to occupational health and safety and is a very good example of what I have been saying. The provision begins by stating:</PARA>
<PARA>An employer must take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety at work of the employer's employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cooney, who I understand will follow me in this debate-he is sitting patiently listening to me-will know that that has been the law of Australia for over 100 years. That law has been developed in a very sophisticated way over a long time. Yet here in this Bill we have pages restating not only the provisions as to that duty, but the duties of employers in relation to third parties, the duties of manufacturers in relation to plant and substances, the duties of suppliers, the duties of people erecting or installing plant in a workplace and so on. All these concepts come within the same category; namely, obligations which are being imposed on employers or on the various people concerned with occupational health and safety, as it is now called, and which is a modern buzz phrase. In fact, these matters have been working perfectly satisfactorily because these obligations have been developed over some years and relate to numerous instances as they have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> All these obligations are well and truly established. As I said, they are working, subject to development and application in new situations, but all this part of the legislation, pages of it, adds nothing whatsoever to the benefit of people who may be affected by having to use plant on their work premises which is supplied by the manufacturers. It is a well-known and fundamental principle of the common law that one has to take reasonable care in a general way in relation to one's neighbour, and there is also the clearly established obligation as part of the contractual relationship that applies between employer and employee that reasonable care should be taken. As I have said, a great deal of this legislation is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if we turn from that general criticism to look at the specific reason for this legislation, we see that that arises in part 3 of the Bill, which puts in place what are called workplace arrangements; that is, it sets up a system providing for the appointment of people who have responsibility for watching out, I guess, for possible dangers to health and safety. It provides for the setting up of designated work groups and the appointment of a health and safety representative for each of these designated work groups. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a laudable idea. Indeed, there is nothing that the Opposition is concerned about in relation to that. The Opposition only wonders why legislation is needed to do it. We are talking about the obligations of the Commonwealth Government as the employer. This is not imposing any obligation on employers generally; the Commonwealth is imposing these obligations on itself. One must ask why the Government needs legislation to do it. When all is said and done, the Commonwealth, as part of this new dawn of cooperative occupational and safety arrangements in which it has been seeking to give leadership through the Occupational Health and Safety Commission, presumably has been observing these principles, codes of practice, and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this is a perfectly laudable objective that the Opposition has no criticism of, one wonders why it needs legislation. When we ask ourselves that, we soon get the answer as to why this legislation is brought in. It is brought in because it gives unions a highly preferred position in this whole subject. When we study this legislation fully, we see that that is about the only reason for it. The Government has brought this legislation in to further enhance the power, the authority and the general busibodiness of unions in as many affairs of the nation as it thinks it can. That is where the Opposition's major criticism of this legislation resides. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are very much in favour of arrangements being entered into at the workplace. Enterprise agreements are matters that we want to encourage. Clearly, in matters of health and safety, we see very great merit in the employer and employees getting together and setting up, by agreement, a health and safety representative if one of the employees would take on this task. If more than one person was interested in that task, an election could be held which could be arranged by a suitable enterprise or workplace agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> But no, here the Government has erected a structure where, although it does not exclude that occurring, if there is a union involved the union has a preferred position under this legislation. An employee can be a candidate for this position where a union is involved only if he is nominated for the job by an involved union. When we have an election at the workplace for the position of health and safety representative, if a union is involved it is not open to any employee to put himself forward and say, `Look, I am the best person for this job'. He has to suck up to the union and get himself nominated by the union. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suppose that we should be surprised by this sort of legislation. With its accord, this Government, from day one when it came into power nearly eight years ago, has agreed with the union movement of Australia that the peak councils of that union movement will virtually have a seat at the Cabinet table and has placed the union movement in a highly preferred position as far as the government of this country is concerned. In many ways, this is a very minor extension of the powers that have been accorded to unions over the years during which this Government has been in power. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives a lot of powers to these health and safety representatives. If one of these people perceives that there is a health and safety problem and an immediate threat to health and safety, that representative, first of all, must inform a supervisor but, if he cannot find a supervisor immediately, he can direct an employee to cease working. This position is a very powerful one and that power is given to the representative by this legislation. The representative can do all sorts of other things, but nothing as effective as simply being able to stop work by any employee who he believes is in danger or is endangering health and safety. It is not a position which is there just to keep an eye on things to bring them to the attention of management; this legislation gives a very powerful position to that representative. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of concern to the Opposition about this whole question is that if this kind of structure is put in place, one would expect, and certainly one would hope, that it will put an end to industrial disputation on health and safety matters. As I have said, if this elaborate structure is created, if these very considerable powers are given and if this legislation is going to work, as presumably the Government thinks it is going to work-the Opposition may have some reservations about how effective it is going to be, but, obviously, the Government is not going to all this trouble unless it believes it is going to work-then we call upon the Government to make it very clear that it is not going to tolerate the use that has been made of such legislation by union representatives, particularly in the building industry, for so long whereby they create so-called health and safety issues to further their industrial policies. That has notoriously been the case in the building industry where lightning strikes have been pulled on on spurious health or safety grounds to achieve other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of this sort of legislation may be put in question because a similar type of legislation in Victoria certainly did not prevent the major industrial dispute and confrontation which occurred at the Hoechst factory last year. The Victorian Premier herself seemed to be encouraging what was clearly an abuse of legislation-the Victorian legislation in relation to this matter is very similar to the proposed legislation-and yet this was still pulled on. I believe that the Government ought to make clear that in its view this Bill should put an end to, and the Government itself will strongly support an ending of, this misuse of safety issues for industrial purposes by militant unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt at some length with the criticisms and concerns that the Opposition has about the Bill. It is going to add to direct government costs. One has to wonder whether that is money well spent despite the fact that it is a relatively small sum. Nevertheless, it is an issue that has to be noted. </PARA>
<PARA> Our third concern is the extent of Commonwealth involvement in health and safety matters which this Bill adds to. As I said, it is the third pillar in what has been a developing policy by the Commonwealth Government to get itself more involved in these issues. The Commonwealth now seems to be showing concern about the extent to which duplication of Commonwealth and State functions has been created-not only by this Government, I freely admit, but by successive governments in Australia-which, as I said earlier, certainly has been accelerated a great deal by this Government in the eight years in which it has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that there is no need, if we are still going to do something about that, to maintain the existence of a National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. There has been enough consultation and experience in this area now at the State level and at the Commonwealth level for there to be no need to continue another bureaucratic structure of that sort. It received in the latest Budget $15 million, of which half was spent on salaries for people to go around the countryside having conferences, programs, study groups, seminars and whatever. The Opposition believes that this is only adding to the costs of government in Australia and we believe that the time has come for that to be abolished. That is the basis on which the Opposition has moved this amendment, to add those views on this occasion when we are supporting, or at least not opposing, the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Durack has pointed out, there has been much law made in looking to the welfare of people in the workplace. Much of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill 1990 is the proper and natural outcome of much that has gone before. The nineteenth century workplace that people like Charles Dickens described in Hard Times has, hopefully, by and large gone. But there is much yet to do to ensure that people are able to work in a place that is safe and proper; safe not only in terms of the trauma that might be inflicted on them by unguarded machines or slippery floors, but also in terms of their psychological health, the health of their organs and their ability generally to go about their functions in a way that leaves their bodily and mental integrity sound. This is good legislation and it takes practical steps to ensure that the workplace is run in a proper and safe fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are three things that a good employer should provide for his, her or its employees; that is, safety in the workplace so that accidents are prevented; rehabilitation, if, unfortunately, an accident takes place; and income maintenance while a person is recovering. A significant clause of this Bill is clause 12 which refers to the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. It imposes certain obligations and entitlements on that Commission. The title of that Act indicates that it is concerned with two of the issues that I was talking about before; that is, rehabilitation and income maintenance. But the primary consideration of any employer should be the safety of the employee in the workplace, and that is what this legislation addresses. It does some very useful things besides. It obliges the Commission to collect, interpret and report information relating to occupational health and safety in Commonwealth employment and to formulate policies and strategies relating to the occupational health and safety of employees, amongst other things. </PARA>
<PARA> The emphasis that this Act gives to safety-this point cannot be repeated enough-is crucial. I say to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), who has finally brought this forth where other Ministers have not, that it is not before time that he and the Parliament have brought forward legislation such as this. I am glad to see it is here. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack has said that this legislation simply repeats what other law already contains. It does more than that. Clause 16, which Senator Durack properly referred to, takes tortious matters and attaches to them a criminal penalty. I have no doubt that the courts will apply these penalties properly and fairly, but it introduces the concept of the criminality of employers in failing to take proper care of the people who operate in their workplaces. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is an important step. It does several things. First of all, it ensures that employers will look to the safety of their employees, and the more people that are protected from a violation of their bodily, mental and psychological health, the happier the community. The social cost that comes about through injuries is horrific, the emotional cost is horrific and the cost to the family is horrific and, in my view, those costs are more important than the financial costs which, because of the nature of the parliamentary process, we tend to concentrate on in areas like this. True enough, the financial cost of accidents is a very important one to consider, but the others I have mentioned are perhaps more important. When this Bill becomes an Act and goes into operation, I think what we will find is that the social, emotional and family costs that I have talked about will be much reduced and the financial costs will be, too. This Bill perhaps has done more for the saving of expenditure in the workplace than many other ones that come before this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The next thing I want to turn to is the question of the unions that Senator Durack has raised. He said that this gives the unions an unfair prominence in the running of health and safety in the workplace. Can I just say this: if there is one area in which the unions have an obligation to act, it is in the area of health and safety. Unions came into operation to get a fair return for their members and then had to work against the combination Acts and so on, but one of the earlier issues that they had to face was this issue of safety. Safety was a long time coming to the workplace, and indeed the law was a long time coming in giving answers to that. It was only perhaps halfway through this century that the effects of common employment, of volenti, and of contributory negligence were modified by the courts. Indeed, courts were quite slow in responding to the needs of people who suffered grievously in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the great glories of the Parliaments, both here and in England, that they introduced legislation such as the fencing Act and those other Acts which imposed proper conduct upon employers by providing safety-in terms of physical safety-in the workplace. In that context, the unions are essential to give strength to employees who might face a grievous situation. For example, if somebody is working a word processing machine, there is danger of repetitive strain injury occurring because the seat is not at the proper level or the machine is not far enough away. I am just looking at Hansard here but there is no machine there at the moment that I can use as an illustration. But if that is the situation with a young lady of 18 or 19, it is expecting a lot of her to get up and complain to her employer that the seat is not appropriate. However, it is a different matter if she has got a union and a representative of the union can make that complaint on her behalf. I repeat that if there is any area in which a union should be and should be working effectively, it is in this area of health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack properly raised the issue that if a health and safety representative goes beyond his or her power, then problems can occur. This Bill under the close scrutiny of the Minister has seen to that and it is for that reason that clause 32 is inserted. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> 32. (1) An application for the disqualification of a health and safety representative for a designated work group may be made to the Commission by the employer of all the employees including in the designated work group, or by an involved union in relation to the designated work group, on one of both of the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that action taken by the representative in the exercise of purported exercise of a power under subsection 28 (1) or any other provision of this Act was taken:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) with the intention of causing harm to the employer or to an undertaking of the employer; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) unreasonably, capriciously or otherwise than for the purpose for which the power was conferred on the representative. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to meet the objection that was properly raised by Senator Durack. If there is no union some other person, who is not a member of the union, is elected. My view is that such a person is in a very weakened state because he or she has not got the backup that is so essential when meeting a body, such as the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom Australia has some power in the land. It has economic power of considerable proportions and, particularly now when people are looking for work, unless a particular employee had an ability to call on an institution such as a union to back up his or her position regarding a health issue, he or she is going to be in terrible trouble indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation would be the same with Australia Post. If a person is not given proper clothing or not given proper protection against the weather, it is almost an impossibility for that person to stand up for himself or herself. The same with the Commonwealth. I do not know whether the Department of the Senate would be so oppressive as to come down on the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, but I am sure that if they did she would be more than happy to have somebody back her up. So I think to criticise the unions in this particular concept is misconceiving the function of unions. One might talk about whether they operate appropriately in other areas but in this area of health and safety their need is essential. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is a matter of mechanism. As long as the union is there to back up the position that is taken by the representative, I do not suppose it matters whether it nominates him or not. But it seems to me that the mechanism that is set out in this Act is a useful one, as long as one has got a group willing to back up the position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We politicians, in a way, every now and then go into this union tendency, particularly when we are looking to raise our salaries-not so much to get what we do not deserve, of course, but to give a common answer to the objection that we get anything at all. We all, in various aspects of our lives, look for a backup and I suppose that is why we are members of a particular party. It is good to have people around when one is making points in this chamber. I oftentimes feel sorry for Senator Vallentine who sits there on her own. I am sure that she would more than welcome a few companions to back her up in what she does and that is essentially the function that a union performs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have perhaps spoken for longer than I had intended. But as we look at it, and I keep repeating, this is a piece of legislation which is essential in the development of the law which regulates the workplace. This is a big step. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to clause 23 because it gives government-the people concerned-the right to make regulations. I think that is important. In my view it is better to bring forward safety provisions by way of regulations rather than in the Act. The nature of the workplace and the dangers that occur in the workplace tend to change quite rapidly and it is proper that a fairly rapid means of answering those changes be provided. That is provided by clause 23 which gives power to make regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I congratulate the Minister and the Government for bringing forward this legislation. I think it will work, as similar legislation in Victoria has worked. The purpose of the scheme is really to give both employers and employees an opportunity for commenting upon the workplace, to prevent injuries that might otherwise have arisen, to give advice as to how hazards can be removed, and generally to save many people in the future from costs, whether those costs be social, financial, emotional or otherwise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill 1990. The purpose of the Bill in broad terms is to provide for the protection of the health and safety of Commonwealth employees at work. Senator Cooney has very adequately drawn attention to the historical significance of health and safety as a preoccupation of workers. I think he rightfully has acknowledged the role of unions in relation to this key issue and has cited it as being an area of specific, very precise focus of unions for decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill will impose on both employers and employees of the Commonwealth a duty of care and specific obligations which are similar to the obligations currently imposed on employers and employees by legislation which has been enacted by most of the Australian States. Commonwealth Government employees will now have similar protection to that which is presently enjoyed by both public and private sector employees in most States. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, it is a Bill of uniformity; it is a Bill which draws together fragmented patterns of legislation throughout the Commonwealth. In that respect, it is a Bill which is overdue. I join with Senator Cooney in congratulating the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the Government for finally drawing together this fragmented pattern of legislative cover. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill not only addresses obligations of employers and employees in relation to health and safety matters at work but it also addresses the consequences of injury at work in terms of compensation, rehabilitation and the other important human dimensions which flow from breaches of safety and health in the workplace. It does not pretend that it is possible to make all workplaces in every way healthy and safe. I think it would be folly for us to imagine that that is achievable, but we can address ourselves to reducing the incidence and severity of such things. </PARA>
<PARA> The Occupational Health and Safety Commission was established in 1985 and was formed to rectify previous difficulties caused by the fragmented approach to occupational health and safety and to provide a national focus for the development and application of uniform standards and strategies. In my speech to the amendment Bill in 1988, I said that the Australian Democrats supported the establishment of the Commission but we believed that its output and effect had been disappointing. I think one has to monitor constantly the effectiveness of commissions of this type. I am interested to note that Senator Durack has flagged the intention of the coalition-should it become government-to abolish this Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill addresses some of the criticisms of the McKay report, particularly the lack of coordination between State and Commonwealth legislation. So, in general terms, the Australian Democrats support the Bill. My colleague, Senator Coulter, who will pass brief comments, will flag certain reservations and concerns that we have, and which we will be seeking the Minister and the Government to address through regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairly predicably, Senator Durack ran the coalition's usual States rights arguments-that is understandable; it is its position in principle. The coalition essentially has a philosophical position to minimise the imposition of Commonwealth legislation over and above State legislation. But I think in running that argument-which, as I say, was predictable-he has rather confused the issue and the intention of uniformity. Indeed, the very role of the Commission, as it was intended when it was established in 1985, was to address the inherent difficulties associated with States on their own pursuing issues of occupational health and safety without some coordinated umbrella legislation at the Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also predictable that Senator Durack would focus on the unions' roles in this matter. To use his terms, he described them as pursuing with their usual busybodiness as many affairs of the nation as they can. I think, frankly, that that was a fairly empty criticism and observation concerning the very genuine and legitimate concern of unions in relation to occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Cooney quite rightly points out, there are few areas of concern that historically have drawn such intense attention as has the issue of occupational health and safety. To argue that unions are just simply being busybodies in pursuit of this interest I think fails to acknowledge the legitimate role of unions in industrial relations and issues that flow from it. To suggest they have no place is to fly in the face of the realities of life. I am afraid that to suggest that their pursuit of these issues is nothing more than busybodiness is very superficial indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack suggested that of course occupational health and safety is an important issue and it can be adequately addressed in enterprise agreements. But with the increasing focus on productivity-which is one of the thrusts and focuses of the coalition's industrial relations policy-I would suggest there is a grave temptation in the pursuit of productivity for profit to fall back to where we were in terms of giving adequate attention to occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> Our record in Australia has not been good. There have been a number of serious reports which have been very critical of our record in occupational health and safety. I think this has probably been partly because it is very tempting for employers-particularly in the pursuit of productivity-to downgrade the significance of this aspect of the workplace. It is costly; it is expensive; and it does require special attention and special commitment of the employer. Of all of the commitments of the employer, I think this would be the one that is most threatened by a thrust and an emphasis on productivity for profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats in general terms support this legislation. We congratulate the Government for finally addressing it adequately. However, we do have some rights, which Senator Coulter will now turn the Government's attention to. In the committee stage we hope to seek assurances from the Minister as to aspects of this legislation which we hope will be addressed through regulations. I think that Senator Cooney has correctly made the point that in this type of legislation, regulations are probably the best way to go in some respects. But there are assurances which we would require of the Government in relation to regulations flowing from this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some pleasure that I rise to support this legislation, because it is an area in which I was involved for some years in my former work. I had occasion to investigate a number of situations involving government employees in South Australia where quite serious health hazards were involved. The government departments concerned were uncaring of the health of their employees. In my experience I think it is fair to say that government departments have not been any better than private employers when it comes to the occupational health of their employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to mention a couple of situations in which I was involved personally with the investigations. Contrary to the assertions of Senator Durack, who indulged in a bit of his usual union bashing, I found that the unions behaved very responsibly in these particular cases and had very legitimate concerns over the agents to which their workers were exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In opening, I think that it is fair to comment on the occupational risks related to the exposure of workers to mutagens and carcinogens. This is the area in which I work. It is fair to observe that some 25 per cent of the population in any Western country, including Australia, will get cancer at some stage and about 20 per cent of the population will die of cancer. Epidemiological studies indicate that perhaps as much as 90 per cent of that cancer is related to environmental factors. These studies look at the incidence of cancer in one area relative to another area. Through these comparative epidemiological studies, it is possible to find an incidence of cancer which is a background incidence and then to ascribe all cancers beyond that background level as related to some environmental factor in that particular region. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly true that most of those cancer-causative factors are still unrecognised. Of those that have been recognised, many relate to naturally occurring factors in the environment or factors which are easily under the control of the individual. We all know that the most common environmental factor causing cancer is tobacco smoke. We know of a number of other factors in the environment which relate to cancer. But there is still a significant residue of factors which almost certainly relates to occupational exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention a couple of investigations in which I was involved in the late 1970s which indicate the extent to which workers quite recently have been exposed and the response of the government departments to those exposures. In one instance I was called upon by a health nurse in one of the largest government departments in South Australia to see whether I could aid in the investigation of what the workers perceived as a possible health risk. The workers were involved in covering very large metal pipes with pitch-soaked bandages to prevent the pipes from rusting. Through general reading I was aware that pitch contains a number of carcinogenic substances. The health nurse concerned had contacted members of the Health Commission and they said that they had great difficultly in properly estimating the risk to which workers were exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the tests that I was doing in my laboratory, I indicated that it was quite possible to get quite an accurate fix on the risks involved. I asked for a sample of the pitch before and after it was heated, from which I was able to calculate the amount of carcinogenic agent being released into the atmosphere to which these workers were exposed. Roughly, the workers were melting the pitch in 44-gallon drums in a relatively closed environment, bucketing this material out and then painting it onto these large pipes. It turned out that in the course of heating up a 44-gallon drum of this pitch, the equivalent of 4 million cigarettes worth of carcinogens were being released into the environment in which these workers were working. They were inhaling this material and, quite clearly, were being exposed to a very significant health risk. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the report which I made to the department, and which of course I made available to the workers, that practice was stopped. What happened then was very interesting. The Government department then decided to contract this work out to a private contractor. That is relevant when it comes to the obsession which the Opposition has for contracting government work out with the claim that that will somehow produce more efficient and less costly material being produced. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case, the work was contracted out, the work continued to be done and the workers in the private concern were not informed of the hazards to which they were exposed. Further studies were carried out by the Health Commission, a government instrumentality, without my laboratory being involved and without the workers being notified. This actually is contrary to the law in South Australia, where any investigation should be followed by notification both to the employer and to the union.</PARA>
<PARA> So in this situation we had the collusion of several government departments to get work done which had been demonstrated to be extremely hazardous to the health of workers so that the work could continue in a private capacity and the particular department could still continue to have its pipes covered in pitch. </PARA>
<PARA> The second example involves the laboratory in which I actually worked. As a member of the safety committee, I was asked to investigate a situation which had been identified as potentially hazardous. This involved the preparation of what were called specific pathogen-free animals. These animals were kept in a sealed laboratory. The workers went into the laboratory through a shower trap. They shed all their clothes, went in through a shower, donned sterile garb, worked in there all day and then came out through the same shower trap in the evening. The air that went into the laboratory was filtered and rendered bacteria-free. Everything went in through a steriliser. The food to feed these animals went in through an autoclave-type arrangement which used ethylene oxide as a sterilising agent. Ethylene oxide had been recognised for some years as a mutagen, a potential carcinogen. The question then arose: were the workers not exposed to the ethylene oxide degassing from the food before it was actually fed to the animals?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the four workers-one male and three young females-were all expecting to enter their productive years shortly and therefore were very concerned about exposure to mutagens. They had already discovered that if this food were fed to animals in less than a fortnight the animals died. So clearly there was something in the food which was highly toxic. Investigations revealed that indeed there was a material being formed in the food from exposure to the ethylene oxide. That material was about 50 times more mutagenic and carcinogenic than the ethylene oxide itself and in fact was being released particularly while the animals were actually eating the food, because the highest levels of this agent in the atmosphere were actually in the area where the workers spent most of their day cleaning the cages and providing fresh food to the animals. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this situation because on that occasion as a member of the safety committee I was asked to do this by the institute where I worked, but I was also asked by the person in charge of the laboratory whether I would provide information to the workers as it became available so that they could form some assessment as to the hazards to which they were exposed. Believing that workers should have that knowledge, I made that information available to them and that occasioned a great deal of consternation on the part of the management of this government run and financed laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of management on that occasion was that it was inappropriate to provide information to the workers as to the agents to which they were exposed and the degree of risk to which they were exposed. In neither case were strikes involved and in neither case were there spurious reasons. In both cases, significant health hazards were raised by the workers themselves. These were investigated and indeed there were serious hazards involved which could be addressed, but in both cases government employers were involved and took action to suppress the information from the workers and to cover up the degree of risk involved. In that context, I think it is highly desirable that this uniform national legislation be put in place because I cannot believe that those two instances-and a number of others in which I was involved in South Australia-are in any way unique. I think those sorts of things probably have gone on and have involved other government departments in other States and have unnecessarily exposed workers to considerable risks. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the significant part of this legislation to which I would like to turn now and which I would like, in the committee stage, to draw to the attention of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is the clauses which deal with the extent to which this Act binds the Crown. I note that clause 11(2) says:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in this Act renders:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Commonwealth; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a Commonwealth authority other than a Government business enterprise; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a person who is employed by:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Commonwealth; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) a Commonwealth authority other than a Government business enterprise;</PARA>
<PARA>liable to be prosecuted for an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>To my mind, this raises the question of exactly what power this legislation has to force the Commonwealth to observe its own legislation. After all, we are talking about the occupational health and safety of Commonwealth employees, and I would have thought that it was necessary in this legislation to make the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authorities liable under their own legislation. I would like some clarification of that from the Minister when we get to the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also to draw attention to clauses 6, 7 and 8, which deal with both national security and internal security. Clause 8 deals with acts which should not prejudice certain police operations. I notice that all those clauses essentially absolve the particular departments covering either national security or certain police operations from responsibility in relation to occupational health and safety if the recognition of an occupational health and safety problem would prejudice national security or police operations. I can fully understand that in the case of soldiers and sailors at the present time in the Middle East. They are exposed to the risk of being shot at, which clearly is a health hazard. There is no question that the hazard in that case could not be covered by this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, let us suppose for argument's sake that it was deemed desirable that unexposed asbestos still be used in ships for insulation purposes, even in peacetime but in preparation for possible conflict, and that it was thought that the non-use of asbestos under those circumstances might prejudice national security because in some way the ship might be more likely to catch fire, be sunk or something. That is a hazard to which the sailors may be exposed. We have seen a celebrated case recently with the death of the Governor of New South Wales from an asbestos-related illness which I believe it was claimed he had acquired during time in the navy. Following from that, there have been a number of other claims that sailors have been exposed to asbestos. Could the responsibility for exposing people to those sorts of risks be avoided in any way under these particular clauses of this legislation? I notice that in both clauses 6 and 7, which relate to the defence forces, there is a subclause (4) that refers to subclause (2), and in each case the subclause (2) says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Director-General of Security may, after consulting with the Minister, by notice in writing, declare that specified provisions of this Act do not apply, or apply subject to such modifications and adaptions as are set out in the declaration, in relation to . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Various things are then specified; subclause (4) says:</PARA>
<PARA>A notice in writing under subsection (2) is a disallowable instrument for the purpose of section 46a of the Acts Interpretation Act . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is a provision in this legislation for parliamentary scrutiny of these exclusions from the provisions of this legislation, but it seems to me that it requires very close scrutiny and a fair bit of knowledge of the potential risks associated with some potential exclusions. As I said, Parliament will need to scrutinise this matter closely to ensure that the risks-other than the risks of direct conflict, such as being shot at and so on-are brought under this legislation, as I believe they should be, and that workers are adequately protected. However, when we turn to clause 8, which deals with the acts which may prejudice certain police operations, we find that it contains no protective provision at all. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in this Act requires or permits a person to take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, that would be, or could reasonably be expected to be, prejudicial to an existing or future covert operation or dangerous operation of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to define `covert operation' and `dangerous operation' and concludes with the words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . exposure of a member to the danger of serious physical harm or death, other than a danger arising from a cause within the control of the Australian Federal Police, is reasonably necessary for the effective performance of the function or the provision of the service;</PARA>
<PARA>That clause provides for no parliamentary protection, no oversight at all. I can foresee situations in which for the purposes of carrying out covert or dangerous operations it may be deemed `necessary' to expose workers to risks which do not relate directly to the danger to which they were exposed as a consequence of the covert or dangerous operation, such as the risk of being shot at. When we get to the committee stage I would like some clarification from the Minister as to the protective devices available under clause 8 in relation to police operations. </PARA>
<PARA> With those questions to be taken up in the committee stage, I return to the earlier theme. Along with my colleague Senator McLean I support this legislation. We believe that it is highly desirable to have uniform national legislation in this area. We believe that it is necessary to make it explicit, and we will look very closely at regulations which clearly will need to be passed under this legislation and, more particularly, at the codes of practice which will come in under this legislation in relation to exposure to particular agents, particular circumstances and particular hazards. Clearly, they are the things that will set the standards determining the level to which Commonwealth employees will be exposed to hazard in coming years. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not support the Opposition's second reading amendment, as my colleague Senator McLean has already indicated. I give notice that, if in future there is a Liberal-National Party government, we will oppose the abolition of the uniform national legislation which we are debating today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been four speakers, apart from me, in this debate, and I congratulate Senator Durack as the Opposition spokesman and Senator McLean as the Australian Democrats spokesman for their contributions. However, without in any sense diminishing the thanks that I have just offered, I congratulate in particular Senator Cooney for my own Party and Senator Coulter, who has just finished speaking. Senator Cooney is a distinguished lawyer in workers compensation and brought to this debate a wealth of insight that would otherwise not have been available. Like Rumpole for the defence, Senator Cooney has always advocated the role of the underdog and thus it is not surprising that he sees the value of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill through the lens of workers who might be in a situation requiring the protection of their occupational health and safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter, who is a professional scientist in his non-senatorial role, has had particular exposure to matters of occupational health and safety and has brought a scientist's mind of analysis and concern to the debate. I thank and congratulate both speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate now has before it the Bill itself and a second reading amendment moved by Senator Durack, which the Government opposes, and which I understand from the remarks of both Senator McLean and Senator Coulter the Australian Democrats also oppose. As for the Bill itself, the Government is the proposer, the Democrats are supporting it and the Opposition is not opposing it. I think that is a direct summary of each party's position on this legislation. Given all of that, this Bill has the numbers for unanimous passage. However, in recognition of the arguments that have been raised as considerations, question marks or misgivings with which people have qualified their support for this legislation, I will briefly answer each of those. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not support the amendment moved by Senator Durack for the reason that it makes a nonsense, in the pure sense of that word, of the Bill. This is a Bill to cover Commonwealth government employees occupational health and safety provisions. To support a Bill that does that and then to carry a motion that says it is not needed because the States have legislation in this area is to attack the very premise of the Bill, and on that logical ground the amendment ought to fail. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant second point why the amendment should fail is that this is a Bill for Commonwealth employees. It is in this sense aimed at cutting down the red tape involved in having six State statutes applying to Commonwealth employees and having provisions applying to Commonwealth employees that differ between the States so that a worker employed by the Commonwealth in one locale may be subject to different standards from a worker in another State. It seems to me that in those circumstances, while it is true that the Commonwealth can make its own regulations, if you like, or impose its own standards in terms of a statutory requirement, this amendment should fail. It is better that there be one comprehensive set of Commonwealth laws applying to employees of the Commonwealth. It is for those reasons in brief that I oppose the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation arises out of an excessively long period of consultation between the Government and unions representing Commonwealth employees and others with an interest in occupational health and safety-indeed, our own Worksafe Australia. The consultation started in 1983. We are giving effect, therefore, to something that has been talked over considerably and refined in discussion to suit the needs of the Commonwealth and people employed by the Commonwealth. What I said in my second reading speech perhaps bears brief repetition now. On average, the incidence of occupational death, injury or disease in Australia is unacceptably high. Each week an average of 3,000 Australian workers have a compensable injury requiring them to be off work for one week or more. The work force has a lost time element-time lost because of occupational health and safety absenteeism-that is about 10 times greater than the time lost through industrial disputation. According to the national account figures which the Australian Bureau of Statistics has estimated, in 1989-90 the total bill in occupational health and safety lost time alone was $4.8 billion in terms of the national accounts or 1.3 per cent of Australia's non-farm gross domestic product. That is just the direct costs. If the indirect costs were added the figure would be much higher. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with that background that the Commonwealth approaches this legislation. The Opposition has stated in the debate that it regards some of the provisions as unnecessary in part because the States should apply their own legislation. I think I have basically answered that. The uniformity cuts the red tape, and it is possible to foresee that if the Commonwealth did not have this legislation the unions with coverage of Commonwealth employees could apply to the Industrial Relations Commission for an award covering occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> It is far better that the conditions to apply for Commonwealth employees be legislated for arising from agreement than be arbitrated on arising from contention between the parties as to what should apply. Whether or not there was State legislation, the option open to the employees of the Commonwealth would still be through their unions to apply for an award. Of course we will consult on the standards that we propose by regulation later to describe. They will reflect the needs of modern day Australian workers. I think that is appropriate. It is not appropriate that the State legislation apply in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The other argument is that the Commonwealth could simply do it. So we could, but to do it with legislative force is to signal to the work force that we are dinkum about the encoding of standards in law that protect their basic rights. That is an obligation of good government. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other objections raised was that the safety committees and the elected representatives have excessive power. From the debate it seems that this is objected to because they may in origin spring from unions. That is an ideological debate between the Opposition and the Government about the role of unions. I welcome the support of the Democrats on this. Unions are a legitimate part of the social fabric in Australia and they have a key role in this. That was said amply and eloquently by Senator Cooney. </PARA>
<PARA> Some reference was made to occupational health and safety being used artificially and wrongly as a means of industrial disputation with employers to visit pain upon an employer while the union got off scot-free. There is some evidence that this occurs in the building industry. The Government does not support that; we deplore it. I do not think that anything in this legislation can reasonably give rise to that. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill imposes upon the Commonwealth a duty of care to its employees. By doing this we accept our responsibilities. As well, it imposes rights for employees to select representatives to represent them on occupational health and safety, with the range of responsibilities that those representatives will have being a reasonable range of responsibilities to carry out the job properly once they have been appointed. It will prescribe standards on specific hazards. The operational elements of this Bill will be overseen by Comcare. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a necessary piece of legislation. It is not simply cluttering the legislative statute books. It provides real rights. It answers a real need. It sets for Australia an important standard in seeing that the rights of individual workers to enjoy a safe, hazard and disease free environment are upheld properly in an appropriate form. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have no amendments. However, I would like to raise a couple of matters with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and seek his response and assurance. The first relates to clause 11 which deals with the extent to which the legislation binds the Crown. I spoke to this during the second reading debate when the Minister was in the chamber. It seems to me slightly peculiar that a Bill which covers Commonwealth employees-that is, employees of the Commonwealth itself-should seek to absolve the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority other than a government business enterprise, or a person who is employed by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority other than a government business enterprise from being liable to be prosecuted for an offence. I raise with the Minister the question of exactly what recourse an employee has in relation to a negligent act taken by the Commonwealth or by an employee of the Commonwealth under this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question that I would like to ask the Minister relates to clause 8 which, as I indicated during the second reading debate, is the clause dealing with actions which may prejudice certain police operations. I draw the Minister's attention, particularly, to clause 8(2) which deals with covert operations and dangerous operations. The subclause, in part, states:</PARA>
<PARA>``dangerous operation'' means the performance of a function or service under section 8 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 in circumstances where exposure of a member to the danger of serious physical harm or death,-</PARA>
<PARA>and these are the relevant words-</PARA>
<PARA>other than a danger arising from a cause within the control of the Australian Federal Police, is reasonably necessary for the effective performance of the function or the provision of the service;</PARA>
<PARA>There are several questions arising out of that. The first question is: who makes the determination that the danger, other than a danger arising from a cause within the control of the Federal Police, is reasonably necessary? Who makes that determination that this exposure, which is now excluded from the provisions of this legislation, is reasonably necessary? What safeguards are in the Bill for the people exposed? Unlike the preceding two clauses which deal with the defence forces, those exclusions are disallowable instruments and, therefore, come before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Who makes the decision and what safety mechanisms are in place to enable those things which others may regard as not necessary to continue to be covered by this legislation? For instance, if it were deemed necessary in the carrying out of a dangerous operation to expose workers to a hazardous substance, that would be within the control of the Australian Federal Police but it might be regarded by somebody as reasonably necessary for the effective performance of their function-for instance, exposure to nerve gas, even tear gas or something like that, or exposure to any one of a number of toxic agents. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, there is nothing in this Bill which indicates who will make the decision in respect of the safety provisions or the supervisory provisions which may be in place to ensure that, indeed, these measures are reasonably necessary for the effective performance of the function or the provision of the service. I would like to ask the Minister those two questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to pick up as completely as I can the nuances and all the variations that apply in each of those questions. Let me take the first question concerning the extent to which the Act binds the Crown, which is set out in clause 11.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I would say is that this Bill prescribes, of course, as we know, occupational, health and safety mechanisms to protect Commonwealth employees. If, under one of those regulations, a Commonwealth employee suffers injury or disease, that Commonwealth employee, given the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, is entitled to compensation and, should rehabilitation be appropriate, to rehabilitation. If there is then a loss of function and physical or mental impairment to some extent, as assessed medically, that employee is entitled to compensation in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not, therefore, a province of law in which there are actions for recovery of damages as such. This is an area in which there is no fault. Whoever's fault it was-whether it be the employee who negligently conducted himself or herself, or the employer who negligently supervised-the injury is covered by paid time off, compensation for loss of function and entitlement to proper rehabilitation. If the question is whether there are suable offences for damages, this is not an appropriate area of law where that applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The next reasonable question Senator Coulter asked was how somebody who is dissatisfied with the conduct of the Crown and who is an employee of the Crown might be protected if the right to sue or to take action at law, as might happen in a vehicle negligence case, applies. Let me refer to the reason why this Bill provides for the selection of safety representatives with powers of inspection and safety committees with powers of investigation and report. I note that one of the powers of safety representatives is, where necessary, to engage outside consultants to advise them on the conduct of their responsibilities. In that way there is an independent person in the workplace, other than the employer, elected by the people in that workplace to speak up for them. The reason why this involves Comcare, an authority of the Government that is not directable by the Minister, which has the carriage of the matter, is that there is an external agency outside the Public Service Commission which is also able to express a view or to take action. </PARA>
<PARA> The sorts of things that would apply were there to be a department or officers of a department who condoned negligence or acted negligently or matters that required disciplinary action involve a range of measures, including the naming of such people in Parliament. Therefore, there is a range of ways in which the interests of individuals can be protected, although there is no sense of fine upon the Commonwealth; the Commonwealth has some privilege. I think that answers as fully as I can, and as fully as I understand the questions put to me, Senator Coulter's points in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The area in which this legislation would not apply is where an officer of the AFP, who for the purposes of this legislation would be the worker, is on covert operations. In that sense he or she would be in a similar situation as would Defence Force personnel who are engaged in military conflict. I am not an expert on covert operations in the Federal Police, and I hope that I shall never become an expert, as it is not my line of country in any sense. But from what I know of what happens, having served on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, covert operations entail infiltrating organised crime syndicates and things of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is hypothetical but one could imagine the circumstances where some officer of the Federal Police successfully infiltrated a covert operation as directed by his or her superior. The officer concerned may be involved in risk taking activities that exposed them to danger. In those circumstances this legislation would not apply. Who would make the necessary decision? The superior officer directing the worker, in this case the police officer, in the covert work would make the decision that this was operational work of that nature. If there were a conflict, the Australian Federal Police enjoy the protection of a strong, articulate union and I am sure that union would speak up. In any case, there is provision for an elected safety representative to be involved as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether I have thrown some light on Senator Coulter's questions; I hope that I have answered them. Certainly in the circumstances of the Federal Police, when somebody is on active duty of a covert nature, obviously he is exposed to various dangers which in the normal course of Commonwealth employment would not be the case. When he is in the category of active service on covert duty, he is not covered by these provisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept entirely the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) so far as it goes in relation to clause 11. In explaining why the Crown is not bound in these matters he said that there is an agency arrangement which can speak up on behalf of the worker and that other provisions are involved. However, the reason that I have linked that with this matter of the operations of the Commonwealth Police is it seems to me that, by the very nature of covert operations, that mechanism may not work. One would not through one's union, which was the mechanism that the Minister was saying would operate under clause 8, take up the matter of exposure of an agent in the course of covert operations. I can fully understand that, if one is carrying out covert operations and infiltrating an organisation, one may indeed be identified and may be shot. Clearly that is a risk which can be foreseen, and a person going into that type of operation would have to accept that risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, suppose one's superior officer said, `I want you to carry agent X along with you so that, in the event of your being discovered, you could use agent X against the person who discovered your identity', and if in that way agent X carried a risk to the person in question in being exposed to that agent, the words that apply would be `reasonably necessary for the effective performance of the function'. The Minister's reply is that the superior officer would determine what was reasonably necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that in the course of carrying out covert operations, it may not be possible for the worker involved to say, `Agent X is not necessary for this particular covert operation. Agent Y would serve equally well and agent Y would not expose me to this unnecessary risk'. I want to tease this out a little to ensure that there is adequate provision for protection of such workers in these circumstances. There is no other mechanism-I understand the reasons why-written into this legislation by which the exposure to agent X can be brought before the Parliament or some other committee. The exposure can be judged as either necessary or unnecessary. Therefore, I am still a little concerned that the Bill by this clause may fail adequately to protect some workers because there is no explicit mechanism and implied inability to use the mechanism outlined by the Minister because of the covert nature in which the person is involved. </PARA>

Let me make a dash at it and he can tell me whether I have it right. We are not talking here about some undercover Australian Federal Police officer who, as he is having concrete poured into a barrel around his feet, complains about ambient smoking by the people doing the job, so that therefore he might be in risk of lung cancer. In such circumstances he is at imminent risk of being tossed into Sydney Harbour. We are not talking about that type of complaint. That is to make a foolishness of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I should just complete the explanation I was giving to Senator Coulter on his questions concerning how the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill 1990 would operate for Federal Police officers on covert duty where the substances-or, in terms of the question, the chemical agents-they may come into contact with or be required to use in certain circumstances are dangerous or injurious to their health. In all honesty, I had misunderstood the detail of the question. Now that I have had a chance to discuss it during the dinner recess with Senator Coulter my understanding is that it is as follows: if an officer of the Australian Federal Police were to require some other junior officer on covert duty to carry a chemical agent for self-protection or for whatever other purpose and that agent was not the most appropriate-other substances were available which were less injurious to the person carrying them but still able to render the particular service for which they were carried-how would the officer get on if he wanted to switch to the more environmentally benign agent? It seems to me that the answer to that question is--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coulter" NAMEID="TF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It seems to me that in some senses-I think this is fair comment-the question almost defines out the theoretical range because Senator Coulter wants some antagonistic chemical substance to be used in a defensive capacity. I think the worst description of offensive weapons is as defensive weapons, because they are weapons and that is that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In essence, the answer to the question is that, if there are other substances, that is a matter for the agencies, such as Worksafe Australia, the union or the elected safety representatives to indicate. That can be done in such a way as the particular circumstance of the covert operation may not necessarily have to be disclosed. There is a whole class of such operations where this situation could apply so that the particular issue might not be identified to endanger the people involved in the operation but nonetheless their occupational health and safety requirements can be met as best may be. I repeat: the role is for the advising authority-in this case it would be Worksafe Australia-the union or the elected representative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has come to the view, with some considerable reluctance, that it cannot support the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990, the purpose of which is to enable Australia to ratify protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. The Bill has a history in this Parliament in that we will remember that some little time ago the Labor Government introduced it and sought bipartisan support. At the time we indicated, after considerable consideration and consultation, that we were not in a position to support it and the then Attorney-General withdrew the Bill, recognising the importance of bipartisan support for international treaties and other similar obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since then, the Opposition has given much more consideration to the legislation and has raised the possibility of the Government entering reservations in the hope that a position could be agreed between the major parties. The Government has not been prepared to accept our suggestion of reservations and, therefore, regrettably we are unable to support the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Protocol I was concluded in 1977 after many years of negotiation and is, of course, about protection of victims of international armed conflicts. I guess that our good faith in this matter is demonstrated by the fact that my colleague Senator Durack, at the time of early negotiations, was the Australian Attorney-General involved and my colleague in the other place Mr Andrew Peacock was at that time the Foreign Minister for Australia and was also involved in those negotiations. We support the spirit of looking at further ways in which we can protect the victims of international armed conflict; it is the detail of the ultimate documentation that came out of the long negotiation process that causes us concern. </PARA>
<PARA> This is protocol I. There is another protocol, protocol II, relating to non-international armed conflicts; but that, as I understand it, does not require domestic legislation prior to ratification. The protocols contain particular protections for categories of persons, such as the wounded, the sick, the shipwrecked, and civilian medical and religious personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> As was made clear by my colleague the shadow Attorney-General during debate on the Bill in the other place, the coalition supports and encourages the expansion of international humanitarian law. We regard the aims of the protocols as laudable. As I said, for reasons of detail and, in particular, our concern that this protocol, if ratified, would place too many impediments in the way of our armed forces and, in fact, may endanger them, we are not prepared to give our support to the legislation. We acknowledge the many arguments that can be put in favour of ratification and, in particular, those which were very cogently put by the International Committee of the Red Cross visiting this country. We have had long and considered discussions with its members. But, as I said, the arguments in favour are, in our view, outweighed by the arguments against ratification. </PARA>
<PARA> Those which can be described as the senior or otherwise major countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation have also had this concern and have not been prepared to ratify-neither has our principal alliance partner, the United States of America. It has similar reasons for concerns that we have, which I will detail in a moment. It is interesting that within our own immediate South Pacific region, the only countries that have signed have been New Zealand, Vanuatu and Western Samoa. Real problems will be created, in our opinion, by Australian ratification when it comes to the joint operation of our military forces with those of our allies. </PARA>
<PARA> We are immediately conscious of the arrangements for the allied forces in the Gulf at the moment. If two contributing forces, say Australia and the United States of America, are participating, basically under a different set of rules, one can imagine the practical difficulties that will occur which could put one party to that alliance under obligations that it would regard as intolerable. The interoperability of our forces with those of our allies has to be considered and that is why, if Australia is to ratify this protocol, we believe that it is important that we do so with our principal allies. Certainly, they are unlikely to do so without the sort of reservations that we put to the Government and that I will mention in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) acknowledged the difficulties in the protocol when he wrote to President Reagan, when he was in office a little time ago, and referred to the number of ambiguities and operational complexities that come out of the protocol. I think that is something that is accepted by all. It is a question as to whether we are prepared to overlook those difficulties in a desire to meet the spirit of the protocol. We think that is something that is too dangerous when we are talking about the lives and capability of our armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think anyone would argue that the protocol is not extremely legalistic in parts and also vague in other parts. When we look at the very serious consequences of breaching the protocol, then we recognise the major difficulties that are being put before our armed forces. In many ways we are also concerned as to whether the nature of our defence equipment, particularly the strike assets such as the F111s and the submarines and their capacity, is incompatible with aspects of the protocol. If we were inhibited in using such assets or in having the potential to use such assets with a capability of attacking the bases and infrastructure of aggressors, then we would regard that restriction as intolerable and we are not prepared to place that upon our armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from those general concerns, there are a number of specific provisions of the protocol that cause us difficulty. Article 1.4 is one such example which provides that the protocol shall apply to certain types of wars of liberation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Under this article, the provisions of the Protocol apply to ``armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination''. </PARA>
<PARA>We are concerned with this term `alien occupation' because it has no settled meaning in international law. We are also concerned that, by including so-called wars of liberation within the obligations of this protocol, we are in some ways lifting the status of such conflicts and blurring the traditional distinction between international and civil wars. That is something that causes us concern in the longer term because in some ways it can be interpreted as giving a legitimacy to such conflicts. I know there is always great difficulty in distinguishing between a terrorist and a freedom fighter. It is one area in which we are happy to err on the side of conservatism. We look to ways of resolving particularly internal disputes but also, of course, all disputes if at all possible by peaceful means. To raise the status of such wars and in some way to accept their legitimacy by incorporating them within such a document, we think, sets an undesirable precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> Articles 20, 51.6, 52.1, 54.4, 55.2 and 56.4 contain a blanket prohibition against the right of reprisal. That causes us concern. In our opinion the prohibition conflicts fundamentally with the right of self-defence which is recognised in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. There is, of course, a settled right of collective self-defence in an effort to answer aggression. It is a right that is widely accepted as well as contained within the Charter. Often the mere threat of reprisal can be an effective way of bringing an end to breaches of international law and of influencing a potential aggressor not to carry out such aggression. We very much regret any inclusion within domestic law that would inhibit that capacity to threaten retaliation and arguably these provisions would do so. Therefore, they arguably could be more likely to contribute to aggression and violence rather than to dissuade such unsatisfactory conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 35.2 forbids the use of weaponry which might cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. Obviously, superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering is not something a government of a country such as ours with the basic values that we have, or our armed forces, would wish to inflict. But when one thinks about it, it places an incredibly difficult burden upon our armed forces to decide whether a particular action they are going to take in the interests of protecting our interests might have that effect. This element of subjectivity, inherent in the article, causes us great concern. Just in passing, it is a matter of interest that it is not present in the French translation of the protocol. I presume that it is a matter of language rather than any intended position. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 56.1 prohibits attacks against dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations. Again, generally, those sorts of resources are not such which we would readily attack in a war situation. It is commendable that the alliance forces in the Gulf have not attacked dams. I think one dam, if breached, has the capacity to do enormous damage to Baghdad. It is understandable, in some circumstances, that these objects will have a military facilitation and it might be in the best interests in the longer term of bringing the war to an earlier end and thus alleviating unnecessary suffering to attack such targets. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns us is that that flexibility is lost and we have faith that our armed forces, again consistent with the values that they are seeking to uphold, would be able to adequately weigh the military utility of attacking such targets against the cost and loss to the public. But the draftsmen of this protocol obviously do not feel that they can rely on that. I guess that, in many ways, our concern with the document as a whole is that it is those upon whom we would like to see this document imposed who are probably going to least take note of it when it comes to a moment of decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I do acknowledge that article 56.1 is qualified in some ways by the introduction of the words `normal function'-in other words, the protection is to be removed where the normal function of the installation is to provide regular, significant and direct support for military operations. But I do not think that resolves the dilemma that is faced by the decision makers at the head of our armed forces at these moments of great difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 44.3 deals with the way in which certain combatants should distinguish themselves from the civilian population. We are concerned with that because they are given protections under this protocol and treated as combatants, not if they wear uniforms or are otherwise clearly defined but, as I read it, simply by adequately displaying their arms. One could understand that, in a guerilla situation, that would impose great difficulties upon our forces and we are not prepared to be parties to implementation of laws that have that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Articles 48, 49.1 and 49.2 prescribe the distinction between civilian and military objectives with a view to extending the protection afforded to the civilian population in times of armed conflict. Whilst we laud the spirit of those provisions again we draw to attention the fact that it will, in practical circumstances, often be very difficult to draw the distinctions that are so easy to write on paper and to incorporate in a document of this kind. Again, we are not prepared to place that unreasonable burden upon the decision makers at the head of our armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Under article 48, nations are obliged at all times to distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objects, and to direct military operations only against military objects. As I said, it is fine in the reading of it but there will be times when it places an impossible dilemma upon those who have to make that judgment in the heat of battle. </PARA>
<PARA> Articles 52 and 57 prohibit attacks which may cause `incidental loss of civilian life'. Again, no-one wishes to see the loss of civilians in times of armed conflict, least of all those who share our basic human values and have respect for human life and the dignity of each and every human life. But there will always be civilian casualties in any conflict and there will always be incidental loss of human lives, but we hope that they will not be deliberate. We would abhor the deliberate targeting of civilians, but that is not the question in point. It is very difficult to impose the obligation upon our military forces that they will be prohibited from causing incidental loss of human life. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 51.4 prohibits indiscriminate attacks which, under article 52, include those which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. Similar language is included in article 57.2. If one contemplates trying to make that decision in terms of the precision of that language, it can easily be seen how impossible the task is that we are setting those who have to interpret these provisions in a moment of great trauma. We believe that the language goes beyond the intended simple codification of the principle of proportionality by which nations are obliged to conduct military operations so as not to cause unwarranted damage to civilian objects. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 82, which obliges nations to ensure that legal advisers are available at all times to advise military commanders of their obligations under the protocol, is in our opinion simply unreal. It just seems to have been written out of all context with reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has proposed that a declaration of understanding be lodged on ratification with reference to aspects of articles 5, 44, 51, 52 and 57. But a declaration of understanding is an interpretive measure and does not alter Australia's obligations under the protocol. Unlike the lodging of a reservation, which is the form that we have suggested, it would have no influence on the judgment of Australia's actions in international law. Such a declaration of understanding would not address the protocol's fundamental problems of lack of realism and ambiguity, and we therefore reject it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing that the Government has taken the view that any reservations to the protocol would be incompatible with its objects and would therefore not be permissible under article 19(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. It does seem to us to be simply a convenient argument because of the nations that have ratified the protocol. Many have, in fact, lodged reservations in order to address their concerns about the ambiguities within the protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has therefore come to the view, as I said at the outset, that it cannot support this legislation. We regret that our efforts to persuade the Government to express reservations have not been fruitful and we regret that we are not able to give the bipartisan support that we would otherwise have wished to give when an Australian government enters into such an obligation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990 attempts-and I think with the support of the Australian Democrats it is going to be a successful attempt-to bring into operation protocol I, which is additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. It seems to me that, no matter what else is said, the objectives of this Convention are the most laudable that we have discussed in this chamber for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand what Senator Hill has said, he is in sympathy with the general thrust of what is attempted here to give protection to civilians who are slaughtered-and that is not too strong a word-in wars. It is an attempt by the United Nations-to which we recently said that we give such adherence as to be more than admirable; in whose name we are now at war in the Gulf; of which we have been a member since the Second World War; and which is to be the foundation of the new world order-to try to spare, as much as is practicable, victims of any particular war. </PARA>
<PARA>3 The protocol has been ratified by 88 states, including members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)-countries such as Denmark, Norway, Italy, Iceland, Canada, Greece and Spain. The Opposition finds that, because of some niceties of language, it is not able to pass legislation relating to that sort of convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument put by Senator Hill in his usual forceful manner would mean really that we would not pass the Ten Commandments if they came before this chamber because they had not been precisely identified. One of the Ten Commandments says: Thou shalt not kill. On Senator Hill's argument, we would say, `We really cannot pass that lot. We certainly have the most sympathetic approach to what you are trying to do, Moses. But, really, you have not put into proper language what you mean by not killing, because we may have to defend ourselves'. And properly so. If somebody rushed into the chamber with a gun, and I had a gun, I am sure I would shoot back. </PARA>
<PARA> I see in the chamber a member of our military forces, a proud instrument of this land. But we would have to say to Moses, `We cannot pass this because you have not made enough exceptions; you have not been precise about it. We cannot pass this, unfortunately'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we would have to read the fine print and there is a bit of that. But even if we look at the fine print, it could be said that it is not taken far enough. Then we could say to Moses, `Look, you have got a thing here which says that you cannot steal'. I see that Senator MacGibbon is in the chamber. He would say that imposing taxes would be some form of larceny, so we would have to make some exception for that. We would go on and say, `Do not covet your neighbour's goods'. One could say that we have all sorts of problems about that because at times we have to confiscate goods for the country. Unfortunately, on the argument put by Senator Hill, the Ten Commandments would not get through this chamber. The same could be said about the Magna Carta, which again is a statement of general principles, and the Bill of Rights. None of them would get through-not even the Constitution of this country would get through. Of course, the Constitution is most unclear because it is a general statement of principles to be read in the light of what everybody knows is the general thrust and details which need to be obtained can be fleshed out later. It would be absolutely impossible to produce a document that satisfies what Senator Hill was trying to put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everybody knows what we are talking about. It is a general statement of the sorts of things that we as a nation, and the United Nations representing the general world community, want to see if the disaster of war occurs. Senator Hill says, `Well, look, what about the poor military commander? What about the poor government?'. Well, what about the poor people who are largely powerless to do anything about war, whether they are in a democracy such as ours or a dictatorship such as that of Saddam Hussein's?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that constitutionally, under the Westminster system, we go to war not on the vote on the Parliament but on the say so of the Prime Minister of the day. That is how we went to war in 1939 and that is how we went to war on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> To my mind, simply to say, `Look, we as a leadership can impose upon the people a war, do nothing to somehow protect them'-whether they are in the armed service or whether they are the civilians who accept, because they have to, the raining down of bombs-`and give them absolutely no protection except some sort of vague analogous to common law approach that after the war we might do something about people who have perpetrated these evils' is just out of all proportion to the sorts of terrors we expect them to face. </PARA>
<PARA> This protocol, with all its faults-and Senator Hill has gone through them-does that. What we are saying if we do not pass this protocol is this: it is more important to protect the anxiety which military chiefs might suffer in deciding whether or not to make an attack than it is to protect the citizens of the country against whom war is being waged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take this up. This is the argument that is put: Senator Alston is saying that an honourable senator who gets up in this chamber and supports the Geneva Conventions is somehow giving solace to Baghdad. This is what is being put by the Opposition, through the words of Senator Alston: it is somehow traitorous if an honourable senator supports this Convention; that somehow comfort is being given to people like Saddam Hussein. The fact of the matter is that this Convention will be passed through this House with the agreement and consent of Australia's own military forces.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters then says, `Well look, there is some difficulty because it is said that there ought to be legal advisers'. Of course there should be legal advisers. It does not mean to say that legal advisers have to be next to the gun saying, `Look, you can shoot this round'. I will read article 82 which deals with legal advisers in armed forces, because it is another indication of how the Opposition has twisted the logic. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The High Contracting Parties at all times, and the Parties to the conflict in time of armed conflict, shall ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary-</PARA>
<PARA>which Senator Hill seems to have left out-</PARA>
<PARA>to advise military commanders at the appropriate level on the application of the Conventions and this Protocol and on the appropriate instruction to be given to the armed forces on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> `Appropriate' is the word used; `when necessary' is the phrase used. It means that it should not be simply up to the military command or even to the Prime Minister-if that is the person involved-the president or the dictator, simply to decide how these conventions should work. The article says that it should be given a proper legal interpretation so that the meaning of this Convention should be clear. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Convention is properly read, there is no suggestion that there should be interference by legal people in the actual theatre of conflict. The question of the general thrust and the way the armed forces are being used in terms of their compliance or otherwise with this Convention should be answered with legal advice. Article 57 was attacked because it states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the conduct of military operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what President Bush has been saying-I accept his views on this matter-in reference to the bombing of the shelter, which has brought headlines such as `Backlash on civilian deaths' in the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 February 1991. Of course there was a backlash, and there should have been. The President of the United States came out and said, `Of course we did not mean to kill the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects', yet the Opposition is opposing the proposition to which President Bush agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> In opposing article 57, the Opposition is clearly opposing the very concepts that President Bush has proclaimed. Article 57 (2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to attacks, the following precautions shall be taken:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) do everything feasible</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the word `feasible'-</PARA>
<PARA> to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Why would anyone oppose that proposition? Why is that so objectionable? Why in all humanity would anyone oppose that proposition? President Bush said, `We do everything feasible'. He complied with this, but not the Opposition. Article 57(2) (a) (ii) reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that subparagraph is opposed because article 57 is opposed. What is wrong with that? Why would anyone oppose that? Let us look at some of the other things that Senator Hill opposed. He said, `Article 20 talks about reprisals and we want to take reprisals'. Reprisals mean that people should not, as a matter of revenge, go and slaughter civilians. Why oppose that? It means that, if we did go to war and we won, we would not go around crucifying and abusing the citizens. That sort of thing has always been part of the process of war. We only have to look at the speech of King Henry V before Harfleur in Shakespeare. He comes out with that concept. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>What rein can hold licentious wickedness</PARA>
<PARA>When down the hill he holds his fierce career?</PARA>
<PARA>We may as bootless spend our vain command</PARA>
<PARA>Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He talks about the rape, the plunder and the spoil. In his day he objected to this. Article 20 talks about not taking reprisals on citizens in that sense, yet the Opposition opposes it. Members of the Opposition disagree with the President of the United States and would not pass the Ten Commandments. Shakespeare was well ahead of him in his day. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 56(1) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is an admonition to balance. It says that we are not to go knocking these things down, blowing them up and releasing them upon the civilian population so as to cause not loss but severe loss. We are not to do that if the consequences of doing so are disproportionate to the consequences that follow. Article 56 (2) says:</PARA>
<PARA> The special protection against attack provided by paragraph 1 shall cease:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know why Senator Hill did not read subparagraph 2. It is easy enough to knock over straw men, but if the Opposition is going to object to this, for heaven's sake-and I say this advisedly; this is a matter of life and death and destruction to policy-look at the text and what it means and then oppose it, but do not oppose article 56(1) without looking at article 56(2) as well. Article 49(1) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> `Attacks' means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Protocol with respect to attacks apply to all attacks in whatever territory conducted, including the national territory belonging to a Party to the conflict but under the control of an adverse Party. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 49 then talks about humanitarian protection contained in the Fourth Convention. Why oppose that when all it wants to do, in so far as it is possible, is bring some rules into the waging of war. If we have this instrument of doing business around the world, and given the history of the human race, it seems to me that we have always had wars and it looks as if we are going to have them in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The world community says, `As a group of people, through the proper organisation, the United Nations, let us see if we can do something about this horrific instrument of policy, this terrible instrument of war, to modify the horrible, ghastly destruction that comes about'. What is wrong with that proposition? All of us in this chamber, without exception, agreed that after the Second World War there should be some sort of retribution on those who brought war upon the world. We must have come to that conclusion because we thought that the nazi regime acted in such an horrific way that the nations of the world ought to get together and do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In a certain sense we applied retrospective laws. We simply said that even though there was no world order at that time and no specific war set out, nevertheless a concept of common law was such as to provide a basis for doing something about it. It seems to me that we are in a much stronger position if the world community, through the United Nations, sets out the ground rules. That is what this article does. People are going to say, `We do not think article X is quite what we want, article Y is as precise as it might be, or article Z suits our particular side'. The world community has come together and, with all its faults, said, `We think the document in schedule 1 to the Bill sets out fair and reasonable rules to be guided by'. Because of some literal errors, because we feel this has been awkwardly expressed or because it might not cover everything we want, why should we reject the great good this could do to gain some sort of leverage and improve what we want in future legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, we ought to pass this legislation and, if we think something should be changed, we will change it, as we do through this Parliament. The United Nations meets regularly. Oftentimes we pass Acts that we intend to amend. Indeed, an example of this chamber passing legislation which it is not happy with is the legislation on occupational health and safety. The Opposition did not oppose that legislation, but its members said, `In the give and take of this place, and the give and take of legislation, we will put that through and fix it up later'. That is an important Bill, but for heaven's sake how much more important is this, which sets out rules and regulations which may save thousands-indeed millions-of lives in the way in which wars are conducted? It may save property and great and glorious buildings which symbolise the greatness of the human race-buildings such as the Taj Mahal, St Peters in Rome, St Pauls in London or the Louvre in Paris. </PARA>

I do not for one minute doubt that members of the Opposition hate and detest war and the death and destruction it causes as much as anybody else in this chamber, but because of overcaution and an overly legalistic approach-perhaps even too great a fear that everything has not been covered-they have lost a great opportunity to take advancement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will come as no surprise, I am sure, to those who know the history of the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill to discover that the Australian Democrats give it our unequivocal support. The Bill is identical to the one the Government introduced in the House of Representatives in March 1989 but, because of the Opposition's criticism at the time, the Government decided to withdraw it. It should be said that the present AttorneyGeneral (Mr Duffy) really has tried to get total parliamentary support for this legislation but, given continuing opposition from the coalition, it is understandable that he has decided to introduce it regardless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fairness to Senator Hill and to the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, I believe they have tried to reach a position of compromise with the Government on the matter, but unfortunately they felt it was not possible in the end. This is a pity, since we understand that the convention which eventually led to the finalisation of these protocols was in existence during the period Mr Peacock himself was the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Fraser Government.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the delays in bringing on this Bill, however, former Australian Democrats Senator Michael Macklin introduced his own private senator's Bill in August 1989 in an effort to get the Government to ratify the protocols updating these laws of war. I know that former Senator Macklin was very committed to the ratification of these protocols and it was a source of disappointment to him that debate on this Bill did not come on while he was still in the Senate. He is, I am sure, very pleased that we are finally debating the Bill tonight. This Bill seeks to give legislative effect to progress made in international forums in humanitarian law. The Democrats recognise that essentially these two protocols aim to restrict, as far as humanly possible, the horrors caused by warfare. This need has been accentuated in recent weeks by what we have seen taking place in the Middle East. International humanitarian law should be concerned with the lives and welfare of individual human beings in peace as well as in war. </PARA>
<PARA> The written law which deals with the fate of human beings during armed conflict has been developed over the past 120 years and the Bill before us is really only the latest addition to those laws. The most important of these laws was the Geneva conference of 1949, which resulted in four conventions being adopted. These have since been ratified by 145 nations. In 1977 the two protocols before us today were adopted and signed, following the diplomatic conferences of 1974 to 1977, by some 97 nations in the case of protocol I, and by some 87 nations in the case of protocol II. To date we understand that 88 countries have ratified these protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> These protocols were developed after much hard work by many organisations, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross, which we believe deserves some recognition for the results of its efforts in helping to bring about the legislation before us. Our understanding is that the Australian delegation was very active throughout the conference from 1974 to 1977, and that Australian representatives, both military and civilian, made important contributions to the compromise process and to the overall and eventual success of the conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Geneva protocols, as opposed to the Geneva Convention, deal in greater detail with matters such as civil defence, protection of medical, religious and media personnel, protection of children in particular and other civilians, and use of distinctive emblems such as the Red Cross. Most notably the Bill before us seeks to extend the provisions of the four Geneva Conventions and to introduce new principles. For instance, these protocols incorporate the new and important concept that the principles of law governing armed conflicts between nations should apply also to conflicts between the armed forces of a state and organised dissident forces within state boundaries. Understandably, this expansion of the Geneva protocol to include conflicts within a state's boundaries has met resistance from some nations and indeed has not been ratified for precisely this reason. Protocol I applies international humanitarian law to armed conflicts:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racial regimes in the exercise of their right to self determination. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the nature of some of the regimes that both the superpowers have supported in the past, it is not difficult to work out why both the United States (US) and the Soviet Union have opposed ratification. The irony is that, during the conferences in 1977, the United States played a very active role in ensuring that the protocols were adopted by consensus. At the time of the conference both the United States and Australia signed the protocols. Since then the United States seems to have withdrawn its support and we can only assume, given the pronouncements of the US military, that the Pentagon feels that the first protocol would restrict defence forces too severely in conducting their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the opposition of some nations, however, these conventions may be seen as almost a complete consolidation of written international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts. Like the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the protocols before us today strike a balance between military necessity and humanitarian considerations. Rules of humanitarian law are always the result of a most complex process of compromise between demands for an effective national defence on the one hand and the common will to uphold certain human values even in war on the other. The international conferences held in the 1970s to develop these protocols were no different. It was a long and arduous process of negotiation and, yes, there was some compromise to reach an outcome that was acceptable to as many nations as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this, we find it difficult to accept that the first protocol is a controversial document. The provisions for the protection of medical services in times of warfare, for instance, or relating to the search for missing persons, or relief action for civilians, are all important additions to the Geneva Conventions. The underlying principles of this law are that the human dignity of all individuals must be respected at all times and that everything possible should be done to reduce the suffering of those who take direct part in the conflict or have been put out of action because of wounds or captivity.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as we have seen in recent weeks in the Gulf war, there will always be some regimes, such as the Iraqi one, which have little or no respect for such principles. The treatment of captured military personnel by the Iraqi regime blatantly contravenes the provisions of the Geneva Convention. The behaviour and attitude of Iraq in relation to those prisoners of war and Iraq's indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations in both Israel and Saudi Arabia cannot be condemned too strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> We respect the reasons the Opposition has given for opposing this Bill, but we remain unconvinced by its arguments. The Opposition's claim that ratification would hamper the armed forces conflicts with the view held by most in Australia's military that Australia could be involved in a war without any difficulty in meeting our obligations under these protocols. Again, we must emphasise that these provisions have all been drafted with the active participation of military experts from all major countries, including Australia and the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be hard to accept that Australian military personnel were involved in the development of a protocol with which they always disagreed. In fact, virtually the opposite is the case, with Australian military personnel not only actively involved in developing these protocols but also giving their positive endorsement to Australia being one of the first signatories. We also have the encouraging situation where more than half the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries, including Denmark, Italy, Canada, Spain, Norway and Greece, have already ratified the protocols. Given this background, it is hard to understand why opposition from some sections of this Parliament still continues. Indeed, I would have thought that the use of terms such as `feasible' and `as far as possible' in the attached articles and protocols give military commanders the necessary latitude to take into account virtually any specific circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> Under these circumstances, we find it difficult to accept that a Bill which aims to give additional protection for the victims of warfare should be met with opposition. Since the Menzies Government ratified the original 1949 Geneva Convention, Australia has had a very good record in showing concern for the fate of the civilian population in times of war. Indeed, one of the reasons for our good reputation overseas is that we have been such ardent supporters of improved international humanitarian law. The Democrats believe that we should now ratify both the protocols and thereby show the electorate and our neighbours that this country is willing to accept binding obligations of a strictly humanitarian nature. Australia's ratification of these protocols will cement our commitment to limiting the scope of war to military objectives only, while at the same time strengthening the provisions which give protection to civilians and to prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have to date not signed these protocols, global support overall has been strong. If Australia failed to approve this Bill, it would be setting a deplorable precedent. It would in fact be the first time in history that a Red Cross humanitarian treaty was rejected by this Parliament. We look forward to the passage of this Bill and to the signing of these protocols by Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill. It is quite disturbing to hear the arguments that have been put forward by Senator Cooney and Senator Bourne. It is very worrying to think that a vote will be taken on this amendment and that the Australian Democrats in particular do not understand what they are voting on and the implications of that vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition does not oppose this Bill lightly. We would, however, be failing in our responsibility to Australia's armed forces and security if we agreed to certain articles of a protocol that could weaken our alliances and make the job of our service personnel that much harder. These protocols are additional to the 1949 Geneva Convention, already enshrined in Australian law, and seek to elaborate on the protection given to civilian populations in times of conflict. In this proper objective they have created ambiguities that can only cause problems for our armed forces. It distresses me that both the Government and the Democrats are not aware of those ambiguities and do not want to try to resolve that before rushing into agreeing to this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 102 articles and 63 pages of the protocols, and most of these are fully supported by the coalition. These include medical care of the wounded and bans on experiments on internees. All honourable senators would support the proposition that the medical needs of an occupied civilian population should be provided and that the deliberate bombing of civilian targets is wrong. While we may regard certain articles as impractical and by extension dangerous, the coalition firmly upholds accepted humanitarian restraints on the conduct of war on the hopefully rare occasions when this becomes necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> By the nature of our society and national character, Australia already stands committed to the decent treatment of defenceless and innocent people, and ratifying the protocols will make no difference. Essential humanitarian provisions are already part of Australian law through the Fourth Geneva Convention and this will remain regardless of the fate of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> What disturbs me, however, are the ramifications of article 48, headed, `Basic Rules'. This directs parties to a conflict to distinguish at all times between civilian and military objectives so that they `accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives'. That is all very desirable, but it is all very impractical. We know that that in real life is an impossibility. The word `only' will cause severe practical difficulties for military commanders when a ruthless and cynical enemy of the stamp of Saddam Hussein deliberately surrounds a military installation with civilian facilities. Therein lies one grave concern that we cannot simply brush under the carpet. I am sorry that Senator Bourne has already left the chamber. Maybe she would understand that what has happened in recent weeks is a problem that will only be exacerbated by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 51 of protocol I has a similar uncertainty in prohibiting attacks on military objectives which may cause incidental civilian casualties `excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated'. This can only hamper the efforts of our armed services in conjunction with our allies to destroy the military capacity of an enemy as swiftly as possible and avoid the horrors of a prolonged conflict. It is an open invitation to ensure, in light of the events of recent weeks, that a baby milk plant is placed beside every chemical weapons establishment. That is what we are looking at. It will make the situation absolutely and utterly absurd and unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad if unpalatable truth that if a liberal democracy is forced to wage war for its own survival or, as in the present circumstances, for collective security, the most humane war policy is to destroy the capacity of the enemy to wage war, and as quickly as possible. For this reason, I have to query the impact of article 56, which decrees that dams, for example, should not be attacked, `even when these objects are military objectives', should civilian losses eventuate. It is an impossibility. It is illogical. Where would this have placed the World War II dambusters? Service personnel must not be exposed to allegations of war crimes when simply carrying out the necessary destruction of enemy infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) states correctly and properly that some Iraqi civilian casualties are inevitable in the task of freeing Kuwait, it behoves this Government to think carefully before committing Australia to a convention that could tie the hands of Australian servicemen in such a situation. It is one of the grim facts of history that in 1944 President Roosevelt, in the planning of the Normandy landings, insisted on the bombing of Nazi communications in occupied France even at the cost of thousands of civilian casualties. The bombing was an immense strategic success, but 10,000 French civilians died and as many as 40,000 deaths were feared. This was a terrible decision that had to be made but who are we to argue that it was mistaken or immoral when it saved the lives of allied servicemen, shortened the war and liberated France from a very real tyranny? We are more fortunate in 1991 that western military technology can greatly limit civilian casualties. But there will inevitably be losses when Hitler's adoring disciple, Saddam Hussein, holds the lives of his own people in absolute and utter contempt. In the face of this tragic reality it is not only impractical but also immoral to tie the hands of the military. </PARA>
<PARA> When we have a situation where article 82 insists that commanders be provided with legal advice while planning operations, it becomes apparent to many of us that we are denigrating our service professionals. That is what has happened in this exercise. It is the legal servicemen and not the commanders and the people out in the field who have given the Government advice. With all due respect to the legal officers in this situation, the commanders and the people out in the field are the people we should be listening to. Surely there are already enough career openings for lawyers in modern society. It might be thought more appropriate for a commander in a genuine moral dilemma to seek advice from a chaplain, not a legal officer. Legal advice will become necessary only when commanders are hampered by more than the usual constraints of commonsense and common humanity. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Government may be told by the legal section of the Department of Defence that it can live with the protocols, the Australian Defence Force Journal of January and February 1991 draws a discreet distinction between the provision of advice and full support for a proposition. Can the Government deny that Australia's front-line service people do not have serious concerns as to the impact of the protocols? I would be very interested to hear the Minister's response to that very question. I do not believe that it can say that it has no concerns. It is in the nature of servicemen and women in a democracy that they do not speak out against government policy, but it should not be abused. It becomes all the more necessary for a responsible government not to proceed until such fears are resolved and those people who are literally prepared to die for Australia do not in any way believe that their danger faced in combat will be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Those honourable senators who support this Bill fall into two categories. In the first category are most government members, who would not wish to see our armed services rendered less effective, but consider that the protocols pose no practical difficulties. Therein lies the distinction between us and them because we do see the practical difficulties. We are not for one moment suggesting that the Government is intentionally trying to put more pressure on the service personnel, but there are practical working difficulties. The Government had better be right because we, in the coalition, would prefer not to take any risk whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second category are those on the far Left, including of course the Australian Democrats, who are hellbent on hampering our armed services in the task of defending freedom for Australians, Kuwaitis or anyone else. They are more than happy to see those who resist international outlaws fight with one hand tied behind their backs. The sooner the Democrats get out of this type of argument, the better off the country will be. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we ratify the protocols, we should look closely at which nations have taken this step as distinct from merely signing them. That is the issue I take on with Senator Cooney. He said that all eight nations had signed them. Very few nations within our region have ratified the protocols; neither have the leading western military nations with whom we must realistically expect to cooperate. Clearly, the United States of America and Britain have not ratified the protocols-Senator Cooney said that President Bush had ratified them-because they foresee the same practical difficulties outlined earlier. A government that, to its credit, has aligned Australia beside these nations in the cause of justice ought to be more alive to the possibility of such cooperation being impaired. What might happen if Australian naval units under overall United States command are ordered to fire on enemy shore installations where there may be some risk of civilian casualties? I stress that the problem will arise not because we adhere to a higher standard of moral conduct but because of the stupid ambiguities of those articles that I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Of those nations that have actually ratified the protocols, some in Europe and the West Indies are in areas safe from external military threat and thus removed from the dreadful practicalities of war. Others are nations whose records show that they have no intention whatsoever of adhering to the protocols or indeed the original and basic decencies of the Geneva Convention. The classic example is Iraq, which is blatantly violating the rights of prisoners of war and murdering Israeli and Kuwaiti civilians. Yet the Democrats and the Government support this. I simply urge a rethink. </PARA>
<PARA> The most practical means of protecting civilians, apart from the values of common decency that do not need to be gleaned from the protocols, is the advance of military technology that can minimise injury to civilians because targeting is so precise. Those who scream at the cost of military hardware should bear this lesson in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by stating that it will be a shame upon this Parliament if any Australian serviceman or woman is killed through the effect of legalistic constraints placed on commanders in combat. We cannot afford that luxury and I, as an Australian and as a member of this Parliament, do not want to see that as the net result. Ratifying these protocols will not give any practical additional protection to the civilian victims of war but it may just jeopardise the safety of our armed forces, the quality of our defence cooperation and the duty to bring hostilities to a swift and just conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it interesting to hear the sanctimonious claptrap, particularly of the Australian Democrats, about bringing our servicemen and women home. The Democrats, by their support of this Bill, quite clearly do not give a continental about what happens to our servicemen and women because they are placing them in a very unenviable position. I therefore urge the Government to think again. </PARA>

It will go on the international record as a further achievement of this Parliament and the Australian Government in the issue of human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was particularly interested to hear some of the remarks of Senator Knowles. I did not have the opportunity of hearing Senator Hill's remarks because I was at a meeting. But I am astonished that anybody in the Australian Parliament could oppose this Bill. I thought this would have gone through unanimously. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it particularly interesting that Senator Hill is opposing this Bill. I have not known Senator Hill long, but over the years I have known him he has been a hard and tireless worker on human rights issues around the world. I find it strange that he has to stand up in this Parliament to oppose this Bill. I suspect, looking at the list of the other speakers from the Opposition, that Senator Hill was rolled inside the coalition party room. When one sees that Senator Knowles, Senator MacGibbon and Senator Bishop are the ones leading the charge to oppose this Bill, one gets a fair idea that the extreme right of the Liberal Party of Australia has again triumphed over the moderate leadership of the Liberal Party. I do not think Senator Hill would want too many examples of this sort of decision of the coalition which is against the image that it is trying to create. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not hear Senator Hill's remarks to justify his position. I will read Hansard tomorrow with interest. After hearing Senator Knowles's remarks, I am even more astonished at the paucity of the Opposition's arguments in opposing this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I want to point out to the Opposition that, as I understand it, in March 1988 Senator Durack wrote to the Red Cross in Australia saying that the Opposition gave a strong commitment to the ideals of the Geneva Convention and supported this proposal. I cannot recollect whether Senator Durack was then a shadow Minister or not, but he certainly is and always has been a very senior member of the coalition. He was a former Attorney-General of Australia. He was willing to write in March 1988 to the Red Cross of Australia saying that the Opposition supported this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously even Senator Durack-who, I do not think by any description, could be called a wet within the Liberal Party-was willing to support it but he has been rolled by the conservatives of the Liberal Party. I find it very strange indeed. In the years to come, the coalition will be haunted by the decision to oppose this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened with interest to Senator Knowles's remarks. She tried to pick some articles out of the Bill to support her argument that this Convention puts at risk Australian service people in carrying out their duties in the defence of Australia or in military action. She particularly quoted article 56 and said that it was prohibited to attack certain installations because they could be considered civilian targets and so on. She quoted article 56-and this is what she was referring to, I would imagine-which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives-</PARA>
<PARA>She did not quote the next phrase-the qualifying phrase-which says:</PARA>
<PARA>if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses amongst the civilian population. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, it is qualified. Clearly, it is left as a matter of judgment for the military forces about whether such an attack can take place. Senator Knowles should not quote selectively from the article, because when she does, she forgets the qualification. </PARA>
<PARA> It has taken years of discussion and debate in the international forums of the world to draw up articles to cover the points that Senator Knowles was trying to make. She may have a point if some of the clauses that she failed to quote were removed. But I ask her please not to quote selectively from a particular clause and leave out a subordinate explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that Senator Knowles and the Liberal Party have failed to mention is the importance of this protocol in an area that has not been dealt with before-the question of a civil war. Protocol II for the first time attempts-and, I think, quite successfully-to say that where there is a civil war within a country, the people affected have some rights to protection. I quote from the second reading speech of the Minister as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Protocol II applies to situations of non-international armed conflicts between the armed forces of a Party and organised armed groups exercising some territorial control over territory of that Party. It does not apply to internal tensions, or disturbances such as riots or sporadic acts of violence.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the end of the Second World War most of the wars in this world would be called internal-civil wars. Unfortunately, there have been scores of them, probably close to 50 or 60, around the world over the last 40-odd years. In every case civilian populations have suffered disastrously in those wars because either side has chosen to attack the civilian population on the grounds that it believes the civilian population is a resource which the other side can use to help in that civil war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. What I want to say about the situation, as I tried to say before despite the interjections, is that if we ask the Eritreans we find that they do try to carry out their obligations, even though they are not formal signatories to the Geneva accords. They are a rebel force that controls a substantial amount of territory and a substantial amount of the population. As a result, they have close to 20,000 Ethiopian prisoners of war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But when one asks the Ethiopians how many prisoners of war from Eritrea they have, the answer is none. Why? Because the Eritreans, when they are captured, are executed. That is because, under international law, Mengistu is not obliged to give any recognition to the legitimacy of the fact that in this civil war the Eritreans are entitled to some protection. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say that in this example-and I have seen this first hand-protocol No. 2 would be a very useful development. I do not expect someone like Mengistu to take much notice of it, but at least it is a start to try to improve international order in this world. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which some people may say is not relevant in this context but which is mentioned in the schedule is the situation in South Africa. Apartheid is specifically mentioned in the protocols as an inhumane system. When I was recently in South Africa I spoke to a number of African National Congress people who had spent long periods on Robbin Island. I asked them how they were treated. They said that when they were first arrested, sentenced and sent to prison in the 1960s because of their opposition to apartheid they were treated as criminals. For example, they were not given shoes or socks, they were given no proper bedding and were forced to carry out a number of activities which were harsh and in- humane; they often suffered beatings. But they said that during the 1970s and 1980s under international pressure the South African Government, without actually conceding the point, started to treat them as prisoners of war. They said that when that started occurring their treatment improved considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> By the 1980s, although they were still imprisoned on Robbin Island or elsewhere in South Africa, their treatment improved because unofficially the South African Government conceded that they were prisoners of war and not criminals. Therefore, where internal disturbances occur and lead to civil war and where people because of oppression do not consent to be governed, if we can lay down as part of the international order that the ability to protect such people will be enhanced, I think that will be all for the better. </PARA>
<PARA> I am astonished that the Opposition would seek to oppose this Bill covering this Convention. I think that it will enhance Australia's reputation no end in the world. It will add a further instrument to our foreign policy in favour of human rights. Naturally, I expect some members of the Opposition, who have not overly covered themselves with glory on human rights issues, to oppose this legislation. They will use the furphy that this means we shall restrict the way in which our armed forces can defend this country in a state of war. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read the protocols and see nothing in them which provides that when we are legitimately defending our sovereignty, legitimately participating in such actions as the Gulf war sanctioned by United Nations resolution, we would be prohibited from carrying out the actions on which we are now embarked. If by some mischance a rogue member of the Australian defence forces carries out criminal acts of murder, we should be quite willing to ensure that that person is brought to book, charged and dealt with accordingly under the law. The definitions that have now been included enhance our reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> What distresses me somewhat is that Opposition members imply that our armed forces will be restricted. Indeed, they almost imply that those forces need these loose definitions to carry out war in a barbaric way against civilians and so on. I find that a slur on the professionalism of the Australian armed forces. In several wars at international level the Australian armed forces have covered themselves with glory in that they have not resorted generally or as a policy to the abuse of human rights, to attacking civilians deliberately. There have occasionally been instances where an individual has transgressed, but those instances have been dealt with. I think that it is a slur on the armed forces by the Opposition who believe that those forces cannot carry out their professional duties in accordance with the protocols outlined here, the amendment to protocol I and the adoption of protocol II. This Bill should be supported unanimously by the Parliament as it will bring greater recognition to this country for the honourable record that we already have of protecting human and civil rights in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of glaring errors of fact in Senator Schacht's pretence at a review of the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill that demand comment. I am afraid that it all stems from the fact that Senator Schacht's knowledge of military law, the rules of international armed combat and of the Geneva protocols is minuscule. It is not surprising because I imagine that a quarter of an hour ago he had not devoted any time to them. Certainly he has never had any involvement in this field before in his life. The closest that he has ever come to armed combat, I imagine, would be the grand final of an Australian rules match in Adelaide.

He rarely goes anywhere where he pays for himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the point about which Senator Schacht is sensitive and quite ignorant; that is, anyone who has worn a uniform of the Australian armed services has always been covered by military law. Australian service personnel have never had a licence to operate without respect to military law any time they have worn that uniform. It is a gross distortion of the facts for Senator Schacht to claim that that is not the case. The Opposition with very great reluctance opposes this Bill to amend the Geneva protocols. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not alone in that. The Prime Minister of this country, Robert James Lee Hawke, opposed the protocols and said as much in a letter to President Reagan when the protocols first came out. The Prime Minister has since been got at by the lefties in his Party, and it is not surprising when one looks at the speaking list for this debate. We see on it Senator Cooney, Senator Schacht and Senator Faulkner, all the far Left, all in here assuaging the fact that they have sold their principles out over the Gulf involvement. They have all been given a place on the speakers list so that somehow or other, as Senator Schacht describes himself, they can be a great moral force. They can get up in this place and talk about the iniquities of the Opposition bringing a bit of commonsense into this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We oppose this Bill quite simply because it hamstrings our own troops. If implemented, it will lead to unnecessary loss of Australian lives. I make no apology for the preservation of Australian lives, whether they are in civilian circles or whether they wear the uniform of this country. There could be bigger losses than the loss of a few lives. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the intention behind the Geneva protocols. We would support the protocols if they were subject to reservations. Most of the countries that have been paraded by the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and by the Australian Democrats as supporting this legislation have agreed to these protocols only under the imposition of various reservations to the protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> In my reading for this debate I came across a quotation by Clauswitz. I thought that it would be very appropriate for the Democrats but, having listened to Senator Schacht, I think that it applies to him to some degree also-perhaps not to the same degree because it starts by talking about kindhearted people not black-hearted ones. Clauzwitz said:</PARA>
<PARA>Kindhearted people might, of course, think that there was some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed, and might imagine this is the true goal of the art of war. Pleasant as it sounds, it is a fallacy that must be exposed: war is such a dangerous business that the mistakes which come from kindness are the very worst. </PARA>
<PARA>The best interpretation that can be put on the Government in supporting this is that it is making the mistake of kindness. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's record in the conduct of war and in armed conflict is second to that of no other country. We have nothing to apologise for at all for the actions of our men and women who have worn the uniform of the Australian defence forces. The way in which we have conducted war, the way in which we have used our weapons systems, and the way in which we have treated our prisoners of war do not need explanation, qualification or defence in any way whatsoever. Australia has respected not only the Geneva Conventions as they exist but the whole body of international law which, as the ALP and the Australian Democrats do not understand, goes back not 50 years or 100 years, but hundreds, if not thousands, of years. There is a whole body of international law in relation to armed conflict. Australia has always respected and supported the principles of it. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular protocol that we have before us was drawn up by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Few people realise that the only people who can be members of that Committee are Swiss nationals, Swiss civilians. The ICRC held a series of conferences over the years to which international representatives were invited. Presumably this is the body that Senator Bourne talks about as being full of Australian military personnel, actively involved in the formulation of the record. Nothing can be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming majority of members at the Committee meetings over the years that led to this recommendation being formulated by the ICRC was made up of those from Third World countries, out of Africa and other parts of the world-people who actively pushed their own concerns. It might have been quite legitimate for them to push their own concerns, but the Western democratic nations were not the principal formulators of this policy. They were Third World countries and they were openly pushing what they saw as necessary in their own narrow interests. The interesting thing is that the Swiss Army or the Swiss defence forces, even though the Swiss have not fought for 200 years, rejected the protocol without major changes and reservations. Those reservations and rejections have been echoed around the other Western democratic nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States rejects it out of hand, will not have a bar of it; Britain will not have a bar of it; France will not have a bar of it; none of the Warsaw Pact countries will have a bar of it; none of our neighbours, not one of the Association of South East Asian Nations, will sign the protocol. The only region in the area that signed it was poor old New Zealand under Lange, or his successor. That is some recommendation! As I said, most of the Western powers, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries, that the Left wants to trot out as paragons of virtue and that signed the protocol did so with reservations; and they were the minor, inconsequential members of NATO. </PARA>
<PARA> How did we get into this position? The Department of Defence set up a review committee some years ago. It was composed of operational officers, that is, those who actually have to do the fighting, and a number of legal officers. The recommendation of the first Australian Department of Defence committee was so heavily qualified, so full of reservations, that it rejected the signing of the protocol. That committee's view, in true Department of Defence and government styles under Labor, was rejected, ignored. Another committee was set up to look at the matter which was comprised only of legal officers-I am advised that they were as few as two in number-and they accepted that we should be a signatory to the Geneva Conventions protocol. This Bill is the consequence of that. It is on that advice that the Chief of the Defence Force Staff makes his advice to the Government which is paraded by the Left as being the acceptance of the Australian defence forces. I have to say that I do not know one officer in the Army, the Royal Australian Navy or the Royal Australian Air Force who is involved in operations, that is, in a fighting role, and who supports the signing of this protocol-not one. If we had a secret ballot, we would find the proof of that statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill that is before us, for an Act to amend the Geneva Conventions Act of 1957, runs to 73 pages. It is a very legalistic document. I propose to follow the precedent that has been set by the other distinguished speakers who have spoken on this side of the chamber against it. A very excellent and brilliant speech was made by Mr Peacock in another place, where the legal implications of the Bill, clause by clause, were dealt with. Senator Hill has done the same here tonight. I wish to follow the example set by Mr N.A. Brown, Mr Nugent, Mr Atkinson, Mr Bradford and Senator Knowles, who have all preceded me either here or in the other place, and cite a few examples so that those who have not had the opportunity to wade through the 73 pages of the Bill can see why the Opposition has reservations about signing the protocol without amending it in some way or other. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Bill is restrictive and dangerous to a degree in its application to the Australian Defence Force. We believe that our history proves that we can honour, have honoured and are prepared to honour into the future all the humanitarian aspects in relation to the rules of law in the conduct of armed conflict. It is interesting that Iraq, which has had such a terrible history in the past 12 months, not to say the past eight to nine years, is a signatory to all the conventions. That is how binding and effective these conventions have and what great moral force they have. This is why the Third World countries love it. They can get a veneer of respectability by being a signatory but, when they get into armed conflict, it does not matter a darn to them; they still go ahead and do the things that Iraq has done. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the outbreak of hostilities by the United Nations forces against Iraq to clear it from Kuwait, we have seen Iraq, in breach of the Geneva Conventions, use prisoners of war (POWs) in public on television screenings. There has not been a word of protest about it from that side. We have seen televised forced confessions from POWs. Worse still, we have seen human shields formed out of these POWs and we have had Iraq boasting that some airmen have died because they have been human shields around military targets. All of these things are flagrant breaches of the existing Geneva Conventions by a country which is a signatory to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen not only the premeditated attack by Iraq on civilians of countries with which they are nominally at war, such as Saudi Arabia in the missile attacks on Riyadh, but we have also seen the release of many a Scud missile attack indiscriminately targeted intentionally and in a premeditated way against civilians in Israel. It is hard to imagine a more flagrant breach of any convention of war than that which we have seen from Iraq; yet Iraq has the moral stature of being a signatory to these conventions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of our problems comes from the fact that our principal ally is the United States. Our major treaty agreement is with the United States, and the United States will not have a bar of this convention. It makes it very difficult for us to ally ourselves with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that Mr Peacock made the definitive speech on this in the House of Representatives and it is interesting that when we read the House of Representatives Hansard, we see that none of the points that Mr Peacock made was ever refuted by the Labor Party speakers after him. They glissaded and skated around the points, but they never countered the legal points that he raised. Mr Bilney, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, made the claim that the matter of inter- operability, which is a very real concern to us, is not relevant because the Australian Navy is engaged in joint operations with the United States Navy in the Midway carrier battle group at the present time in the Persian Gulf. This overlooks the fact that this legislation has not yet passed through the Parliament and in that sense is inoperative. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very real need for interoperability here. Since we are the lesser power, the operational command is always in the hands of the major power. That means we take orders from the Americans. In the case of the Gulf-because it is a nice, simple, very clear example-we have got ships there as part of a carrier task force. If this Bill had been passed and was now an Act of the Australian Parliament, it would be quite impossible for any captain of an Australian ship to accept a fire plan to bombard the shore installations of Iraq or Kuwait because, under the terms of this Convention as it is written, the Australian captain could not say beyond reasonable doubt that he could not be sure there were no civilians in the target area. Therefore, as the Convention is written, he has no option but to decline to be part of that operation. That is an enormous limitation on us in relation to our allies. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern is the legitimisation of terrorists and irregulars. Senator Schacht made a great thing about that in relation to the South Africans. The fact of life is that, through history, there has been an enormously strict division between civilians and members of the armed forces. That has been done not to protect the soldiers, but to protect the civilians. Governments do not want civilians involved in combatant situations. For that reason, the international law of armed combat makes it very clear that certain conditions have to be met by any armed force. There has to be a system of command, there has to be someone in command giving orders and a chain of command set up. There has to be a uniform, which is clearly visible at a distance, worn by the combatants. Arms, rifles and weapons have to be carried openly, not concealed. The conduct of operations always has to be done with respect to the international laws of combat. This is all done so that civilians are not involved accidentally in the fighting between the combatant troops. </PARA>
<PARA> This protocol before us today raises to prisoner of war status, the equivalent of a uniformed member of an armed service, any member of a terrorist organisation. It does not matter how unlawful, how irregular, how literally without form or structure the organisation is that that person represents. There are very big advantages in that to the irregulars. Let us imagine that an Irish Republican Army terrorist had blown up the British Prime Minister and the British Cabinet a couple of weeks ago and had been caught. If this protocol had been in place that person would be a prisoner of war. He would have been locked up immediately with three good meals a day, no duress, nothing done to him at all. He would just sit there and watch television until such time as hostilities were over and then he would go home. As an irregular, as a guerilla, as a terrorist, a person is subjected to the civil criminal laws of the country. He is brought before the courts, tried and, if found guilty, he is convicted. There is an enormous difference between the two. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill aids the unscrupulous people, the unscrupulous countries, and penalises the scrupulous ones because it provides, for the first time, a positive incentive for military forces to merge with and to hide with the civilian community. It also inverts the traditional law of combat because the pattern has been to put the onus on the defender, not the attacker. This again reinforces the hiding of a country's military assets in the civilian community. </PARA>
<PARA> If we think back to the Second World War, the very first thing the Australian Government did was to withdraw Australian civilians from danger areas in the north and in the islands because that was its obligation, and the correct action. It is for the defender to protect the civilian component of his population from attack in whatever ways are open to him. Yet this protocol inverts that traditional system. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a large section on the use of weapons and weapon systems. This is very ambiguously written, but the protocol expressly limits the right of the parties-that is of nations-in an armed conflict to choose their own method or means of warfare by prohibiting the employment of weapons, projectiles, material and methods of warfare of a nature as to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. The definition that is there, `causing superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering', is so wide that most of the weapons that we want to use in warfare could well be deemed to be illegal. There is no argument that we would want to see nuclear, chemical and biological weapons banned. We want to see weapons that produce gross suffering to people in combat banned. But enshrining it in this legislation makes any commander guilty. It is conceivable that things like land mines, flame throwers and all the other things that, horrible though they might be, have a legitimate place in limiting the casualties of the side using them, could well be banned. </PARA>
<PARA> We should never forget that we are not in a debating society here. We are talking about a protocol which provides very stringent penalties. Anyone who breaches the conditions of the protocol can be tried as a war criminal and sentenced to 14 years. There is an obligation on military commanders to prevent, suppress and report breaches of the protocol. That is very simple to write, but in the heat of battle it is largely unenforceable. There are three great commands in the Army, the platoon, battalion and division, and I would not want to be any one of those three commanders if this protocol were in place. Commanders simply cannot defend themselves against the charge that they failed to prevent, suppress or report breaches of the protocol. Commanders are operating under orders from above and they have subordinates below them. In the heat of a battle they simply cannot control the situation to that sort of degree, so that they can stand up in a court of law some months or years later and be completely covered against all eventualities. </PARA>
<PARA> This protocol binds individually and collectively all the members of the Australian Defence Force. It is not only the Chief of the Defence Force who is going to go to court, it can be any person from the four star general at the top, down to the newest recruit, a private at the bottom. It is too ambiguous, it is far too complicated for any combat situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to comment on the Government's action with this. When the Government first moved to introduce these protocols, it came to the Opposition and the Opposition said it was not prepared to go ahead with the Government in this form. The Government, quite correctly, withdrew the Bill from the Parliament at that time. Lionel Bowen had enough sense to know that unless it was bilaterally supported it was so important an issue that it could not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Then what happened? I presume the Left got at the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and had the Bill brought in and reintroduced. It has come through with the support of the Australian Democrats, the rent-a-mob crowd for getting difficult legislation through this Parliament. But that is not good enough. This is a major issue for Australia and this Opposition will not put either the lives of individual servicemen or the country at risk through defective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been one of the traditions of the Parliament that succeeding governments do not revise, let alone rescind, treaties of previous governments. But this matter is so important that I think there is a high probability in government that in a year, 18 months time or whenever it is, we are going to have to come back to this and have a look at it. We are also probably going to have to look at a few other treaties that the Labor Party has put through, where it has tried to outflank the Constitution by using the external affairs powers to get past something that it could not get through the Parliament. There is a real need, I think, to review treaties that are on the book. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the spirit behind this. We are totally opposed to any unnecessary brutality or loss of life in armed operations. However, we do not believe that this very muddled, ambiguous and extraordinarily complex piece of legislation is at all effective. Not only is it ineffective but we believe that it is also highly dangerous for the operations of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He obviously got rolled, as did Senator Hill, by people like Senator Bishop in the Liberal Party room. I was also surprised at the Opposition's stance, because protocol I is such straightforward stuff. It aims simply to provide protection for the victims of international armed conflicts and to include breaches of the new protections in the range of offences under the Geneva Conventions Act; surely a priority for anyone wishing to display civilised and humanitarian attitudes. I am surprised that there has even been a need to have a debate on this issue. But my surprise increased even more when I looked at the pathetic case that has been mounted against ratification of this protocol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the case? Boiled down it is this: the United States (US) will not ratify the protocols. The Opposition sees Australia as creatures of the US. Therefore, the Opposition must reverse its previous stance on this issue. Australia must not place impediments in the way of the US or any manner in which it chooses to wage war. The late Mr Peter Hastings, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald on 20 March 1989, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The US opposes ratification on familiar great-power grounds. It would oblige the US in various armed conflict situations to fight with `one hand tied behind its back'. Washington has also warned if Australia ratifies the document the `interoperability' of US and Australian forces (their capacity to conduct joint operations) would be at stake. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, when the US says jump the Opposition jumps. Even if we grant-which I certainly do not-that we must accept creature status in relation to the United States, or any other country for that matter, the Opposition is very sadly off beam in this argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of protocol I, which the Opposition claims will make warfare less efficient, which is an amazing concept in itself in the context of a humanitarian debate, are contained in articles 35 to 58. They do indeed impose obligations on those engaged in warfare. These obligations are that they must ensure that their objectives in warfare are military rather than civilian. Article 57, precaution in attack, is of especial note to use in the past few days. This article reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA>1. In the conduct of military operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects. </PARA>
<PARA>2. With respect to attacks, the following precautions shall be taken:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this protocol to attack them. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 2 of article 52 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. In so far as objectives are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralisation, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to take a look at last week's bombing of an air raid shelter in Baghdad-in light of these provisions of protocol I. Would this protocol have prevented the US legally taking the action it did in bombing such a target? I quote from the front page of today's Australian:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite publicly defending last Wednesday's attack as a strike on a legitimate military target, senior Pentagon officials privately acknowledged to the Sunday Times-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here that that is where this story was obtained from-</PARA>
<PARA>they were wrong not to check whether the building was being used by civilians before jets struck it with two bombs on Wednesday night. </PARA>
<PARA> `The satellite reconnaissance said this was a deep, multi-faceted bunker, like other command and control bunkers,' a Pentagon source said. </PARA>
<PARA> `But there was very little on-the-ground assessment and we had no idea civilians were there.'</PARA>
<PARA>A case could certainly be made that the intelligence undertaken by the United States before the bombing operation did not conform with the obligations outlined in articles 57 and 52 of protocol I. Perhaps they do not wish to ratify the protocol because of situations such as this. However, it is not, I believe, acting in its own best interests in failing to ratify these protocols. I do not believe that anyone would accuse the US of having deliberately bombed an air raid shelter. I do not believe it. The same article from the Australian went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> `Clearly it was a propaganda victory for Saddam Hussein because we did not realise the civilians were there,' the source said. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to this, in the House of Representatives the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) showed a degree of clairvoyance when he said in last week's debate in the House:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the opinion of the Government that observance of these principles is necessary not only for the humanitarian conduct of armed conflict, but also for the success of military operations, paradoxical though that may seem. Enormous destruction of lives and civilian infrastructure can harden resolve in war and can undermine peace or the possibility of peace once hostilities cease. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the United States', and hence the coalition's, cause has suffered from this incident, and the United States would certainly admit that. If it had ratified this protocol and had observed its strictures on intelligence operations before this bombing raid, not only may 300 Iraqi civilians, mainly women and children, still be alive but the United States would have avoided the dismay and the grief that this incident has caused amongst its own supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> At any rate, the requirements on military commanders to take all care with the lives and property of civilians and innocent parties are not new requirements. No reasonable humanitarian and, I stress, intelligent commander would object to the codifying of these rules in this way for the purpose of bringing breaches of these protections within the range of offences under the Geneva Conventions Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, who is the Australian Government's senior military adviser, has advised the Government that it should ratify the protocols, that it will not affect the way we conduct warfare and that ratification is in the national interest. Of course, General Gration is looking at Australia's perspective and Australia's interests in coming to that conclusion. I would urge the Opposition to do the same rather than trying to second guess any of our great and powerful friends. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a sovereign nation and, I hope, a maturing nation. We must make decisions such as this based on our own interests, our own perspective and, I might say, our own morality. However, if we are going to look at what our friends have done-which seems to be very important to people like Senator MacGibbon-what about Canada? Canada has more forces committed to the Gulf than Australia has, yet Canada has ratified the protocols and, further, has made the subsequent declaration under article 90. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point for those opposite to note is that this has not affected Canada's relationship with the United States at all. The United States has managed to accommodate its stance on this issue; it has also managed to accommodate those of its other Gulf allies who have ratified the protocols. So I ask: why is Australia different?</PARA>
<PARA> I just mentioned that Canada has made the declaration under article 90. I would like to stress that I consider it most important that Australia quickly complete all processes and consultation necessary also to do this without further delay. I find it totally bemusing that it has taken 13 years for these protocols to be ratified and I think it is fair enough that we see no further delays. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Australian Red Cross Society have urged all in this Parliament to support the adoption of the protocols that are before us. The Red Cross, time after time in warfare, has to mop up the mess and destruction of lives and property caused by war. It has prepared a document setting out its views. In part, this document says:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has shown its concern for the fate of the civilian population in times of war. Australia should now ratify both Protocols and thereby show to its own people, to its neighbours and to the world at large that this country is willing to accept binding obligations of a strictly humanitarian character . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I strongly endorse these views and urge the Opposition to take note of them; they are words of reason and humanity. I might point out, too, that they are words of reason and humanity that have been heeded by many others. </PARA>
<PARA> As of late last year, 97 countries have ratified protocol I and 87 countries have ratified protocol II. This number includes our near neighbour, New Zealand, as well as other countries such as Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Switzerland. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been pointed out ad nauseam in this debate by the Opposition that in the list of those countries that have ratified the protocols the names of Britain, France and the United States are not present; that they are conspicuous by their absence. The point that I am making is that that need not concern us. We should look at our own perspective. We should look at humanitarian and international interests and make our own decision. On this issue we should not let our agenda be set by other countries. I strongly support this most important legislation before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have listened to a couple of diatribes this evening from the members of the Left of the Australian Labor Party. The thing which springs to mind first and foremost is this: what is it that compelled the Labor Party to reintroduce this legislation at this crucial time during the Gulf War? What is it that persuaded the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who has held a constant line, to be rolled in his party room by the far Left and to bring on this particular piece of legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We listened to Senator Coates's question to Senator Evans at Question Time today. He asked: could we please beg for a cease-fire? We note that Senator Childs has been a strong supporter of the appeasers of Saddam Hussein. The sort of rhetoric that we got from Senator Schacht and Senator Faulkner is the only justification they have. Senator Schacht, who purports to come from the Centre Left, had to hide his own embarrassment at being rolled by the Left by attacking the Opposition for refuting this legislation. To put it into context, I think it is important to know that the Opposition considered this particular legislation during 1989 on two separate occasions and gave it very serious consideration. The Party accepted the recommendation that was made by the shadow Minister concerned. Very simply, it is that advantages of this legislation are outweighed by the disadvantages. Accordingly, we are opposing the Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1990 this evening. Paragraph 3 of the explanatory memorandum, which accompanies the legislation, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The most significant change to the law is to be found in Clause 5 of the Bill, which, in effect, incorporates the obligation to punish `grave breaches', as defined in Protocol 1, into our domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the requirement that other countries who have become parties to the protocol-such as Saddam Hussein, a signatory-have agreed to do. Yet we have seen Saddam Hussein fire indiscriminate Scud missiles into suburban areas of Jeru- salem aimed specifically at civilian casualties. The reason that the missiles have not been as successful as he would like is that the Iraqis are forced to fire those missiles from mobile platforms which they then have to re-hide so that they are not bombed. Accordingly, their aim is not quite as accurate as they might have liked. Also, because those missiles have to travel some considerable distance, they have had to sacrifice the power of the missile for fuel to get it there; but the aim is to kill civilian populations. Yet we have heard no protest about that aspect from our friends on the left tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is quite poignant that we are debating this piece of legislation at exactly the moment that the whole dilemma of how to apportion blame in a war is being given as a very good example. I refer to the question of the bombing of the bunker in Baghdad over which so much controversy has lain in the last several days. On 16 February in Launceston, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he had been briefed by Australian intelligence officers on Thursday on the bombing raid and understood that the US had no evidence to suggest the shelter was being used by civilians. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Obviously I and all Australians are horrified at the loss of any innocent civilians, but I think they understand the accuracy of what I have said. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke told an impromptu press conference:</PARA>
<PARA>Allies in their targeting have been extremely careful to ensure they target military and strategic installations. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same day, General Kelly said that, indeed, the bunker was a military target. Today from the Australian we had a partial quote from Senator Faulkner, who is very good at partial quotes and the inaccuracies of the Left of the Labor Party. He quoted unknown sources from the Pentagon as saying that there had been an error. What he did not quote was the United States officials in Saudi Arabia who denied the admissions made in Washington and said that in particular the intelligence identifying the bunker as only a military command post was out of date. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have one group of officials saying that there was an error, another group of officials who are closer to the action saying it was not, the Prime Minister of this country saying that it was a military installation, and Saddam Hussein perhaps using the whole episode as a justification for the use of chemical warfare, which is of course also outlawed by international law. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the classic case of United States bomber pilots; Australian servicemen under a joint command; and the death of civilians, which may or may not be considered in terms of the protocol to be a grave breach of the convention. If this is to be brought into our civil law, as indeed this legislation would do, then there would be an obligation to prosecute anyone who came within our jurisdiction as a war criminal and to make that person subject to up to 14 years in gaol. That is what this protocol is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> A man of straw was erected by Senator Schacht. He wanted honourable senators to believe that at present if an Australian serviceman committed murder, he would somehow get off scot-free. That is simply not the case. There is ample law already in place to deal with that situation. We are dealing with a whole new scope of the conventions which have been in existence for some time but have become extended because there is an attempt to codify the law. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we realise what those other controversial aspects of the protocol are. Firstly, it would apply to wars of liberation and guerilla warfare by reason of article 1 (4); secondly, the difficulty in making distinctions between combatants and the civil population, especially in the context of guerilla warfare under articles 43, 44 and 48; thirdly, restrictions that are imposed on military operations under articles 50 to 58, which seek to protect civilians and the civilian population from the effects of armed hostilities; and, fourthly, the blanket prohibition on the right of reprisal provided by article 20. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with something such as the difficulty in distinguishing between what is an acceptable target and what is not an acceptable target, things such as nuclear power stations would be specifically outlawed. Does that mean that those nuclear power installations which were bombed in Iraq would make the people who bombed them war criminals within the context of someone against whom we would want to bring the force of law and moral opprobrium? I suggest not. </PARA>
<PARA> Who will forget the gruesome sight of allied pilots shot down, maltreated and humiliated by the televising of falsified statements against their homelands? `The butchers are torturing our boys' read the tabloids. This treatment was in direct contravention of the provisions of the Third Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war. This is the collective view of President Bush, Prime Minister Major and our own Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We have all heard the reports from Kuwait of the maltreatment of Kuwaiti citizens-the raping of women, the torturing of their men and the pillaging of their goods. These actions surely would be a blatant disregard of the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention dealing with the protection of civilian persons in the time of war. We should always remember that Iraq is a signatory to the protocol, yet we see nothing but contempt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Weekend Australian of 16 February an article written by Greg Sheridan about my Senate speech on 12 February appears. In that speech I urged the normalisation of Australia-China relations. This article is presented in a sensationalist style and seriously misrepresents what I said. I have never met this journalist, but he telephoned me briefly last Thursday. He asked me some general questions about my travel arrangements, but he did not question me about the topics he addressed in his article.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article grossly misrepresents the whole thrust of my speech and it misrepresents my own assessment of the issues that currently bear upon where Australia-China relations should be heading. The first misrepresentation is the article's headline. I am not sure whether this was the responsibility of Mr Sheridan or the work of a subeditor. The headline reads, `Lib rejects Chinese massacre ``trauma''.' This assertion is wrong. On the contrary, I condemned the massacre and I carefully described in my speech how its trauma is still felt by the people of Beijing. In my speech I described how I had recently observed that this trauma is still unresolved. In my speech of 12 February I actually said that this massacre is unparalleled in Beijing's entire history. There has never been so traumatic a massacre. I do not reject the massacre and I do not reject its immense trauma. </PARA>
<PARA> How it is possible for anyone to hear or read my Senate speech of 12 February and then write a headline like that defies comprehension. In contrast to Mr Sheridan, I am heartened that two of the many people who did read and listen to my speech carefully and understand it were Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Senator Robert Hill, the shadow Minister for that portfolio. They have not made any assertions such as those made by Mr Sheridan. I respect their constructive responses, which were entirely opposite to the sensationalist Sheridan approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The second misrepresentation is found in the opening paragraph of the article, where Mr Sheridan makes the accusation that I have `opposed Opposition policy towards China'. This is not correct. Such a policy detail is not always declared specifically, but is a movable feast in response to developments. It is correct to say that in expressing my personal views, which are entirely in the same direction as all Opposition statements made since last August, I am addressing the next step in that direction, which is the timing for Australia's decision to normalise our relations with China and end the sanctions policy. My colleague Senator Hill is more cautious than me in taking this next step. Although we have both criticised the Government for remaining too aloof from China in recent months and we have both urged the Government to adopt more direct dialogue with China, Senator Hill believes the time has not yet come to remove all sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans's response on this point was indicated in his remarks in the Senate at the end of the same adjournment debate last Tuesday. He said that he was giving very close consideration to taking this next step; the question at issue was the question of timing. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>In considering all these matters, it is very difficult to apply absolute considerations. To deal in any absolute way with the situations we confront is always a matter of drawing an appropriate balance between competing demands, competing objectives. It is always a matter of judgment as to how these responses should be applied, taking into account the nature of our relationship, the nature of the great issues of principle that are involved and, among other things, the nature of the reaction of other like-minded countries, and I can assure Senator Teague that all these things are being very closely considered at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters that is always relevant in considering these kinds of issues is the question of timing. It is the case, as Senator Teague himself acknowledged in his speech, that that is a particularly sensitive matter at the moment with a number of remaining trials either taking place or just concluded in Beijing. That is something that the Government, again, will need to bring into account in its deliberations on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, I am misrepresented in Mr Sheridan's article by the second headline, `Excellent propaganda'. This is mischievous and sensationalist, and is presumably intended to catch the reader's eye. However, it actually directs ridicule at my drawing attention to the deaths of some Chinese soldiers killed by civilian violence. It is my view that these soldiers' deaths greatly added to the urgency and ruthlessness of the army columns advancing towards Tiananmen. The misrepresentation is that this headline, `Excellent propaganda', is placed in the article at a point quite distant from the related text in such a way that it appears to denigrate my personal assessments as merely the acceptance of a foreign government's propaganda. This is not true, nor is it fair to leave open such a prejudiced interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> My own remarks about the detailed events of 3 and 4 June in Beijing appear to have raised Mr Sheridan's ire. Ironically, my remarks are not derived from statements from the Chinese Government, whether `propaganda' or otherwise. In fact, the few published statements made by the Chinese Government about the Beijing massacre are very limited in their detail and that is why in my speech I criticised the Chinese Government's failure to give all the facts and an adequate explanation. Some Chinese officials have put the number of soldiers' deaths as low as about 36 during the first week of June. However, I believe the figure may have been as high as 100. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is one point I should clarify and it concerns my phrase `in the few days preceding 4 June', which was quoted in the article. The point I wanted to emphasise was the new and increasing violence organised by students and non-students in the crowds occupying the roadblocks and Tiananmen Square at this time. This violence increased in the few days preceding 4 June. However, it is true that the deaths on both sides of the conflict mainly occurred on one day, and that was 4 June. Dr Jonathan Unger and Mr Hong Li Zhien were understandably cited in the article as calling for this correction. However, I presume that they did not have access to all my speech before answering Mr Sheridan's questions about this `startling' construction that he had put on my words. Certainly, I have not set out to give any `startling' new interpretation to these events. This construction on my speech is entirely of Mr Sheridan's making. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I referred to this matter in my speech was that I wanted to refer not only to the 1,000 civilians who died but also to the soldiers' deaths, because I believe this aspect of the Beijing events has been too little heard and too little understood in Australia. Most Australians do not know that about 1,200 army vehicles and public buses were destroyed by sharply increased civilian violence on 3 and 4 June. Most Australians do not know that, besides the several thousand civilian casualties, several thousand soldiers and security officers were injured. They do not know that besides the number of civilians killed, which I estimate to have been about 1,000, many soldiers were also killed, and I estimate that number to be about 100. I believe the full trauma of the Beijing massacre cannot be grasped without reference to all these deaths and casualties. </PARA>

He is a key witness before the bank inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on behalf of those who borrowed under the program known as `managed foreign currency loans', particularly those who borrowed through Westpac Banking Corporation. John McLennan wrote to me today, and I read the following letter to the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday I posted a further submission to the Parliamentary Enquiry relating to the ``PPL'' letters. </PARA>
<PARA> On Friday at approximately 4.00 PM David Elder-</PARA>

<PARA>Yours Faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>John McLennan</PARA>
<PARA>I have before me the court orders raised in the Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division. The court order is No. 1499 of 1991 and it was sought by the Westpac Banking Corporation as the plaintiff and directed at John Ross McLennan as the defendant. The order was sought through Allen Allen and Hemsley, solicitors. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>THE COURT ORDERS that-</PARA>
<PARA>1. The defendant attend before this Court at 2.00pm on 20th February 1991 and be orally examined on matters relating to the identity or description of the person or persons who supplied the defendant with the plaintiff's documents referred to in paragraph 1 of the Schedule to this Order and produce to the Court all documents and things in his possession, custody or power relating to the identity of the person or persons so concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The hearing of the plaintiff's application for the interlocutory relief sought in Orders . . . of the summons . . . be listed for hearing at 2.00pm on 20th February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>It is under the seal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales by order by Judge Powell. The schedule attached to the court order cites the documents that Mr McLennan is being restrained upon as being letters of advice from Allen Allen and Hemsley to Westpac Banking Corporation, including the letter dated 26 November 1987, marked `Absolutely Private and Confidential' and the letter of 11 December similarly marked but, more importantly, any documents generated by Allen Allen and Hemsley on the instructions of Westpac Banking Corporation and, probably most importantly:</PARA>
<PARA>Internal memoranda and internal documents generated by employees of or consultants retained by Westpac Banking Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>The court order places restraints upon the plaintiff. In all there are 17 restraints, the first of which, in brief, restrains the defendant from disclosing or using the plaintiff's confidential information. It secondly restrains the defendant from:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . without the licence of the plaintiff, reproducing or publishing, or authorising, counselling, procuring or directing the reproduction or the publication, of the plaintiff's documents. </PARA>
<PARA>The third restraint is `An order, including an interlocutory order, that the defendant be restrained from offering or exposing for sale or distributing' these materials. The further restraints are listed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>4. An order, including an interlocutory order, that the defendant be restrained from converting, detaining or otherwise unlawfully interfering with any of the plaintiff's property. </PARA>
<PARA>5. A declaration that the defendant has infringed the plaintiff's copyright . . .</PARA>
<PARA>6. A declaration that the defendant has disclosed and misused the plaintiff's confidential information, being the information contained in the plaintiff's documents. </PARA>
<PARA>7. An order that the defendant forthwith deliver up upon oath to the Registrar of the Equity Division of this Court for safekeeping until further order of this Court all copies in the defendant's possession, custody or control, of the plaintiff's documents and any articles, documents or things which reproduce the plaintiff's documents . . .</PARA>

<PARA>13. Damages for conversion and detinue, including exemplary and aggravated damages. </PARA>
<PARA>14. Damages for breach of confidence including exemplary and aggravated damages or, alternatively, an account of profits. </PARA>
<PARA>15. All such accounts or profits and inquiries as to damages as may be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>16. Such further or other orders as the Court sees fit. </PARA>
<PARA>17. Costs. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that this man has been delivered a most potent interference in his entitlement to appear before a committee of the Parliament. In fact, I am advised that this process is in contempt of a committee of the Parliament. I would further advocate and suggest for the deliberation of the Senate that the court orders themselves in support of this process may indeed be in contempt of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a reality that any person who appears or seeks to appear before a parliamentary committee has absolute parliamentary privilege and must not and cannot be in any way constrained. The effect of these orders is indeed to constrain this key witness before the parliamentary inquiry. If it does constrain him in fact, it will be in contempt of the Parliament. Whether it constrains him in fact or not, it has intimidated him and any other witness who may have been intending to appear before such a parliamentary committee. I believe that it is threatening to establish a precedent by which the raising of any writs and subsequent court orders could become a potent and frequently used instrument to contempt any subsequent committee of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I know for a fact that this man feels intimidated and feels constrained, and it is up to us to advise him otherwise. Whether we can insure that others who would have appeared before this Committee will not feel constrained or intimidated as a result of the process laid upon him I do not think we can be so sure. This process is more contemptuous because it is the fifth step along a line of interference in the processes of this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The first action that Westpac took to constrain was a series of injunctions taken out to constrain the publication of documents in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. I sought to table those documents in this Parliament but it was ruled against. </PARA>
<PARA> The second step taken by Westpac to constrain those documents was when Mr Stuart Fowler, the Managing Director of Westpac, appeared before the parliamentary Committee and sought to get back from that Committee the copies of the documents that it had. I argue that that was an attempt to interfere with the processes of that Committee. The argument advanced was that the documents enjoyed legal privilege. I do not argue for one moment that legal privilege is not one of the cornerstones of our society. In essence, it says that any person in this country should be able to appear before his or her solicitor or legal adviser in private, to reveal all and to receive legal advice as to what his or her standing is before the law and that that process be privileged and totally confidential. Quite clearly, that is one of the most fundamental cornerstones of our society. But if the legal adviser goes to the next stage and says, `Certainly you have broken the law, and this is the way to subvert the course of justice as a result of having done that' and block the due processes of entitlement of others who take action as a result of what has been done, that is aiding and abetting and it attracts no privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue that when Mr Fowler presented himself to that inquiry and advanced that argument he knew that those documents attracted no privilege but he advanced that argument in an attempt to get the documents back. I argue that Mr Stuart Fowler, the Managing Director of Australia's largest bank, attempted to interfere with the course of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing that Westpac did along this path was to publish a series of advertisements in Australian newspapers calling back to itself copies of these documents. In publishing those advertisements, it attempted to raise in the minds of average Australians that these documents enjoyed privilege which they did not enjoy and that they could not be used before a parliamentary committee in ways in which they could in fact be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth step along this path was when Westpac made submissions to the President of the Senate and to the Clerk of the Senate that I should not be entitled to table these documents in the Parliament. I respect the ruling of the President that it was in the preservation of the principle of sub judice over and above the public interest. That was the fourth step along a five step path. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth step occurred yesterday when Westpac sought, through the Supreme Court, to restrain a witness from appearing before a parliamentary committee and presenting evidence in his possession. I argue that there is more than a coincidence in the conjunction of time. Mr McLennan tells me in this letter that at approximately 4 p.m. on Friday the Secretary of the Committee advised him that the Committee had released for publication his submission to the inquiry. At approximately 8.30 p.m. on Sunday he was served with summonses supported by a court order which sought to restrain him and which it is reasonable to argue are in contempt of the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which these summonses were served is typical of the manner in which people have summonses served on them all over this country. I was told today by Mr McLennan in a telephone conversation that in the evening at 8.30 p.m., in the dark, he heard noises outside his home. His lady companion went out to investigate the noises. She called upon him to investigate the noises. He did so and people appeared from behind bushes and served him with summonses. This is not the first time that this technique has been used. I suppose it is a way of getting summonses in the hands of someone if the course of the parliamentary process is intended to be perverted. </PARA>
<PARA> I know John McLennan and his involvement in this process. For two years he has diligently assembled the evidence and vigorously pursued the course of justice on behalf of people who will take Westpac and other major banks to court on managed foreign loans. I have no doubt that the conjunction time here is more than a coincidence. I am simply saying that this process is a deliberate contempt of the Parliament and that it is simply one of a series of steps, some of which have previously been contemptuous, and which are designed to keep people out of inquiries and to perpetrate the non-disclosure of what is contained in these key documents which, in the words of the bank itself, are devastating. These are documents which I contend will certainly see the light of day because there is no way that the sub judice principle can prevent them from seeing the light of day when an appeal is heard in the first week of April, when I will table them in the Senate if they are not tabled elsewhere. They are documents which, in the words of senior legal advice to me, are potentially the most devastating documents that he has seen in 50 years in law. </PARA>
<PARA> I advise honourable senators that I will be writing to both the Speaker of the House and to the Chairman of the Committee advising them that I have received this letter of request from a constituent, Mr John McLennan, and advising them that it is my opinion, on legal advice, that these documents substantiate a contempt of the Parliament. I will ask the Speaker of the House to place the matter before the Privileges Committee of the other place and draw the attention of the Chairman of the Committee to what I am advised is a contempt of his Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I will make a few remarks about events in South Africa and how they relate to my recent visit there. On 21 December it was announced in the Parliament by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) that I would be visiting South Africa with the sanction of the Australian Government. Sources in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade say that it might be the first visit of a member of the Australian Parliament since the 1950s that has been sanctioned by the Government. We all know that not only this Government but also previous governments would not sanction official visits because of the policies of apartheid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, I arrived in South Africa at a time of considerable international, as well as domestic, interest within that country because of the speech of F.W. de Klerk, State President, on 1 February. I spent a number of days in Johannesburg and a number of days in Cape Town. I also visited Namibia to lead the Government delegation to the Southern African Developing Coordination Conference annual meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been reported in the press in Australia that I was described as an envoy of the Australian Government. I never was an envoy. I never claimed that for myself, and it was quite a misleading comment to make. Although I had extensive discussions with a full range of people within South Africa, I never at any stage claimed to those people that I was some sort of envoy or representative of the Australian Government in an official capacity, taking messages backwards and forwards. </PARA>
<PARA> During my visit to South Africa I met a wide range of people. I met representatives of the African National Congress (ANC), the Pan African Congress and Inkatha-three of the four main black organisations; and members of the black trade unions in South Africa. I met members of the National Party, the Conservative Party, the Indian party and the so-called coloured parliament; and members of human rights organisations and business groups. I met representatives of the rugby board of South Africa, the cricket organisation and the softball organisation. Included amongst members of the National Party I met was the Foreign Minister, Mr Pik Botha. </PARA>
<PARA> In my limited time there I had an opportunity to visit a number of white suburbs in areas of Johannesburg and Cape Town, as well as the black suburbs in the greater metropolitan areas of both those cities. My first comment and observation on visiting those areas was that I doubt that there is any country in the world that has a greater disparity over wealth or greater inequity between the living conditions of one considerable group of citizens compared with another. The poverty of the black townships is appalling. I said previously in media interviews that, although I have visited countries such as Burma, Cambodia and Ethiopia, the poverty of the black population-particularly the living conditions-in South Africa is as bad as any that I have seen. </PARA>
<PARA> What is most stark is the comparison with the affluence of the white suburbs. If ever there is an indication of the inequalities of apartheid, the living conditions of the white population and the living conditions of the black population clearly demonstrate it. Sometimes, the starkness and the disparity is a matter of only a few hundred metres. From Sandton in north Johannesburg, which is a very affluent white suburb, one travels a matter of a few hundred metres into the black township of Alexandria and sees appalling poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> In all my discussions and observations of South Africa-and I do not proclaim in any way to be an expert after such a short visit-one thing I think I can say confidently is that rapid change is coming to South Africa, and the change is irreversible. Why is this change occurring after such a long period during which the present Government has refused to make any changes at all to the apartheid system? I think there are two reasons. The first is the success of international sanctions. Many people claim that sanctions have not been effective. From all that I heard in South Africa, it is clear that sanctions have hurt the present regime, and hurt deeply. </PARA>
<PARA> We know about sporting sanctions. The importance of sporting sanctions was the psychological impact on the white minority Government and its supporters that they were unable to participate in international sporting events. White South Africans, like Australians and people in other Western countries, have a deep love of their sport, particularly rugby, cricket and other major sports. The fact that they have not been able to play internationally for the last decade or more has had a very big psychological impact on the white population in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade sanctions, although effective, were not as effective as the financial sanctions. Some time ago Australia put forward a report written by the now recently appointed head of the Treasury, Tony Cole, on how financial sanctions could be effective in South Africa. By all accounts, those sanctions have been very effective over the past few years. I was told by many people that in the end it was the financial sanctions that had the greatest impact on the present Government. Those sanctions created the present economic circumstances. The high interest rates, the inability to borrow money from overseas and the disinvestment that took place all created grave difficulties. In the end, even the most recalcitrant supporters of apartheid realised that there was no future for South Africa while these financial sanctions were in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the sanctions were effective because every white person I spoke to requested that sanctions be lifted. If sanctions had not been effective, I suspect that no members of the white population would have asked for them to be lifted. In all the discussions I had with the black population, who undoubtedly suffered greatly from the financial and economic sanctions, it was made quite clear that, despite their suffering, they were more than willing to continue to support the imposition of international sanctions on South Africa because they knew it was the only weapon internationally that would have an effect. </PARA>
<PARA> As effective as sanctions were, one should not forget that the real reason apartheid is now coming to an end in South Africa is that the black people themselves chose not to give in. Despite the intolerable circumstances, the awful repression that went on for 30 years, they never gave in in their fight against apartheid. In the end they made the country ungovernable; they withdrew their consent to be governed by a minority regime. They suffered enormous oppression. I met many people in the leadership of the various black organisations in South Africa who gave terrible accounts of the years they spent in gaol, sometimes detained without trial and held in solitary confinement. Not only black people suffered that penalty but also people of other races, including whites, who opposed apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> The black people over recent years made it clear to the regime that to govern would be impossible and that the cycle of unrest would get worse and worse unless significant and major reforms were made to the way the country was governed. For those reasons, the State President of the National Party Government, F. W. de Klerk, in his major speech on 2 February last year and again on 1 February this year in opening the parliamentary session outlined the changes. The speech this year to parliament was significant in a number of ways. The speech last year could be considered very significant because of the release of Nelson Mandela and the unbanning of the African National Congress and other political parties. This year he announced the repeal of all the remaining legislation that maintains apartheid in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that has not been given due publicity in this country is that he tabled in the parliament a manifesto which he called `the manifesto for a new South Africa'. When one reads that manifesto, at long last one sees a commitment from the National Party, on behalf of the white community which it represents, to a multi-racial, democratic South Africa in which all South Africans will be treated equally; will be part of the one country; will have the right to be governed and be part of the government; and will have the right to universal suffrage and universal franchise. South Africa will have a democratic electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a commitment to human rights-a commitment to have a bill of rights written into the new Constitution. In a way, it is ironic that after 40 years of the ANC and the black community asking for and being refused a bill of rights the white community now wants a bill of rights as a way of protecting the so-called minority views of the country. It means that in South Africa's new Constitution there will be a bill of rights that guarantees the individual liberties that we as a democratic society have taken for granted for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> It was fascinating for me as a politician to be in South Africa during the period around the State President's speech. Society at all levels is now developing in such a way that people argue, debate, discuss among themselves, across communities, between groups of people and organisations as to what sort of South Africa they want in future. In a sense one has a clean blackboard to be written upon about the new society. Publicity has been given in the West about the problems that South Africa faces because some groups in the community are publicly saying they refuse to participate. We have also seen stories here in the press about so-called extreme right wing people in the white community refusing to participate. But while those people maintain that public profile, privately they are also involved in the discussions with other groups in the community about the sort of South Africa that has to be created. We are seeing a society that is being remade and in which new institutions are being created. There are new discussions about the way in which a society with its great political, social and economic problems can be reorganised and governed in a civilised way for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to be over-optimistic about the process, but I do not think that we should be unduly pessimistic. There seems to be an element of goodwill among all the levels of people I met in South Africa. The South African Government has conceded that the present apartheid system is finished and that a new democratic South Africa has to be created. Some people have suggested that there will be a lot of violence associated with this change. I do not think that that will necessarily be the case, although I accept that during the process of rapid and fundamental change in South African society there will be episodes of terrible violence of an indiscriminate nature. But some of it will not be political violence, but straight criminal violence. In a country with seven million homeless blacks and 35 per cent unemployment in the black population, one can understand why there is frustration. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we have had discussions about what the Australian response should be to these changes that are taking place in South Africa. Although I accept that in a formal way we have not reached the stage legally where the abolition of apartheid is irreversible, I think that society in South Africa has reached the stage where it is irreversible. Whatever happens in the Parliament of South Africa, the majority of South Africans, no matter what their race or background, accept that the change is inevitable and that they have to get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> What is Australia's response? I believe that it was reasonable for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) following the State President's speech to suggest that the Commonwealth of Australia should consider putting to the Commonwealth of nations the proposal for a phased lifting of sanctions, subject to certain criteria being reached. The Commonwealth Foreign Ministers met last Friday in London and issued a statement saying that subject to certain matters being triggered, there should be preparations for sanctions to be lifted. What are those triggers? I think there are three very important triggers that cannot be ignored. Despite the announcement about removing the legislative pillars of apartheid, the remaining three areas, namely the group areas Act, the population registration Act and the land Act are not yet through Parliament, although I expect that they will be passed by about May of this year. That is a very important step. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the other important step that has to be taken is the release of the political prisoners in accordance with the Pretoria minute of August last year. By all accounts there are still at least 350 political prisoners in places such as Robin Island who are there for no other reason than their opposition to apartheid in the past. Some of them have already served long sentences. An unknown number of people are still being detained without trial throughout South Africa. I think it is mandatory that the South African Government, in accordance with the Pretoria minute of August last year, release all those political prisoners by 30 April. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with that the South African Government has to reach agreement on the indemnity of the return of political exiles. It has been suggested there are as many as 40,000 political exiles. I do not believe all of them will want to return, but those who do have to be guaranteed indemnity that they will not be prosecuted for their activities against apartheid in the past. I understand that that agreement is close to being reached. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the existing security legislation is not specifically a pillar of apartheid, it is anti-democratic in many of its features. It enables the police to arrest and detain people without trial for long periods. It gives powers to police to search without a warrant. These are all features which we in a democratic society would abhor. They have to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> In each of the above mentioned areas the Government has said publicly and privately that it will reach agreement in the next few weeks. I noticed last week that the State President F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela had a discussion and issued a statement that they had reached political agreement on these sorts of issues. I hope that is correct because it will mean that by about May of this year those matters which are obstacles to further negotiations will have been removed. The Commonwealth Ministers meeting in May can then seriously look at a program of beginning to lift some of those sanctions such as sporting sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think we should lift trade or financial sanctions until we are further along in the process of reaching agreement about the creation of some sort of interim administration which has black representation. Above all else, I think financial sanctions should be lifted only after agreement has been reached on the substance of a democratic constitution and a date has been set for a general election on the basis of an adult franchise. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people, even in the ANC, say that they think it is not too imaginative or fanciful to suggest that by June of next year there can be a general free election in South Africa and a new constitution on adult franchise. Though that speed of change may take our breath away, even people in the ANC believe it is possible and I hope that that timetable can be achieved. I am sure that all members of this Parliament would agree with it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to put on record a personal aspect of my trip. My visit to South Africa had many exciting highlights. I met a range of people, from Nelson Mandela to the Foreign Minister, Pik Botha. The highlight for me at a personal level was being invited to attend an ANC funeral at Sebokeng. In mid-January, at a black township outside Johannesburg, 42 people were massacred in an act of indiscriminate violence. The ANC organised a major mass funeral for those 42 people which I was able to attend. It was held in a dilapidated soccer stadium. There were about 25,000 people present at the funeral. It was a very moving experience. Leaders of the ANC such as Albertina Sisulu and Thomas Nkobe were present. The major speaker was Archbishop Desmond Tutu. All these people made magnificent speeches. When I was given an invitation to speak at the rally it was with some trepidation that I spoke amongst speakers who had made such powerful contributions at such an emotional moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that I will ever have the opportunity in Australia, as I did in South Africa, to speak to an audience of about 25,000 people. When the speeches were finished, to be congratulated on my speech by people such as Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize winner, was an honour that I will not forget for a long time. I will also not forget being at a funeral which ended with 25,000 people singing the ANC national anthem, Sikelele Africa. It was a moment of considerable emotion. At a personal level, I was very honoured to be able to participate in that ceremony. Like everybody else, I only wish it was not necessary because of this indiscriminate violence. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, my observation is that apartheid in South Africa is dead. It will be gone within a couple of years. There will be much agony yet. There will be more violence. There will be many disappointments in that process; but South African society has now reached a stage where it is impossible for the people to put the clock back. I am sure that is something we all welcome. In doing so, I think that we should pay tribute, above all else, to the many black people of that country-and also the many white people-who over 35 to 40 years have never given up the struggle to end what has been one of the worst and most iniquitous systems of racism in the history of the twentieth century.</PARA>
<PARA> It was an honour for me to be in South Africa at this particular time. I look forward to following developments there in the next few months. I also want to say that wherever I went in South Africa amongst the black population it was recognised that Australia has played a major role internationally in opposing apartheid. Australia was always recognised for that. I look forward, maybe sometime in the near future, to being able to visit South Africa when it has a constitution that is democratic and non-racial and all people in that country are free. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I refer the honourable Senator to the Treasurer's National Press Club speech on 9 May, 1990 entitled ``Consumption Tax (and other Myths)''. The Treasurer noted in that speech that, it is not possible to introduce today a fully compensated consumption tax which yields net revenue to further reduce income tax rates. Put another way, after replacing the wholesale sales tax, there would be insufficient revenue to provide income tax cuts and increases in welfare payments large enough to maintain real disposable incomes. In 1990-91, a consumption tax of 12.5 per cent would raise about $8.3 billion after abolition of the wholesale sales tax. The cost of compensating welfare beneficiaries for the higher costs associated with the introduction of a 12.5 per cent consumption tax would be in the order of $2.3 billion. But a further $8.5 billion in income tax cuts (after allowing for the reduction in the personal rates scale that will apply from 1 January 1991) would be needed to compensate income earners for their corresponding loss in real disposable incomes. This is $2.5 billion more than what is available from the proceeds of the consumption tax (general sales tax).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The link between revenue collected and corresponding increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) flowing from any switch to a consumption tax will depend on the coverage of that tax system i.e to what extent presently untaxed goods and services become taxed and changes in rates of tax presently applicable to goods under the wholesale sales tax. The Treasurer noted in his Press Club speech that a 12.5 per cent consumption tax would raise some $8.3 billion after allowing for abolition of the wholesale sales tax and add some 5 percentage points to the level of prices. A consumption tax set at the rate of 7 per cent would increase the CPI by about 1 per cent if the wholesale sales tax were removed at the same time. However, this consumption tax would raise less revenue than what is presently being raised by the wholesale sales tax. That is, the CPI would increase by 1 per cent, but indirect tax revenue would actually fall by about $300 million.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. Part III of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 gives the Reserve Bank the power to collect statistics from corporations subject to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The information collected under the Financial Corporations (Statistics) Regulations dated 18 May 1984 varies for the different categories of corporations. For building societies it includes aggregated statistics on lending and borrowing, selected liabilities, assets, interest rates and selected maturity dissection of borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Act requires that statistics prepared by corporations under Part III be verified by a statutory declaration made by a senior officer of the corporations.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Act relates to financial corporations which engage in the borrowing and lending of money in a major way and whose assets exceed $1 million. Certain classes of corporations are exempt from the legislation, including public authorities, authorised banks, terminating building societies, friendly or benefit societies, medical benefits organisations, life and general insurance companies and trustee companies.</PARA>
<PARA> 2 and 3. My Department is not informed about the liquidity or viability of financial corporations as a matter of course. There is, however, a close working relationship between the Treasury and the Reserve Bank and the Bank keeps it informed of developments relevant to the stability of the financial system. Moreover, the Secretary to the Treasury, as a member of the Reserve Bank Board, receives such information as is provided to other Board members arising from the Bank's surveillance of the financial system.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. I am informed that the Reserve Board receives regular reports on developments affecting the bank and non-bank sectors of the finance industry, and that the information relates to the operations of industry sectors, groups of organisations in a single group and individual entities.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. (a) Yes;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (c) Yes;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Yes, but from a corporation entitled Countrywide Building Society.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Yes, but from a corporation entitled Commercial Credit Cooperative Limited.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Yes, but predominantly building societies in the Group (there are other financial intermediaries).</PARA>
<PARA> 6. I am informed that the Reserve Bank had some discussions about the operations of the Farrow Group with the responsible State authorities. (See responses to parts 9 and 10). These discussions arose from concerns evident in sections of the market.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Governor of the Reserve Bank regularly discusses economic and financial developments with the Treasurer. These discussions may include problems in particular parts of the financial system if the Governor believes that to be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Governor and I discuss the state of the economy on a regular basis and we talk face to face or by telephone whenever particular matters warrant it.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The Bank has told me that it had been generally aware for some time that the Farrow Group of building societies was exposed to a higher-than-normal operating risk because of its high rate of growth, its exposures to the commercial property sector, and its interest rate policy. Such information as was available to the Reserve Bank, however, was not an adequate basis on which to make considered judgements about the societies' viability.</PARA>
<PARA> 10, 11, 12. I did not know of the financial difficulties of the Farrow Group of building societies prior to the release of a statement by the Victorian Treasurer on 13 February 1990 concerning Pyramid Building Society.</PARA>
<PARA> The only advice received by my office prior to 13 February 1990 was a minute dated 12 February which referred to an article on Pyramid that had appeared in the Sunday Herald on 11 February which stated that there had been small net withdrawals from the Society.</PARA>
<PARA> That advice could not be considered knowledge of Pyramid's difficulties. In the event the minute was not drawn to my attention as it was not considered such a serious issue at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> 13. The Reserve Bank has informed me that it had discussions with Victorian Government officials on a number of occasions:</PARA>
<PARA> * On 12 and 13 February 1990-talks initiated by Victorian Office of Management and Budget in relation to its concerns about the risk of a run on Pyramid Building Society and its inquiry about the RBA's policy on liquidity support for building societies.</PARA>
<PARA> * On 15 and 20 February 1990-talks with Victorian Registrar of Co-operative Financial Institutions, initiated by RBA, to inquire about Farrow's efforts to arrange additional lines of support.</PARA>
<PARA> * On 21 February 1990-talks initiated by Victorian Office of Management and Budget to mention Farrow's liquidity difficulties and problems of securing support from banks.</PARA>
<PARA> 14. I understand the Farrow Group had discussions with various financial institutions about possible lines of credit. The Reserve Bank has told me it was not party to any such discussions but it made known to banks and to the Victorian Government its longstanding and on-going policy of willingness to provide necessary liquidity support to banks which choose to lend to well-managed and viable non-bank financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> 15. Not applicable; as indicated in the response to part 14, the Reserve Bank did not give its support to the provision of a line of credit to the Farrow Group.</PARA>
<PARA> 16. The Reserve Bank informs me it did not meet with the Victorian Government in late March or early April 1990. There, however, were numerous discussions between various representatives of the Bank and the Victorian Government during the period from February to June 1990. These were primarily to keep the Bank informed of events as they developed; the Bank did not offer the advice mentioned in the question. I did not participate in any of the Reserve Bank's discussions.</PARA>
<PARA> 17. Not applicable (refer to the response to part 16).</PARA>
<PARA> 18. The Reserve Bank has informed me it did not receive a copy of an audit report by Day, Neilson, Jenkins and Johns; it did receive a copy of Price Waterhouse's summary of its review of the Farrow Corporation Limited group.</PARA>
<PARA> 19. The question is based on an incorrect premise. The Reserve Bank did not see the first document referred to. It neither accepted nor rejected the latter.</PARA>
<PARA> 20. The Reserve Bank does not have the power to intervene in the operations or management of non-bank financial institutions. Its longstanding policy is not to provide financial support to financial institutions it does not supervise.</PARA>
<PARA> 21. I am informed that Farrow Corporation did not make application to become a bank. However, in January 1990, Farrow Corporation indicated to the Reserve Bank an intention to seek a banking licence in the medium term (3-5 years) if certain State legislative restrictions on its activities were not removed. The Bank offered no advice on its equity level, accounts or management arrangements. On 11 May 1990, an officer of Farrow Corporation arranged for Mr Farrow to meet with the Chief of Financial System Division of the Bank on 24 May, purportedly to discuss the possibility of a banking authority. The appointment was cancelled by Mr Farrow on 23 May.</PARA>
<PARA> 22. I have regular discussions about economic and financial developments with both the Reserve Bank Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. There have however been no particular discussions concerning the state of Victorian building societies.</PARA>
<PARA> 23. I receive many requests for meetings during the course of a year, but there is no record of any such contact with the Farrow Corporation in 1990.</PARA>
