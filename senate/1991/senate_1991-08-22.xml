<TITLE>Tobacco Advertising</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.</PARA>

<PARA>1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that I reported on 6 June about the concerns of the Committee with these instruments which related to defects in drafting. These defects were so serious as to affect the validity of all seven Fisheries Notices. Such drafting flaws are a breach of parliamentary propriety. In addition, they affect the personal right of those engaged in the fishing industry to have their duties and obligations clearly set out in any relevant legislation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has now undertaken to redraft the defective parts of the instruments. Mr President, as usual I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the correspondence of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>

<PARA>The Hon Simon Crean MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Primary Industries and Energy</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Simon</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Fisheries Notices Nos. NPF 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 and No. ORF 15, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 6 June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> The Explanatory Statement for Fisheries Notice No. NPF 9 advises that ``Paragraph 7 prohibits the use of specified equipment for taking prawns''. Relevant parts of paragraph 7 state as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``7. Pursuant to paragraphs 8(1) (c) and 8(1) (e) of the Act prohibit the taking of prawns in the area of proclaimed water specified in paragraph 11 of this notice with the use from a boat of . . . [specified equipment] that is not stowed and secured by being unshackled from the warps and brought on deck''.</PARA>
<PARA> The drafting of this paragraph does not appear to effect the purposes of s.8(1) (e) of the Act. It appears that some words have been omitted. This is important because not only does paragraph 9 of the present Notice refer back to paragraph 7, but paragraph 6 of No. NPF 10, paragraph 6 of No. NPF 11 and paragraph 6 of No. NPF 12 refer to paragraph 7. In addition, paragraph 7 of No. NPF 13 and paragraph 7 of No. NPF 14 both refer to ``equipment as defined in Fisheries Notice No. NPF 9''.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a small typographical error in paragraph 3.</PARA>
<PARA> Fisheries Notice NPF 11 refers in one provision to ``proclaimed waters referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5''. There is no apparent reference to proclaimed waters in paragraph 4, which appears to refer to paragraphs 5 and 6.</PARA>
<PARA> Fisheries Notice NPF 12 refers in one provision to ``activities prohibited by paragraph 4''. There are no activities prohibited by paragraph 4. It appears that the provision should have referred to paragraphs 5 or 6 or both. NPF 12 refers in another provision to ``periods specified in paragraph 4''. There are no periods specified in paragraph 4, which should refer to paragraph 5.</PARA>
<PARA> Fisheries Notices NPF 13 and 14 refer to ``equipment as defined in Fisheries Notice No. NPF 9', without further qualification. Most of the substantive provisions of NPF 9 define equipment, as does the interpretation provision and a schedule. It is assumed that paragraph 7 of NPF 9 is meant, but as described earlier that provision is defective. In any event, the cross-reference should be made specific.</PARA>
<PARA> In NPF 14 a provision refers to ``proclaimed waters referred to in paragraphs 4 and 6''. There are no references to proclaimed waters in either of these paragraphs but there are such references in paragraphs 5 and 7.</PARA>
<PARA> Fisheries Notice No. ORF 15, one of 12 Fisheries Notices tabled on 16 May 1991, was not signed. All of the other Notices tabled on that day, and the other 10 Fisheries Notices and Plans of Management made this year, all carry facsimiles of separate individual hand written signatures by the Minister, together with a hand written date. In ORF 15 there is a blank space where the facsimile signature usually appears, although the date is hand written as usual. Therefore, there is at least a presumption that the instrument was never signed and is of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA> All of the Northern Prawn Fishery Notices were made on 19 March 1991, but not tabled in the Senate until 16 May 1991, or 14 sitting days later. Therefore, your early advice would be appreciated.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Migration Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 201 and made under the Migration Act 1958, and the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 148 and made under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement about the concerns of the Committee with these instruments.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present set of migration regulations provides for applicants for certain visas for entry into Australia to be assessed, not on their own individual merits, but upon the basis of prescribed classes. Among these classes are sex, nationality and age. The Committee considered that to grant or deny people a visa on these grounds was such an important step that it may be appropriate for an Act to approve such a course. It is unusual for the Committee to question an instrument on the ground that it may be more appropriate for parliamentary enactment, but this is such a case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present set of occupational superannuation standards regulations provides, among other things, nine detailed tables which set out the valuation factor for superannuation pensions. This, obviously, has important financial consequences for the millions of Australian workers in such schemes. However, there appear to be serious flaws in the tables which make it impossible for an individual to determine his or her entitlements. Mr President, as usual, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement of the concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Migration Regulations (Amendment)</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Rules 1991 No.201</PARA>
<PARA> At present the Minister is engaged in a major review of the Migration Regulations. The Committee understands that the review will be completed later this year. It would be appropriate to complete the review at that time as the parent Migration Act 1958 provides that, unless saved by the regulation itself, regulations prescribing criteria for visas and entry permits shall be taken to be repealed 2 years after the day on which the regulation takes effect. The present Principal Regulations took effect on 19 December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been many amendments since then of the Principal Regulations and of the associated Migration (Review) Regulations. The Committee has carefully scrutinised all of these instruments and has written to the Minister about any concerns it has raised. The Minister has undertaken to take these concerns into account in the final review. The Minister has also responded promptly when the Committee has asked for advice on issues which appeared to require immediate replies, such as those connected with migration regulations effecting Australian sanctions against Iraq. The present Regulations are such a case.</PARA>
<PARA> The present Regulations provide for a ``risk factor'' as an element in the grant of 5 different types of visa. The risk factor firstly relates to whether a particular individual has applied for a permanent residence visa in the last 5 years. The Committee has no difficulties with this provision. However, the second aspect of the risk factor does not relate to the applicant himself or herself. Rather the risk factor applies if the applicant has only one characteristic in common with classes of persons who tend to overstay their visas or entry permits. These characteristics are expressed to be-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) nationality</PARA>
<PARA>(b) marital status</PARA>
<PARA>(c) age</PARA>
<PARA>(d) sex</PARA>
<PARA>(e) occupation</PARA>
<PARA>(f) class of visa</PARA>
<PARA>(g) place of application</PARA>
<PARA> These characteristics appear to be sensitive. Here classes are being used to judge a person rather than judging that person individually on their own merits. Persons are judged for entry into Australia not upon personal conduct but, among other things, upon nationality and sex.</PARA>
<PARA> This is such an important change in the law that the Committee considers that it may be more appropriate for the parent Act expressly to authorise such a provision. It is only rarely that the Committee raises this as a ground for concern about an instrument. However, on the face of it the present instrument is such a case. The Committee has sought early advice from the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations (Amendment)</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Rules 1991 No.148</PARA>
<PARA> These Regulations amend the administration of reasonable benefit limits for occupational superannuation. The Explanatory Statement advises that the amendments are technical in nature and are intended to remove practical difficulties in the administration of these limits.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns with this instrument relate to the clarity and certainty of its provisions. The Committee scrutinises all disallowable instruments of delegated legislation to ensure that they comply with appropriate levels of parliamentary propriety and personal liberty. It is a breach of both of these principles if provisions are drafted in such a way that it is not possible to ascertain the state of the law. In this case the Committee was particularly vigilant as the Regulations in question affect the savings and retirement income of millions of working Australians. As such, it is essential that they be drafted to a standard equal to that of Acts of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The present Regulations insert 9 new Tables which set out the valuation factor for superannuation pensions indexed at particular percentage rates. The Tables are all expressed to be based on the ``Age last birthday of recipient on commencement date of pension''. Each table sets out blocks of ages to which particular factors apply depending on which indexation rate is used.</PARA>
<PARA> However, all the Tables appear to duplicate numbers of ages, such ages being the basis upon which the whole scheme is based. It is thus not possible for an individual to know to which group he or she belongs. Each Table commences ``(age) 20 or less'' and then continues ``(age) 21 to 25'' which appears correct and appropriate. Similarly, each of the 9 Tables ends with ``(age) 75 to 80'' and then ``(age) 81 or more'' which again seems correct. But each of the other 10 blocks duplicates ages, reading ``(age) 25 to 30, 30 to 35, 35 to 40, 40 to 45 . . . ''. In all, 11 ages in each of the 9 Tables are duplicated. On the face of the instrument there are therefore two sets of laws applicable to every person of these ages upon retirement.</PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary propriety dictates that drafting of delegated legislation should be precise and clear. Conversely, those who are affected by such legislation must not be burdened by ambiguous provisions.</PARA>

<PARA>ARTS, SPORT, ENVIRONMENT, AND TOURISM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The original draft of the Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 amends 15 Acts administered in the ASETT Portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments are mainly to make the administration of various Government programs more efficient and cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA>One measure affects a range of programs. The Bill implements for 13 statutory authorities in the portfolio the Government's decision that the Remuneration Tribunal should have jurisdiction over the recreation leave entitlements of fulltime officeholders. Authorities in other portfolios have already been covered by the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The other amendments in the Bill cover specific programs:</PARA>
<PARA>Five statutory authorities will have the value limit beyond which they need to obtain Ministerial approval for contracts and other transactions increased, generally to $250,000: the Australia Council; Australian Film, Television and Radio School; Australian National Maritime Museum; Australian National Gallery; and National Museum of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>An officer of the Navy will be an ex officio member of the Council of the Australia National Maritime Museum, and section 49 of the Museum Act, which exempts the Museum from taxation, will be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA>The 3 representatives of the Convocation of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School on the Council of the School will be appointed by the Council, rather than elected by the Convocation. It is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct an effective election among the more than one thousand members of Convocation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Committee will be made able to hold meetings by conference telephone and similar methods. </PARA>
<PARA>The maximum fee that can be levied under the regulations for an export or import permit under the Hazardous Wastes (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 will be increased from $4,000 to $8,000. The $4,000 limit introduced in July 1990 was intended to enable full cost recovery but experience has shown it is insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA>Further changes were made to the Bill in the House of Representatives during the Debate on 20 August 1991. The first of these is to the recreation leave amendments. A transitional provision will ensure that the rights to recreation leave that the member had prior to commencement are preserved as at the time of commencement, and the unintended omission of the National Capital Planning Authority from the Bill is rectified. </PARA>
<PARA>Addition of the NCPA Amendment, an Australian Capital Territory matter, means that the name of the Bill needs to be changed to the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. Honourable Senators will recall that the first Portfolio Bill of the Department was passed in the Autumn 1991 Sittings of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Government has now decided on the removal of age limit restrictions as regards the appointment, and the continuation of appointment, of non-executive statutory officeholders in the ASETT portfolio. Under a majority of the legislation governing these statutory authorities, a mandatory retirement age of 65 or 70 is currently provided for all members of Boards, Councils, etc., of these authorities. The amendments will remove the mandatory retirement age provision for all nonexecutive members of the governing bodies of the Department's statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum, as well as the two supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to the additional changes I have just described. </PARA>
<PARA>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill makes amendments to the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991, aspects of the Primary Industries and Energy R&amp; Act 1989 concerning the Wool Research and Development Corporation and the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Act 1991 to correct omissions and drafting errors. All of these Acts were passed in the last session of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the amendments to the wool legislation, the Senate will recall that a package of urgent legislation putting in place new arrangements for the wool industry to apply from 1 July 1991 was passed in the last hours of the Autumn Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>On further examination of the legislation and consultations with Attorney-General's Department, it has become apparent that some minor additional transitional provisions are needed. Attorney-General's has advised that the wording of the existing legislation is such that it is not possible to appropriate and transfer to the wool statutory authorities wool tax imposed on wool sold prior to 1 July 1991 but received by the Commonwealth after that date. Clearly, the situation needs to be rectified and the provisions of this Bill do that. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the existing legislation regarding wool tax on wool sold after 1 July 1991 are adequate and do not need amending. </PARA>
<PARA>It is recognised that, as a result of the defect in the legislation, the wool statutory authorities have not had, since early July, access to the flow of wool tax funds which they should have had. They would therefore have incurred additional expense either through interest forgone or through additional interest costs on borrowed funds. The Government considers that the statutory authorities, and through them the woolgrowers, should not have to bear the additional expense caused by the drafting omission. Therefore the Government will pay interest for the period of the delay in the wool tax payments. The Bill provides that the Minister will determine the interest rate to apply and I envisage that the rate will be based on that which the Commonwealth earns on investment of its surplus funds. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes that interest will be payable by the Commonwealth on the delay in payment to the wool statutory authorities of wool tax money received by the Commonwealth immediately before 30 June 1991 but not paid out until after that date, while the legal questions were being resolved. The Commonwealth passed to the Realisation Commission wool tax in this category in late July and early August and relevant portions have, under the regulations, since been passed on to the Wool Corporation and Wool R&amp; Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also an amendment to carry over into the new legislation for wool research and development, provisions to reflect the existing Commonwealth policy of matching R&amp; funds raised by primary industries up to a ceiling of 0.5% of the gross value of production or the amount of levy collected. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides additional transitional arrangements in relation to the establishment of the Australian Dried Fruits Board. The Board commenced operations on 1 July 1991 as a Product Board within the Australian Horticultural Corporation. It was established under provisions contained in the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Act 1991 as part of the reform of Government assistance arrangements for the dried vine fruits industry. Other measures covered changes to dried vine fruits statutory equalisation and sultana underwriting. </PARA>
<PARA>The Board took on the dried vine fruit export marketing and promotion functions of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. It is funded by an export charge imposed on exports of dried fruit. </PARA>
<PARA>The Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1924, which was repealed on 1 July 1991, provided the funds for the former Dried Fruits Corporation. However, a problem has arisen in making payments to the new Board of funds raised under that Act but collected by the Commonwealth after the date of repeal. The Bill will provide for amounts equal to those collected by the Commonwealth to be appropriated to the Board from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Provision is also to be made for interest accruing on these amounts outstanding to be payable to the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has introduced this Bill at the first opportunity to rectify omissions in complex legislation passed at the end of the last Sittings. I appreciate the co-operation given by the Opposition in according this Bill speedy passage to enable the funds to flow to the organisations concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 is to provide transitional arrangements following the package of wool Bills and the establishment of the Australian Dried Fruits Board. When the recent wool Bills were drafted, provision was not made for wool tax due before 30 June but actually paid after 1 July. As a result, about $90m is frozen and cannot be paid to the Wool Realisation Commission, the Australian Wool Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The Government has been able to transfer about $30m through regulation, but needs this legislation to transfer the other $60m. The same problem has arisen with levies collected after the date of repeal of the old Australian Dried Fruit Corporation, which was replaced by the Dried Fruits Board under the wing of the Australian Horticultural Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am most concerned that legislation such as this has been so shoddily drafted and has led to a situation where the Commonwealth Government has felt it necessary to pay compensation for the losses incurred due to the late payment. The compensation will be an amount equal to interest received by the Government while the money has been waiting to be transferred. The shoddy drafting of legislation affecting important Australian industries is becoming a far too common occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> This piece of legislation is not the only issue relating to wool before the Parliament at present. There are regulations that flow from the wool debate and the wool legislation that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, will recall were considered in the dying stages of the last session of Parliament. The Opposition parties strongly believe, from the way in which the opening of wool auctions has gone on since we were here in June, that a maximum of 10 per cent total tax to be paid by woolgrowers is more than enough. This is a very conservative figure. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, I moved this morning a notice of motion to disallow the regulation that the Government has proposed on a 12 per cent tax on wool. This follows the final agreement in the wool legislation between the Government and the Australian Democrats-and you might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, the debate in June when that issue yoyoed back and forth between the Government and the Democrats for quite some time-that the tax remain at a maximum of 15 per cent. The operative level for this year, which will be set by regulation, will be 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> By looking at the falling projection figures for production for this coming season, there will be an ability for the price to remain firm above all the projections that were made a couple of months ago. There will be an ability to sell significant amounts from the stockpile later in the season; therefore, 10 per cent is a realistic figure, given the current financial plight of wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA> During the wool debate, Minister Crean told Parliament that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics believed that a lower levy would result in lower wool prices and, therefore, lower returns to growers. But just four days after this speech by Minister Crean, ABARE issued a new set of figures to show that by reducing the wool tax from 15 per cent to 12 per cent wool growers would be $600 better off for the year. ABARE then claimed that not only would wool growers' returns be up as a result of the lower tax but also farmers involved in all broad acre industries would average an extra $300 a year. Of course, they would be even better off with a 10 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not be supporting a 12 per cent tax when farmers are financially troubled and have problems feeding and educating their children. I hope that the Government will respond to the notice for disallowance that I have given today and that we will see that regulation in fact disallowed, and that the Government will come forward with a regulation far more appropriately set at the figure of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to talk briefly on the Government's alteration of the 3.5 per cent figure for promotion, replacing it completely with regulation. There was no notice or recognition given of that during the dying stages of debate in June. Therefore, the level of wool promotion, which is a significant part of the recovery of wool as a desired world fibre, is at the whim of the Government. That is an unsatisfactory basis for what is a very significant industry promotion activity. We are talking of about $180m a year, based on the reduced International Wool Secretariat budget for this coming year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about having an adequate financial base for promotion and the figure of 2.5 per cent that is to be allocated by the Government through regulation. We will not be attempting to alter that because, with no legislative basis behind the regulation, it is difficult to have an actual allocation for promotion on a stable and secure basis. I also believe that there is a case to be made for some outside evaluation of wool promotion and its effectiveness, particularly in these times of financial difficulty for wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Opposition supports this legislation, However, we are concerned with the sloppy drafting, the inadequate promotion levy and, finally, we strongly object to the regulation of a 12 per cent tax on wool growers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the second reading speech on the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) delivered by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), we were told that it is recognised that as a result of the defect in the original legislation the wool statutory authorities have not had access since early July to the flow of wool tax funds which they should have had. Essentially, that is the reason for this legislation appearing before us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do share the concern expressed by the coalition regarding the need for this legislation. However, I do not share the coalition's naive belief that the tax rates can be disallowed and that all will be wonderful after that. By disallowing the 12 per cent rate, we would be left in a situation which would not have the figure of 10 per cent sitting there prettily but, rather, the existing tax level under legislation of 15 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Tambling's interjection, of course they can re-regulate. It should be recognised that arriving at the 12 per cent level was a difficulty which has resounded around the wool industry for some months now. This level is recognised by all pragmatic people as being the only one which could be obtained. To disallow that would be naive in the extreme. We do not share that position with the coalition. That was all as a matter of aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we do share is the understanding that this legislation has to be passed as soon as possible to clear up the mess which has been recognised by both the Government and the coalition. We do not dispute that recognition. We support this legislation and hope that it can be passed as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, I would like to support the comments of my colleague Senator Tambling and add some of my own. Where we are at now is tidying up the sad throes of what happened in the last hours of the autumn sitting. Once again, in primary industry legislation, as in other legislation, sloppy and careless drafting has created a situation where we need to have this Bill back before us. It certainly does no credit to those people responsible for it. For a period, once again this situation has disadvantaged the industry although, as other speakers have noted, I note that the Government is going to pick up the interest cost for this period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to spend some of time with regard to the tax levels and the position which we arrived at in the last sitting. What we arrived at in the legislation was not a tax of 12 per cent, which is what many people interpreted and tried to sell it as, but a 15 per cent tax with the promise by the Government that in the first year it would be set at 12 per cent. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tambling" NAMEID="6E4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One year only.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, 12 per cent for the one year. I also reiterate, in supporting Senator Tambling in terms of the regulations, that the position we adopted at that particular time is being vindicated day by day as we move into the wool selling season. I put on the public record that figures from the Wool Realisation Commission, show that which are available on a weekly basis, show that in the six weeks from 1 July just over 100,000 bales of wool have been sold at a value of $66,452,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position that the coalition adopted at that time-in terms of the package that we put before the House of Representatives and the Senate, that is, in terms of meeting a 10 per cent tax regime-was that there was a necessity for $76m worth of wool to be released by the Commission, from the stockpile, to the trade at a minimum price of 475c per kilogram clean. Since that time we have seen a price significantly above that, and it remains significantly above that. There is no logical reason to believe that it is not going to remain significantly above that. I would also point out that the outlook in the medium and longer term, with the developments that are occurring elsewhere in the world, vindicates our particular position. The futures market also vindicates our particular position. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not necessary to put a greater tax impost on the industry than is required to do the job. I again ask the Government why, when it set a seven-year realisation program, when the first two years' requirements have already been met, it is now necessary at a time of extreme recession, if not depression, in much of rural Australia, to continue with a high taxing regime in the wool industry. It is having a dramatic impact on the ability of wool producers and the businesses that supply the infrastructure to survive. It can only mean one thing, in terms of our current position, that the Government wishes to get as many people as possible out of the wool industry in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> If we recalculate the figures now in light of what has happened and make some further projections in terms of the realisation of wool and the wool price, we see that it is not necessary even to maintain a 10 per cent tax to do the job that is required. One must question the motives of the Government in terms of the future of individuals within the wool industry. When we come to our replies to the Budget, I shall delve into that a little more. The other point I want to raise is the decision of the Minister to fiddle around with the promotion levy percentage. No indication was given in this chamber or the other place, nor were discussions held about it with the wool industry. It was an arbitrary, unnecessary decision announced out of the blue. Once again, one must question the motives of the Government in taking this step. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that I have been critical of about the Wool Corporation in the past is our effort in marketing and promoting our wool. Not only was it unnecessary to take this arbitrary decision when it was taken but it also indicated a lack of confidence in the Government's position on the wool industry. It seems that the Government is hell-bent on getting the stockpile down and reducing the debt regardless of the medium and long term consequences for the industry. It is necessary to analyse our promotion and marketing efforts. It is necessary to have a very close look at the operations of the International Wool Secretariat. However, that does not mean that we should fiddle around with the promotion levy percentage, which has been an industry standard and agreed by the industry for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that other people will get up in this place and say, `They have reserves. They will top up from those particular reserves'. That is not the point. The point is, firstly, that it was not necessary in terms of what is required to do the job in regard to realisation from the stockpile and, secondly, that it indicates a lack of confidence by the Government in terms of the promotion and marketing of Australian wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Today good news has come out of the Soviet Union. It certainly appears, at least at this stage, to be back on track in moving to become a much freer place and a democratic society. I would suggest very strongly that Australia should be making an all-out effort to get our wool and other products moving back into the Soviet Union and to get the wheels of industry turning again. The Soviets have been and will continue to be a very important trading partner, particularly in terms of wool and wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is not necessary in the wool industry to have a 12 per cent tax to do what has to be done; it is not necessary to put that additional pressure on individual woolgrowers around the country, and in particular in my State of Western Australia where the level of farm debt on an average farm is significantly higher than it is in other States. One must question the long term and medium term motives of the Government's position on the wool industry by having this level of tax over the heads of woolgrowers at this time in a free market. One must also question the Government's motives in fiddling around with the promotion levies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 is the third wool Bill that we have had before us this year. People were aware that the legislation was about to be introduced. Certainly it was advised that this would be taking place when we had the last debate on this topic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to move on to look at some of the comments made by Opposition senators. This week we have seen in our second largest wool purchaser a coup and a counter-coup, and we do not know what will happen in the USSR. We all sincerely hope that democracy will reign in that country, that it will be able to modernise its industry and to find the money to pay the $391m that it has already used in credits to buy the wool in relation to which both our countries have entered into an arrangement. We had a credit arrangement for some $400m; the Russians have already used an amount of $391m this year, and the year has not yet passed. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask the question: what effect will the coup have on their ability to continue manufacturing in future and on the stability of the USSR? We must also ask what effect it will have on some of the other countries in the European bloc. Furthermore, we must ask what effect the coup-and the successful overcoming of that coup by those seeking democracy-will have on China. That question has not been answered or discussed by the Opposition, yet Opposition senators are now saying that we should be lowering the tax on farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very aware, as is every member of this Government, that people in the agricultural industry, especially those involved in wheat and wool, are having hard times. One does not have to be very bright to understand that, and we certainly do understand it. I remind Opposition members that they are basing their calculations on a particular set of figures. I recall from the previous debate in June that the figure of 600c a kilo was the basis of their calculations. I remind them that the figure, based on the sale of wool on the floor at this stage, is some 12 per cent less than the calculations used by the Opposition. This leads to a reduction in the amount of revenue that will be gained by the tax, but Opposition senators are not telling us how they will finance this yet again. I await with great interest the statement to be made by Dr Hewson at 3 o'clock this afternoon on his plans for an alternative Budget and how he will assist the wool industry and the wool sector. I doubt that we will hear anything from him on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, wool sales are softer. The pass-in rate for wool has increased this week; we only have to listen to the ABC to know that. We have been told-and it is a fact-that 100,000 bales in the stockpile have been sold. However, I add that this is the slow time of year for wool sales. Not much shearing has been undertaken in June and July, although it is starting in areas around here. We will see the big sales of wool taking place in October. What will be sold from the stockpile in October when there will be a lot more wool on the auction floor to be disposed of? We must dispose of the wool on the auction floor and not flood the market with wool from the stockpile because that will only make the price softer, the market more vulnerable and reduce the income of primary producers. It is very important for people to realise that the wool industry fluctuates and has peaks and troughs. We are only now coming out of a low shearing time in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to speak for very long, but I think it is important that we do not raise false expectations for wool growers and that we set a tax figure that can be lived up to and that does not have to be justified or tampered with at short notice. Setting lower figures for the wool tax might be all right for five minutes, but what will happen in the longer term? Those opposite are basing their assessments on a whole set of assumptions. They are being typical economists. Economists have three assumptions as the basis for the two figures they wish to arrive at. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not have this attempt to raise and lower the expectations of wool growers. Let us give wool growers some stability in their industry so that they know the market will not be flooded with wool from the stockpile and they will be able to sell their wool at the best price on the market floor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. I did not expect a primary industries Bill to be back so soon in the Budget session. As Senator West also pointed out, this is the third debate on this subject that we have had in a short time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why does the Government only ever have Senator West to speak on rural matters? I admire her fortitude in carrying the whole load of the Government in speaking on these matters. She must be an aspirant for the front bench. A most important industry for Australia in earning export income is agriculture, along with our mining industry, but some of the statements that Senator West made makes me wonder whether she will ever get to the front bench. The figures she gave for shearing dates and the supply of wool must have come from the Orange workers' club. She should understand that, especially in Western Australia and South Australia, most shearing is done in late August and early September. She is wrong when she says that no shearing is being undertaken at present. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that we are back here. I refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Senate will recall that a package of urgent legislation . . . was passed in the last hours of the Autumn Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>We all remember the end of the autumn session quite clearly because it was a shambles. After the legislation had been defeated, I think for the second time, the Government front bench was in disorder: the Manager of Government Business (Senator McMullan) did not know what to do and Senator Cook was all at sea until Mr Crean came up and reorganised them. I do not manage business on our side, but I would have shut the Senate down at that time and sent the Government away to really work out what it wanted to do. The wool tax that is collected after but deducted before 1 July cannot flow through to the right account, and that is the reason we are back here. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are discussing this Bill and harking back to those days, I point out that the Government, in dealings with the Australian Democrats and the Wool Council of Australia on the evening leading up to that debate, did not mention that there would be a reduction in wool promotion from 3 1/2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent. The Government was aware of it; I do not know whether the Democrats were aware of it; and the Australian Wool Council told me that it was partly aware of it, but we were not informed. That was a ridiculous situation that kept vital information away from all the Parliament. The Government's adviser can smile, but it is a fact that we were not aware of that situation. It proved that what Senator Bell thought he had gained that night was just one big fiddle. The Government gave to us with one hand and took with the other. So I am annoyed with the Minister and the Government. The Democrats were probably not aware either, so they should be looking at the reasons why we were not told. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they were completely in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA> The reduction in the long term might not be such a bad idea because I believe that there has been a certain amount of wastage in promotion. Senator Tambling mentioned earlier that some outside private enterprise firm of consultants should look into the amount allocated for promotional activities and see whether it has been spent in the right direction. However, we will debate that issue again at another time. </PARA>
<PARA> I now believe that we can look forward to more competence in the wool industry. In the two months since we were debating this legislation there has been a big change in the clearances on the floor. The price has eased back but not by a large amount. As has already been pointed out by Senator Crane, the stockpile is moving faster than expected. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Eastern Europe with a delegation during the parliamentary break. We had a look at the woollen mills of Poland while we were there and saw that they were vastly out of date. But the Polish are very keen to put in new machinery if other nations can help them and they are very keen for Australia to set up bilateral arrangements in the wool trade. I can see that there will be a great demand for woollen products in Eastern Europe if wool can be processed in a suitable way there. But with the factories those countries have at present, they certainly will not be able to do it. They hope to compete with Italy, Germany and Japan in the short term. I believe that they cannot. I told them when I was there that they should concentrate on manufacturing products that would be suitable for those colder climates. </PARA>
<PARA> Confidence has returned to the wool industry. Senator West said a little earlier that we should not be increasing or decreasing the hopes of wool growers. Wool growers have shown confidence in the industry and that is proven when we look at the prices being paid in the saleyards. One and a half year-old bare shorn wethers in April, May or even as early as February were fetching about $3. Last week in Merredin they fetched nearly $20. Old ewes are now selling for around $7 or $8 whereas only a few months ago they were in the shooting category. I believe that the growers have their confidence back. They do not rely on what we say or do not say about their confidence in their industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we will have another debate on the regulations a little later, so I will reserve my opinions and arguments as to why we could have done with the 10 per cent levy for which we argued so forcibly when the debate centred on that point. I believe that the passage of time in the two months since that debate has proven that we were right, but we will debate that issue when the regulations come before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we are debating the correct levy for the wool growers. Senator West, in her contribution, mentioned that the Opposition's figures referred to 600c per kilo for clean wool. I categorically deny that, and Hansard will show that when we put down our figures, which were never doubted by anyone, our figure was 475c a kilo for clean wool. Our second important figure was that we believed $76m worth of wool should be sold from the stockpile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at those two figures under the current situation, we find that the present price is 540c for clean wool. We have already sold 100,000 bales from the stockpile to the value of $66m this season, so we are far ahead of what we put up as very conservative figures. Our very conservative figures resulted in a 9.1 per cent levy, which is not even 10 per cent. We had 0.9 per cent cushion effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator West also spoke of the coup in the USSR and said that because of that coup, which has already been reversed, the Government saw it as necessary to have a 12 per cent levy. If, because of a coup, the Government saw it necessary to put up tax and every other levy imposed on people in the community, we would have chaos in this country. There is no need for growers to have to pay any more levy on their wool than what we set originally at 10 per cent. We know that wool production, even on our own estimation, is down further for the next season. Senator West did not mention that. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of wool growers and the agricultural community generally is so dreadful at the moment that the Government saw fit to introduce in its Budget special welfare conditions for growers. That is because the Government taxes them so heavily and has put the levy up unnecessarily high. The Government takes with one hand and gives back as welfare with the other. It is high time this Government got off people's backs, let them work and produce and not tax them out of existence. The Government should not continue with that additional, unnecessary 2 per cent levy, after very obvious figures have been brought to its attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate, who is taking responsibility for this Bill, is well aware that we have heavy drought conditions in Tasmania. The farmers are presently unable to get wheat from the Wheat Board to feed their sheep. They are paying more than $185 a tonne for wheat plus delivery to feed their sheep-not to make bread for human consumption, but to feed their sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate knows that, he should be aware of that situation, yet he is taking responsibility for this Bill and telling those farmers that they will have to pay an additional 2 per cent levy, which is totally unnecessary, in order to foot the bill of the stockpile. The wool has been selling far better than we had anticipated. Our original figures were very conservative and they produced a 9.1 per cent levy. Those figures have now proved to have been too conservative. We are doing far better than we had anticipated and, as a result, the levy should be 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If the situation deteriorates, as Senator West says it could, with a worldwide collapse, the Government would be able to increase the levy. But the Government has chosen to get rid of the small farmers that it believes should be got rid of. Because the Government will not survive, it has chosen the easiest way to get rid of the farmers and give them a special welfare handout. Honourable senators on that side of the chamber may well believe a handout is the best way to keep the people under control; we believe that a hand-up, not a handout, is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just been given the new figures for feed wheat in Tasmania. As I have said, last June it cost $185 per tonne. Does Senator Tate know what we are presently paying in Tasmania for wheat to feed the sheep? We are now paying $230 per tonne plus freight. If the Minister believes the small wool growers can survive paying that in a situation of drought, while the Government is levying 2 per cent more than is necessary, all I can say is that he is trying desperately to get rid of the small wool grower and trying to create just a group of large wool growers which would continue to be happy paying the higher levy in the short term because it knows that it would survive anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to speak only very briefly now because we will have an opportunity later next week to talk more fully about this legislation and the regulation that is to come before the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 is really a major embarrassment to the Government because, in essence, the draftsmen, those in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) have allowed, through very sloppy drafting, burdens to be put on the wool industry which simply should not have occurred. The legislation was rushed through last session and has now prevented the new wool bodies from collecting some $90m worth of wool tax. The result has been an additional cost to the Government in the form of extra expenses associated with forgone interest and additional interest costs on borrowed funds. The Government also has to pay interest for the period of delay in the wool tax payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is only fair that those who made the mistake should now bear the brunt of the costs of rectifying it. It is an indictment on a government which, from the beginning to the end, has bungled the wool industry debate. Its entire approach to the wool industry, going right back to the first rumblings of a lowering of the floor price, has been sloppy, careless and costly. The wool industry is Australia's premier industry and this is how this Government treats its premier industry. As I have said, it is an indictment on the Government. As Senator Crane has said, it does no credit at all to the Government in these very tough times. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is still in crisis. We have uncertainty in wool sales, major problems in the disposal of old ewes, and a major crisis in the income levels for thousands of growers. Some growers will have income drops of 50, 60, 70 and 80 per cent compared with last year. The Government's attitude is to say, `Well, tough luck'. The Government has provided nothing in the Budget which it brought down a couple of days ago other than an admission of failure.</PARA>
<PARA> Look what the Government did in that Budget: a 24 per cent reduction in funding for primary industries and energy from $2.32 billion down to $1.76 billion; a reduction in road funding of $36m in real terms on top of the 30 per cent reduction by the Hawke Government in the last seven years; and a 7.2 per cent increase in fuel tax collection this year, following on from the 90 per cent increase in the last seven years. All of these things slug the wool growers. There is a reduction in the tax zone rebate in real terms for the fifth year in a row; a 34.4 per cent increase in primary industry charges for people who can ill afford to pay many of the charges which are not even competitive; and an increase in fringe benefits tax to 48.5 per cent, which will further discourage people from moving to remote areas of Australia to work. There are no incentives in the health area; there is an assets test on family allowance; and a predicted increase of about 100,000 people on the unemployment heap. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the help that the Government could have given to the people of Australia and all of the things it could have done to get the macro situation right in Australia, it has done nothing to get incentive back into the rural areas. The Government has no answers for the wool growers; I believe it has given up trying. All that it has offered is more money to help wool growers get out of primary production-in other words, more money for rural assistance. That is really admitting failure rather than giving money up front and giving incentive and help to people so that they do not need rural assistance at the end of the day. The Government has offered no incentives, no direction and no alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, bungled the industry. He was very well liked-he is one of the most personable and likeable people around-but as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy he presided over what was once a great industry and let it fall gradually into decay. </PARA>
<PARA> This week the Government has once again demonstrated very clearly what it thinks of rural Australia. I believe this Government thinks that the people who live in country areas just do not count. We have diminishing numbers of farmers and those diminishing numbers are obviously of little consequence to this Government at the moment. It does not care about the children who have been forced to pull out of school because their parents cannot afford to send them to school any more. It has no answers to what happens to them. I believe incomplete education will create difficulties when they are seeking jobs. We talk about the clever country, yet we will have a shrinking rural economy which will be unlikely to have room to employ people. This Government is building a problem of massive proportions in the bush. For those people in the bush, it is no longer a recession; it is a depression. I have not seen anything on the horizon-either in the Budget this week or in the attitude of the Government-which will get things going again. I will quote a few things that Mr Sinclair said during the debate in the other place. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think many people understand the extent to which wool incomes and wheat incomes-two of the primary sources of income in rural Australia-are going to continue to contract. Farmers will find when they get their annual income this year that their expectations are going to be significantly underrealised. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how it is. I have a son working a property; I do the budgets with him. It would be a good idea if a lot of people forgot about listening to and reading what ABARE says is happening out on the farms and went to see what is actually happening to the farmers of the future. </PARA>

They should meet with real farmers-not the ones who want to set up for a television camera-who just want to tell the politicians, the parliamentarians, how it really is. Mr Sinclair went on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Without going back into it all, we should remember that the crisis in the wool industry is largely the result of decisions taken by this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>It was this Government which put the uncertainty into it in the first place. The new President of the National Farmers Federation recently called for woolgrowers to `put industry and political trauma behind them and to concentrate on rebuilding their industry'. These are words of courage and of leadership but, frankly, how can growers put the political trauma behind them when the Government which writes the legislation keeps bungling it? How can growers put industry difficulties and income instability behind them when they face the consequences of the collapse of their industry every day?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government, I believe, ought to have provided in the Budget this week incentives and opportunities for growth and investment. It did not. Instead, it gave us despair, a deficit, a predicted 10.5 per cent unemployment rate, a tax higher than what it needed to be on the woolgrowers and a promotion levy less than what it has been in the past. I support Senator Tambling, who led this debate for the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate to which many members of the Opposition have contributed. I am sure that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, will avidly read their contributions and, while not necessarily agreeing with what they have said, nonetheless, respect the sincerity with which the contributions have been put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 is fondly called the `the Wool Bill'. The Bill enables wool tax imposed on wool sold prior to 30 June this year, but collected by the Commonwealth after 1 July, to be paid to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the Wool Research and Development Council and the Australian Wool Corporation, as is appropriate in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the Commonwealth to pay interest at a rate determined by the Minister for the duration of the delay because the statutory authorities will have been without the flow of wool tax moneys which they should have had since early July. In addition, the Bill includes amendments to give effect to the Commonwealth's policy of matching research and development funds raised by primary industries up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production or the amount of wool tax collected, whichever is the lesser. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has agreed to give the Bill a speedy passage, and we thank it for that. The Government has a responsibility to take prudent decisions on the rate of the wool tax to balance the best interests of woolgrowers and taxpayers of this country. The rate of wool tax is only one part of the Government's overall strategy for reducing the wool stockpile and restructuring the industry on a sustainable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally simplistic to argue that reducing the wool tax from 15 per cent to 10 per cent is of benefit to the grower. If the tax is less, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission has less to operate with. The Commission then has to put more wool on to the market, which, of course, depresses the market and reduces the returns to growers. It is therefore wrong when it is said that woolgrowers would be better off with a 10 per cent tax. More importantly, because the Senate cannot make an amendment to a money Bill, the intention of the Opposition's disallowance, if successful, would raise the tax to 15 per cent. With those remarks in reply to the second reading contributions of honourable senators, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a number of questions to ask the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I refer to the query that I foreshadowed in the second reading debate yesterday about clause 10 of the Freedom of Information Amendment Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ought to give a little background to this. The Government amendment, which makes it a requirement that requests by public servants seeking information relating to their employment matters should first of all be dealt with through internal avenues, arose from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Basically, that Committee accepted that Public Service guidelines provide a less costly and less formal means for public servants to seek access to staff records and that they should be encouraged to use Public Service guidelines in most cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 10 of the Bill provides that a public servant must use internal agency procedures to get access to personnel records before using the Freedom of Information Act to seek such access. Clause 10 does include some safeguards to prevent agencies abusing the provision. If the agency does not make a decision on access under its internal procedures within 30 days of a request by a public servant, that person may then make an FOI request. If the agency refuses to grant access under its internal procedures, the applicant can make an FOI request and pursue the appeal rights provided by the FOI Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to get the balance right. I understand part of the concern that Senator Spindler is expressing, but the Senate Committee envisaged that the balance would be better served by encouraging public servants to use Public Service guidelines rather than the FOI Act which, as I say, ought to be the last resort after internal agency procedures have been attempted but have not produced the information sought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this case I believe that the Government's drafted amendment considerably exceeds the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. That Committee said that employees should be encouraged in most cases to use internal procedures first. The Government's amendment puts a clear and unequivocal obligation on the employee to do that. I believe that it is far in excess of the measure recommended by that Committee. I would like to pursue this matter with the Minister a little further and ask whether there is any way that regulations can be provided, in view of this amendment, which make it feasible for an employee still to be heard through the FOI process if he or she has not first used internal channels.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a second inquiry to pursue. It relates to clause 14. I ask the Minister, firstly, in view of the fact that an agency is now able to delete material from documents on the ground that the material is irrelevant, will the applicant be advised that the material has been deleted because it was considered to be irrelevant? Secondly, what recourse, if any, has the applicant if that person wishes to dispute the judgment of the agency concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has ruled that the existing Freedom of Information Act requires an agency to decide whether to disclose the whole of the document covered by a request, even if it is clear that the applicant is interested only in obtaining access to part of the material in the document. This has disadvantages. The agency is required to use resources in making a decision about disclosure of material which it knows the applicant has not asked for, and the applicant is required by the FOI charges regulations to pay $20 for every hour spent by the agency in reaching a decision on the disclosure of the material that that person has not asked for which, obviously, is rather odd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, the Committee recommended that the FOI Act be amended to permit agencies to delete material that is irrelevant. Clause 14(a) of the Bill amends section 22 of the Freedom of Information Act to allow an agency to delete material from documents where the material is irrelevant to the subject matter of the applicant's request. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee-we are now getting to Senator Spindler's concern-also recommended that decisions to delete material on the ground of irrelevancy be reviewable. The Bill, therefore, provides that the applicant must be informed that material has been deleted on the ground of irrelevancy and provides that the applicant may seek review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Commonwealth Ombudsman. New subsections 55(1) and 57(1) are relevant to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that reply. I wish to raise a final query with reference to clause 15 which permits an agency to refuse a request which would involve a substantial and unreasonable diversion of the agency's resources.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before answering that question specifically, I should indicate that section 24 does not simply allow refusal of a request merely because it involves a substantial workload. The agency must be able to show that the request would unreasonably divert its resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are various safeguards to prevent abuse by agencies. There is the requirement for consultation with the applicant. A statement of reasons has to be given to the applicant indicating that the processing would be substantial and, therefore, unreasonable in terms of the diversion of agency resources. New subsections 55(1) and 57(1) will allow an applicant to challenge the agency's decision as to whether the workload is unreasonable before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Commonwealth Ombudsman. </PARA>

I note, however, that the occasion for the second reading debate has now passed and the obligation upon the Government to make any remarks passed with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not consider my comments to be at all unfair. In fact, I find what the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Cook) says to be quite insulting to the Senate. All of these matters are set out in Hansard, which is now readily available and has been distributed. The Minister would have had access to the Senate pinks last night in order to follow through all the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it insulting to the Senate that the Minister has not been able to be briefed on a considerable number of issues raised by, as I mentioned earlier, six senators in the debate on the second reading. It was quite within the parameters of reason that the duty Minister last night, who had officers present, could have addressed each of the issues raised. Similarly, the officers present could have quite adequately briefed the Minister overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that some other honourable senators will now want to come into the chamber and perhaps regurgitate the issues and questions they raised and the challenges to be met by the Minister. I give an example of some of the points I raised. I quote from Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I will certainly ask the Minister to substantiate the criteria that he would wish to see applied by AQIS, particularly with regard to matters affecting the duration of quarantine, fees at the commencement of service and the acceptance of fee fluctuations not to exceed the consumer price index over the corresponding period. There needs to be a clearly established relationship which sets out with the intending client a clear and agreed set of criteria in respect of conditions that would prevail throughout the agreed service period. I will certainly ask the Minister to give consideration to this matter and for those organisations that have dealings with AQIS to have a watertight contract.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly look for a response with regard to the way in which the contracts and arrangements could be brought to bear. I then raised a number of issues that were not specifically related to the impact of this legislation on the goat area but which will be affected and caught up by the legislation. Those issues will have impacts on plant importation by horticulturalists in northern Australia. I spent considerable time in the debate outlining that. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Minister will be in a position in his response to address a number of these issues . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that we pursue those issues. I hoped that the Minister would have taken the opportunity overnight to have been adequately briefed on those issues because I am well aware that AQIS and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy have been challenged for some considerable time. In fact, in the Northern Territory there has recently been a review of the post-entry plant quarantine facilities. Honourable senators would be well aware of the recommendations of that report because they have received wide media publicity. Specifically, there were five recommendations. I will read them and ask for a response:</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 1</PARA>
<PARA> That a Government Post-entry Quarantine (PEQ) facility continues to be located in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 2</PARA>
<PARA>2.1 That one or more new PEQ screenhouses be constructed to withstand cyclonic conditions, utilising the most appropriate design and equipment taking into account local and worldwide expertise.</PARA>
<PARA>2.2 That houses Nos 3 and 4 be further substantially modified and equipped to improve humidity, air movement and temperature. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 3</PARA>
<PARA> That the responsibility for management and operation of the growing of plants in the PEQ facility be transferred from Quarantine and Inspection Branch (QIB) to DPIF Plant Industry, together with appropriate resources, under supervision of QIB to ensure that quarantine security is not jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 4</PARA>
<PARA> That AQIS consider insecticidal dipping rather than Methyl bromide fumigation as the standard treatment on arrival for tropical fruit trees of unknown sensitivity to fumigation.</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 5</PARA>
<PARA>5.1 That the system for charging for importation and PEQ of plants be changed.</PARA>
<PARA>5.2 That a reasonable fee for services performed on arrival be payable at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>5.3 That a further fee be payable in respect of plants which successfully establish in PEQ and that no further fee be payable in respect of plants which fail to establish. </PARA>
<PARA>The Cattle Council of Australia, in correspondence with Minister Griffiths, has also brought matters to the Government's attention. I have certainly seen a copy of correspondence to the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr Bruce Lloyd, in which the Cattle Council proposed a possible amendment, which we did not proceed with, after consultation with the Clerks, because of certain difficulties. It is the basis of the information that I am seeking from the Minister. I quote from the request of the Cattle Council letter:</PARA>
<PARA>``The provider of quarantine services (AQIS) will establish in concert with the intending client a clear and agreed set of criteria in respect of conditions that will prevail throughout the agreed service period. </PARA>
<PARA>The criteria would include . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These are points that I made in my speech in the second reading debate yesterday, with requests. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>* the duration of quarantine</PARA>
<PARA>* the fees at commencement of service</PARA>
<PARA>* acceptance of fee fluctuations not to exceed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the corresponding period.''</PARA>
<PARA>I have just highlighted a number of examples of questions that I posed. Five other senators raised in the second reading debate issues that ought properly to be addressed, and I look forward to the Minister's response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fairly obvious that the Minister played no part in the debate last night and was not even interested in it. He is now trying to escape any responsibilities he might have in this area. I guess that he has no real interest in primary industries in any case. It is fairly clear that he took no notice of what anyone said. It should be obvious to him, if he listened to the speeches-or if he had been advised by the duty Minister-that a lot of the matters raised by my colleagues and me have consequences. They relate to this Bill and this Bill has consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raised at length-and if the Minister paid any attention he will know the background to it, so I will need only to mention it briefly today-the question of whether it would be possible for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to propagate bud wood and grow lots of trees while it was in quarantine. In that way, when the bud wood came out of quarantine it would be available for immediate sale, rather than having to wait two years and then an extra three years-which might be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess one of the reasons why this was not possible before was that the Quarantine and Inspection Service may have been a bit concerned that it would never be paid for doing this. This Bill is all about that. The Quarantine and Inspection Service could hold the trees until they were paid for or, if they were not paid for, it could sell the trees-and there is a ready market in the instance I talk of. It could readily sell those trees and get its money back. In so doing, it would be helping the Australian stone fruit industry. It would be allowing the Australian stone fruit industry to get its produce, its new varieties, off the ground and in competition with overseas fruit two or three years earlier than now applies. That is a very legitimate question. It is directly related to this Bill, and I would like the Minister's comment on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major point I raise, although it is not quite as directly related to this Bill-again, it is related to stone fruit, which is related to that other matter-is why Australian growers are banned from using antibiotic sprays on their stone fruit. I understand that the reason for that-although it is not quite in this Minister's portfolio-is that the Government does not want Australians eating antibiotic spray because it builds up our resistance to antibiotics, so we ban it in Australia. That puts Australian producers at a severe disadvantage. But if the reason for banning the spray was correct, why do we then allow the sale on Australian shelves of overseas fruit that has been treated with antibiotic sprays, and not too long ago-not long enough for it to break down? We are still eating the antibiotic spray, but on foreign fruit. Our fruit producers are put at a severe disadvantage as a result. That was a subsidiary point which I made in my speech that the Minister might like to comment upon also. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not consequences of the legislation. It is well known that quarantine is a controversial matter in rural Australia because there is a major lobby in rural Australia which would like to use the Quarantine and Inspection Service as a non-tariff block to the entry of goods that are in competition with products produced in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an open debate. We do not have to have ohs and woes and interjections about that. That is a fact; we all know that is the case. We can have a debate about that; we can have a debate about bud wood; and we can have a debate about whether we transform the Quarantine and Inspection Service-which is retained at taxpayers' expense as a service to protect Australians from the importation of disease, a service that quarantines items coming into Australia so that we can be sure that they do not transmit disease-into a service that does those things as well as farming, propagating and breeding the particular items or animals that come in. That would change the very nature of the Quarantine Service quite dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest, in all humility, that if honourable senators here are serious about wanting to pursue those questions, then we can have a stint in the chamber in which those matters are raised and I will deal with them in the way I have; or they can pursue the matters seriously by making the proper representations in the proper way. If honourable senators were to adopt the second of the two alternatives, it seems to me that that would be a more responsible course than if they simply used these items as a way of disrupting the proceedings of this debate and making a political point. That seems to be an exploitation of the seriousness of the issues that they raise and a perversion of those issues for political purposes, rather than an effort to try to resolve those issues in a serious and constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA> So I make this plea: let us get on with this Bill and deal with the charges elements of it. I am sure that the Minister will be available for discussion of the matters that honourable senators wish to raise. If they then wish to ask about those matters in the form of questions on notice and receive written replies, I am sure that he will oblige them in that process-nay, he is bound to. If honourable senators want to pursue these matters in the Estimates hearings, that is also a forum in which they can do so. That process is only about one month away. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the Bill before this chamber is about people who can take animals out of quarantine without paying their bill, thus requiring the Quarantine Inspection Service to pursue them at law for the debt that they owe the Australian taxpayer and cart these people through the court systems at great delay and at considerable loss. It would seem to me that the ability of the Quarantine Service to hold on to those animals until people pay their bills, which is what this is about, might be something that this chamber can give expedition to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is trying to avoid answering questions which were legitimately addressed at the substance of what this Quarantine Amendment Bill 1991 is about. To ensure that we do stay with what is germane to the Bill, I point out that I referred to the Bills Digest in my speech on the second reading and I again refer to that journal to give guidance to what might be a relevant question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During my speech I quoted from that Bills Digest and I quote two words again. I accept the explanation and agree that it is an accurate explanation of what the main provisions of this Bill are about. In writing about two clauses, clauses 3 and 4, the Bills Digest mentions the words `the expenses'. My question and the question that a number of importers want answered is `which expenses?'. Before they enter into an agreement with AQIS, they want to know what expenses we are talking about. That is not an irrelevant question; it is entirely germane to this because it is of great concern to somebody embarking upon an importation program or somebody who is importing animals into Australia to know what expenses we are talking about. That is essentially the substance of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling quoted from a suggested amendment to this legislation which was put up by the Cattle Council and which was endorsed by us but unable to be delivered. We understand the reasons why. But although it is unable to be delivered, we want the concerns that were expressed in that attempt at an amendment answered here and now by the Minister. That is a legitimate question. I do not know where the Minister has run off to, but if we have frightened him away with the question, perhaps somebody else will be able to take up the battle for him. I have asked the question. That is all I can do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has misinterpreted a few of the questions. It surprises me that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has not actually briefed the Minister before he came into the chamber. The Minister made the point a minute ago, when replying to Senator Macdonald, that some of the questions were not relative to the Bill that is before us at the moment. But he did make the point that the fees are charged and then the Government can get those fees remunerated to it. I believe that my questions are quite relevant. In my speech yesterday I asked this question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I wonder whether they were able to negotiate a price for the agistment of their stock in quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely if the importers are going to have to pay back fees for something, then they also should be able to know whether they can negotiate a price or whether it is a set price and one is going to cop it-I do not know what they are going to do. Maybe it would help if I stop for a minute so that the Minister can listen. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cook" NAMEID="RF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard the question. I have got two ears; I can listen with both of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As long as the Minister listens with both ears and only talks with one mouth he will be right. Another question I asked the Minister in my speech was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What opportunity has the importer to determine a fair and equitable price for the cost of boarding animals?</PARA>
<PARA>This is aside from actually agisting animals in quarantine. These are very serious questions. If one is going to get the money back afterwards it is all a part of it. If those fees are extortionate, obviously it is going to mean that someone will not be able to pay some of the fees afterwards. I also stated yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe the Minister will be able to explain that at the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought, with respect to the Minister's advisers, that the Minister would have come in today and answered that question. Another question I asked was:</PARA>
<PARA>In the event of a dispute, who actually will be the arbiter?</PARA>
<PARA>Who does one go to? Who is the person that an importer goes to if he believes that the fees have been unjustly charged; if the agistment rate is higher than it should be; if the boarding fees are higher than they should be; or if the animals are kept there longer than they should be. Who is going to be the arbiter? Further on in my speech I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>On the Government's side-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, looking after its interests-</PARA>
<PARA>what is to stop an importer running up a large bill and then, anticipating that the price at the subsequent auction of the livestock might be less than the import bills, waiting for the auction and paying the lower price?</PARA>
<PARA>That was another question. I then also asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Another area of the Bill that concerns me is that those who import the livestock are going to be at the mercy of whatever fees the Government chooses to levy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what has happened in the past. I would like the Minister to assure me on this aspect because he knows that I have had a long interest in this matter, going back to the time when the Minister was responsible for the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that really astounds me is in respect of the interest charged. I believe that in previous cases it was 20 per cent. Is 20 per cent still the interest rate charged, is it bank rates, or does the Government have a special interest rate fee set? In the past I have asked why it has been set at 20 per cent. It is all part of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question I asked was whether it is and whether it can be fair and equitable when there is no choice for people. It is a monopoly. The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service in Australia is a monopoly, and monopolies tend not to create an atmosphere of affordability or equity. Therefore, how can anyone get a guide as to what are fair and equitable fees in the quarantine timing? Everyone is being sincere. We are not trying to hold up the Minister or anyone else; we are just trying to get some facts and figures before we go further with the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some concerns which relate to the provisions of the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1991 in so far as they concern the importation of sheep and goats. To some extent, they mirror the concerns of my National Party colleagues Senator Tambling and Senator Brownhill, but they are slightly different. Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the inclusion within section 64 of the principal Act, the Quarantine Act 1908, of subsection 3 which relates to the importer making an agreement with the Commonwealth in respect of the release of the plants, animals or goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subsection 4, which is also contained in clause 3 of the Bill, provides for the payment of interest at a rate not exceeding 20 per cent per year. I am very concerned, however, that there seems to be no guideline within the Bill for the setting of that interest rate. It is clearly not by delegated legislation; there is supposed to be an agreement. I have been approached by importers of goats who have a concern that they are going to be held to ransom on the interest rate. Certainly, a ceiling of 20 per cent could easily become a rate of 20 per cent, should the Commonwealth so choose. The effect of this legislation means that one would not be allowed to import the animal if one did not make the agreement with the Commonwealth because one would not be able to have the animal in quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, I am very concerned that there is no mechanism here for setting the interest rate. Given that we could be talking about quite long periods of time in which animals may be in quarantine, I would appreciate the Minister's advice on the manner in which the interest rate is to be determined under the new subsections (3) and (4) of section 64 of the principal Act. That is my No. 1 concern. </PARA>
<PARA> My other concerns relate to the manner in which the charges will be determined because, again, we have importers dealing with a monopoly, which is the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I have no difficulty with that. However, there is no guarantee that the Quarantine and Inspection Service is necessarily running itself efficiently. One of the concerns, for example, is that if one has sheep or goats and they are breeding progeny in quarantine, they are held for a minimum of five years to determine whether they have scrapie. That is fine but, of course, one can get a substantial charge building up, especially when one could end up with as many as 30 to 40 animals for every one that was imported at the end of that five-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need an assurance or some advice from the Minister on how the charges will be determined and whether the importers will be asked to pay for any inefficiencies that may exist within AQIS. That is of great concern when one talks about the increase in progeny over that five-year period in which progeny will be quarantined to wait to see whether there is any scrapie. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bell asked whether the syndicates were advised of the possibility of an increase in fees. Seminars were held by the Department in late August 1984 for the syndicates that were holding sheep and goats at the Torrens Island quarantine farm. At those seminars the syndicates, all importers and owners, were told that although it is intended that the annual fee remain at $75 per animal during the full quarantine period, circumstances may arise which will demand a review-that is, when costs substantially outstrip revenue collected-and that the Minister, therefore, reserves the right to increase this fee if it is deemed necessary. That answer to what formal advice was offered to the syndicates needs to be seen against the normal practice of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in setting its fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Brownhill and Senator O'Chee asked questions about how the fees are determined; whether we know that the Quarantine Service is efficient; whether people are asked to pay for inefficiencies; and the interest rate charge and who determines it. I think that is the range of questions put. </PARA>
<PARA> The fee charged is a cost recovery fee. The Quarantine Service is a service provided to the Australian community to prevent foreign diseases coming into this country. For people importing animals or material, which may bear or run the risk of bearing foreign diseases, they import in the knowledge that there will be a quarantine requirement before they make the decision to bring into this country the particular animal or material. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice of the Quarantine Service is to advise people doing that in advance of what the charges would be so that they can make a commercial judgment, knowing what the charges are likely to be, as to whether it is a profitable enterprise for them to import this animal or material. That is the normal and usual practice. They know, if the animal or material is to be retained in quarantine for a period, what the reasonable charge will be and they can make a proper commercial assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of what interest rate charges are made, I have to say by way of explanation that the interest rate charge we are talking about is an interest on people who have not paid the fee. It is an interest on the outstanding moneys that ought to have been paid at the appropriate time when recovery is undertaken. We are not talking about an interest on people who pay fees at the appropriate time. We are talking about people who are in arrears and who ought to have paid but did not. If interest was not charged, a loss to the Department-that is, the taxpayer-would be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The interest that is charged at the present time is 20 per cent. It is not an interest charge that is determined by the Quarantine Service. It is an interest charge determined by movement in the appropriate interest rate scales and advised by the Department of Finance, which on all matters of cost recovery advises other department and government agencies on what the appropriate interest charge should be. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not some sort of charge invoked maliciously or with an intent to defraud or to steeple the charges upwards as a penalty. It is a charge arrived at by the Department of Finance and advised to the Quarantine Service. It is the sort of advice that the Department of Finance gives any government agency or department on the appropriate interest rate according to movements in interest rate scales. </PARA>
<PARA> The quarantine farm at Torrens Island in South Australia holds sheep and goats imported for the purposes of breeding, I think their owners would say with pride, exotic fibres in Australia for commercial gain. That is quite a proper undertaking and I have only praise for their enterprise, certainly no criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> The animals that are brought in are animals which, on reasonable biological evidence and evidence relating to their health and with the possibility of being hosts for other diseases, run the risk of introducing into Australia scrapie-a disease which would devastate sheep and goat flocks in this country. If this country travels on the sheep's back, clearly, a quarantine service should prevent any diseases which would devastate the back upon which we travel. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I should perhaps continue with my remarks. In the case of Torrens Island, these animals are in quarantine for eight years because it takes eight years to breed out the possibility of scrapie. During that time considerable charges have been made because considerable costs have been incurred. Not all of the costs have been recovered. Something in excess of 50 per cent of the charges have been borne by the Commonwealth-that is, by ordinary taxpayers-so that this program can be fulfilled and the exotic fibres that these entrepreneurs wish to blend in Australia can gain entry into Australia without damage to the rest of our flock. So the Australian taxpayer has borne a significant part of these charges-50 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, if I take the implication of the reference to what interest rate is being charged to defaulters on payment, I would point out that no allegation can be made that the Commonwealth has behaved in an unreasonable way. In fact, the contrary allegation could be made by taxpayers who believe that we have been bending over backwards to accommodate this program and that we should not have gone as far as we have. As I have answered the questions put to me by various honourable senators on this program, I think that we should now get on with the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I contend that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has not answered the question that I addressed to him. In fact, the briefing received by the Minister on the matter is inadequate and totally uninformative. The answer that he gave could have been deduced from the speech which I made during the second reading debate in his absence. A seminar was held at which importers were advised that the price per animal would change from $50 to $75. The importers had little complaint about that in the final wash-up. What they did complain about was the change from $75 to $311. That was not mentioned in the Minister's answer, nor was the method by which that change was addressed. The change was advised by press release and subsequent notice to the importers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Brownhill has observed, there is little opportunity in this mechanism for the importers to approach an arbiter of any description, consult any other authority or have any redress over that alteration. If the Minister refers to my speech during the second reading debate, he will see mention of the fact that the case history takes the charges-by CPI increases and other means, whatever they are-now to be in excess of $400. In that process, as Senator Brownhill rightly observed, there is little or no opportunity for consultation, negotiation or arbitration of any description. That is the question-not $50 to $75, but $75 to $400-plus. When I referred to the expenses and asked what expenses we were talking about, that is what I meant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern is similar to that expressed by Senator Brownhill, but on a slightly different tack. From my understanding of the Minister's answer given a moment ago, the rate of charges will be advised to the importer at the time at which he enters into the agreement. Does that mean that the agreement will fix those rates of charges, or am I correct in taking it from what the Minister said that there may be a provision in the agreement for variance in the rate of charges?

My other observation is that an interest rate of 20 per cent is well above the costing of Commonwealth funding, which we all know to be around 10 per cent. That seems rather peculiar.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a monopoly. I would be surprised if anyone would argue that the control of quarantine should not be vested in a government authority and exercised under government regulation and control but that, in fact, it should be allocated to someone who might be the lowest bidder in a tender system. A regulatory authority is needed that does, in fact, do that-it regulates. That is what the Quarantine Service does. It regulates to prevent the importation into Australia of diseases that would have a deleterious impact on those of us-and the animals-who live here and vegetables that grow here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a place for regulatory authorities and they need to be monopolies to regulate. If they are not monopolies, they cannot regulate the field that they are given authority to regulate. That seems to me to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked whether there is an appeal. There is not an appeal because it is based on cost recovery. It relates to the costs incurred for the purposes of minding the plants or the animals in quarantine for the length of time that they are required to stay there. Those are recovered and that is reasonable. But to say that there is no appeal of any sort, which was the implication in the question, is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> In the particular case of these sheep and goats at Torrens Island in South Australia, the syndicates which own them have already taken action to the Commonwealth Ombudsman to complain about the Quarantine Service, the management of the island and the steepening of the charges. That is still with the Ombudsman and still undetermined. No doubt the Ombudsman will express an opinion about it and there may or may not be action flowing from that. Therefore, to pretend that ordinary citizens have no recourse against what might be implied by this question-an insensitive bureaucracy-is not true. There is that device, it is exercised in this case and we will get an answer in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, of course, in Senator Bell's question also a reference to how dramatically the charges have increased. It is true; they have increased dramatically. However, these sheep and goats get out of gaol on Torrens Island, I think, sometime next year. They and their progeny will have been there for eight years in order that we can be sure that diseases do not come in. In that time Government decisions on cost recovery-I stand here and take responsibility for it on behalf of the Government-have moved from 50 per cent through the range to now 100 per cent. That has been Government policy. It is not that the costs of the Service alone have increased; the percentage of costs recovered has increased by government decision. That explains why the charges have gone up so much. I will move now to the questions raised by Senator Brownhill. </PARA>

People will think that we come here to enjoy ourselves. Senator O'Chee asked a question, as did Senator Brownhill I think, as to whether contracts are entered into. No, they are not. The Quarantine and Inspection Service tries to provide an indication to importers of the charges for quarantining. Importers know what the detention time will be. They are then able to make a commercial judgment as to whether there is profit in their enterprise. But this is an indicative arrangement; it is not a contract system nor is it an agreement. It is an indication that if one wishes to access this service these will be the charges over that length of time. Therefore, the subsidiary questions that have been asked, probing what nature of agreement or contract there might be, are not relevant because there is none.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) summed up everything that he had been trying to say in the last half-hour in about three words when he said earlier that when people want to access quarantine-animals coming in must be quarantined; rightly so-they would be `told in advance' what costs they would be up for. Those were his words. That is the concept of the Opposition amendments. I believe, and the Minister did say, that there is no contract. But there must have been some sort of arrangement. An importer bringing in animals, or anything else, would be an utter fool to quarantine animals if he did not know what it would cost him when those animals were brought out of quarantine. That is the gist of our amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A communication I have states that importers of some goats were told by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that it would cost $50 per head for quarantine. That must not have been a very well run service because it is claimed also that the attendants fed whole wheat to some goats. Anyone with half a brain should know, especially if they are involved in agriculture, that whole wheat is a no-no; the goats died. The importers got some more goats and were told that it would cost $75 per head for quarantine. It is my understanding that that $75 per head did not increase on the basis of inflation but went up to $311 per head and that later the importers were told that the cost would be increased to nearly $400 per head. The purpose of our amendments is to prevent the charging of a higher than arranged figure for animals quarantined before 1 September-or the day on which the Bill is given royal assent. Our amendments will protect people who already have animals in quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious from the questions the Minister has been asked that there are a lot of loose arrangements. No-one seems to be able to be quite definite. However, there are importers who claim that the figures they were given started off at $50 and that they later agreed to a cost of $75, and that was the last agreement they made. If the Quarantine and Inspection Service is not able in the future to operate within reasonable costs the Government could look at privatising just the farming out side. I am not talking about the statutory requirements, but just the farming out of the animals for agistment. That could be quite easily worked out. It would be no different from putting an animal in the veterinary hospital. That side of things could be looked after quite easily. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this situation has got out of hand. I would like to commend the Australian Democrats for supporting the amendments. They have obviously had the same representations as we have and have seen that this is a gross case of retrospective legislation. I believe that if importers had been contracted to pay $50 per head and they later agreed to pay $75 per head plus an allowance for inflation, that is what the importers should be charged. I believe that when the new regulations come in on 1 September there will be more definite guidelines on exactly what an importer will pay to bring animals through quarantine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may be able to resolve this matter. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has indicated to me that if the amendments were in the following form, `The amendment of the principal Act effected by sections 3 and 4 does not apply to expenses incurred in respect of any animals, plants or goods first detained in quarantine before 1 September 1991', he would be prepared to accept them. It is my understanding in the interplay that has been joined between us behind the Chair that the omission from the amendments of the words, `embryos, gametes or other genetic material' is causing concern on the other side as to whether the form of words approved by the Minister is sufficiently broad enough to cover the range of interests that agitate concern in the Opposition and the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My advice is that the words included in the proposal from the Minister are sufficient-I should be quite precise-to cover the omitted words `embryos, gametes and other genetic material'. That is the advice we have. I know there has been some discussion that that does not appear to be quite clear from the Act. I reassert in Hansard that our advice is that they do cover those words that would be omitted. Moreover, if that advice is found to be in error at some point, the Government would be prepared to further legislate to correct the error. That is how confident we are that the words are covered properly. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I say on behalf of the Minister for Resources that if the words that I read before-and perhaps I should conclude by reading them again-were to replace the words in the amendment that Senator Tambling has put forward, we would accept them and the Bill could be thus amended and proceed accordingly. The words again are:</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment of the principal Act effected by sections 3 and 4 does not apply to expenses incurred in respect of any animals, plants or goods first detained in quarantine before 1 September 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>If those words could be accepted, we could dispense with this matter immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to the Committee that I do not accept the offer of the Minister in trying to reach this point. I have looked through the definitions of the principal Act in an attempt to see that our concerns were incorporated under any definitions of animals, plants or goods. I cannot find a sufficient definition in that area that would accommodate our concerns. The Minister has indicated that the Government would be prepared to come back with further amendments in the future. I find that is unnecessary, as by the inclusion of the words we seek-`embryos, gametes or other genetic material'-our concerns could be accommodated by this amendment now to save any amendment on any future occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 are a curious batch. The Opposition has no basic objection to the thrust of the legislation but, firstly, we do have a severe criticism of the manner in which the amendments have been presented to us and, secondly, we feel that other amendments should be made to the legislation and I will deal with that matter in some detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill seeks, in the main, to make changes to recreation leave entitlements and other matters that are exactly the same as the changes made in the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 which was passed and became an Act earlier this year. Quite frankly, it is simple incompetence that these changes were not included in that Bill. There can be no coherent explanation-at least, we have not heard one from the Government-for their exclusion from that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know the administrative cost of going over this area again and having to have additional legislation to do this for a group of bodies which happen to be in the arts, sport, the environment and tourism area-and now territories, as there is an additional amendment. I presume it would be at some cost; it is certainly at some inconvenience. I would be grateful if, in his summing up, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) could explain to us why these changes were not included in the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what internal hassles have gone on. I have been given some indications that there was some disaffection between various departments over the matter. But I would like to record the Opposition's objection to the fact that it would be a good idea if the Government could get its act-or in this context, its Acts-together so we do not have this sort of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to deal with the merits of the Bill and I certainly find nothing to complain about in the thrust of the changes in recreation leave entitlements to full time office holders. We will, of course, be supporting the thrust of the legislation with regard to that matter. However, there are many other things that we believe should be looked at in this legislation and I will be dealing with some of them in the committee stage. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From time to time comments are made in this chamber about insurance companies. One of my former colleagues, Ralph Jacobi, both in the chamber of the House of Representatives and outside the Parliament, was often critical of insurers. Ralph will not be the last to level this type of criticism against insurance companies. Indeed, I seem to recall a question in this area being asked only last week by my colleague Senator Crowley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Insurance companies were not initially established to allow ordinary householders to share risks amongst themselves. Trade and commerce led to the growth of the insurance industry so that the inevitable risks in those areas could, for a price, be shared. Later, individuals became involved with the purchase of life insurance and insurance over their personal possessions. Insurance companies provide a valuable service in our community. Without them, the normal risks of business would be compounded to such a degree that economic development would be stifled. Traders and those in the commercial field would not be prepared to expose themselves to what they consider to be unacceptable risks. </PARA>
<PARA> Insurance companies, of course, are not philanthropic institutions. The only way they can stay in business is at least to cover their costs. Because their shareholders have risked their funds, it is acceptable for insurance companies to make a profit; otherwise, their funds could be used in other, more profitable, enterprises. These companies, therefore, in their financial planning, must keep to the fore a number of competing interests. Their premiums must be sufficiently high to ensure, under normal trading, a profit which may be paid to shareholders; on the other hand, they must be sufficiently low to make the cost of insurance realistic for the customers; and, to attract and hold the public's custom, their premiums must be competitive when compared with those of other insurers. </PARA>
<PARA> Insurers must also guard against fraudulent claims. Some people think insurance companies are fair game and so inflate or invent their losses, but when the converse is true-namely, when a customer has a genuine claim-they think that an insurance company must make the necessary payment promptly. Under normal circumstances, it should not be expected that the premiums that insurance companies accept should be matched by what they pay to customers who suffer losses. After all, those of us who insure are sharing the risk amongst ourselves and are using a third party-an insurance company-to manage this aspect of our affairs. That third party needs to be recompensed. The most obvious source of funds to provide that financial backing is customers' premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> Not too long ago, insurance was a fairly simple process. I can remember that for years my father used to have his home insured against loss by fire only. These days there are all sorts of options; for example, damage by storm and tempest, malicious damage, breakage of glass, and fusion of electric motors. Similar complexities have occurred in relation to life insurance. With more decisions facing insurance companies' customers, the companies themselves have an additional responsibility: to make sure that their customers are paying for an appropriate product and that they clearly understand for what risks they are covered. </PARA>
<PARA> In this area I consider that some companies are not totally fulfilling their responsibility. Because of this, I would like to alert my constituents to one of the traps of taking out insurance. Where the warning applies, it should also be heeded by residents of States and Territories other than my own State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> A case which was brought to my attention relates to a burglary in a Brisbane suburb. The person concerned had taken out a contents insurance policy with a southern company which is making a major marketing move into Queensland. This company was chosen because its rates appeared quite competitive. In retrospect, it was a case of one gets what one pays for. The burglary was reported to the police, and a claim was made to the insurance company. Among the goods stolen were two computers, which were used as word processors, and a laser printer. </PARA>
<PARA> Theft of goods from one's own home is a traumatic event, but at least this person was consoled by the fact that he had shown sufficient presence of mind to have the contents insured. But his contents insurance was of little use. He was told that because he had not listed the computer equipment separately he would receive a total of $1,000 for the computers and the printer. This was at least $4,000 less than the value of the goods. Four thousand dollars may not seem a lot to some people. To a university student who is not receiving Austudy, but wants to have a certain amount of independence, it is a huge sum of money. The fact that the person thought he had done the right thing and insured his property made the limited pay-out of the insurance company even more unpalatable. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain English policy document which was forwarded to this person listed, amongst its exclusions and restrictions, a $1,000 limit on computer equipment unless previously notified to the company. However, it is a pity that the company had not mentioned this fact to its client before he paid for the policy. Because the provision about the computer equipment was in the written policy, the customer probably has no recourse. It is a sneaky way of conducting business. I subsequently examined the fine print of the contents insurance for my own home in Queensland. There was no mention of specifying computer equipment. There is well over $1,000 worth of computer equipment in my home protected, I might add, by a reliable burglar alarm system as well as security doors and windows. </PARA>
<PARA> The warning I give to my constituents is for them to read their insurance policy or policies with great care, and note whether there are any ways an insurance company could welsh on what would seem to be a reasonable claim. If this is the case, an immediate call to the insurance company is required, either to take out the required additional cover, or to notify the company that a more reasonable company has been located. I cannot stress this too greatly: read the policy with extreme care. If any doubt exists, seek some independent advice. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to name the particular company in the Senate because it may place it at a disadvantage in relation to other companies which have similar clauses in their policies. However, both my wife and I each have separate policies with this company and, when the time comes for renewal, we will be looking for a company which has a better customer record. When I am back in Queensland and the subject of insurance is raised, I shall have no hesitation in providing the name of the insurance company to which I have referred today. I will be candid about my opinion of its service to its customers. As far as I am concerned the company should stay south of the border and keep its sticky fingers off the money of Queenslanders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In common with my colleagues I have much to say about the content or, perhaps more precisely, the lack of content of what one would describe as the moribund ninth Hawke Budget. I will be addressing this matter in the context of the Budget debate at a later date. However, there are some vital factors of public interest in relation to the Budget which I think ought to be put on the record now. In some instances they have their origin in the March Economic Statement put down by former Treasurer Keating. For example, how does the Hawke Government continue to have the audacity to wage a scare campaign against a goods and services tax when it has, in this Budget, in effect, introduced such a tax on the sick? I refer to the $3.50 Medicare fee. The Government has also introduced a similar tax on service for migrants using our health care system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am in absolute agreement that Medicare needs much more to be done to it if it is ever to show any semblance of efficiency and to become cost-efficient and, to a certain extent, self-funding through the Medicare levy. But the Government should be more honest. The $3.50 up-front payment for a GP's visit, which increases to $5 in November next year, is simply a tax on a service; nothing more, nothing less-a tax on a service. Taking the user pays principle, it is, absolutely, a goods and services tax in that particular area-in this case, the sick. The Government cannot deny this, although I have no doubt that it will attempt to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal comes from the very team which has been attempting to bring tears to children's eyes with emotive comments about a coalition government goods and services tax making every visit to McDonald's a visit to the tax man. What this hypocritical and deceitful Government refuses to put on the table is that a goods and services tax from a coalition government comes as part of a tax package, with income tax cuts providing more money in the pocket to spend. The point conveniently overlooked by the Government is that it means tax on what one spends and not so much on what one earns. That is the objective behind our restructuring and, incidentally, was the objective behind the restructuring put forward by former Treasurer Keating. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), also advocated that line not so long ago. Those who had the opportunity to see the Sunday program could well foresee Senator Richardson's remarks coming back to haunt him. </PARA>
<PARA> A GST from a coalition government totally removes the tax by stealth of the present wholesale sales tax system and also tackles the black economy. Yet on Tuesday every Australian needing the services of a local doctor was hit by what is in effect a 15 per cent goods and services tax on that service. Taken as a proportion of the present Medicare schedule fee of $22.50, the $3.50 is a 15 per cent tax being levied by the Hawke Labor Government on a visit to the local GP. Labor's Budget delivered no more money into the pocket of the public from which to pay that added tax, unlike the coalition's proposed goods and services tax with its corresponding substantial reductions in income tax rates. As ever with the Hawke Government, it is taxation by stealth; it seems to be the only way it operates. Just look at how it has broadened the net of the wholesale sales tax system since the Tax Summit. Instead of $3.5 billion being collected by the indirect hidden wholesale sales tax system, we now have in excess of $11 billion being collected by this Administration. There is nothing up-front in the taxation sense with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> While I do not disagree with the principle of user pays, nor argue with the introduction of a non-returnable levy of, I think, $822 on all migrants to cover their initial usage of Australia's health system, I most definitely will not sit quietly by and let the Hawke Government pretend that the levy is not a goods and services tax. It is a goods and services tax with another title on it. The public and the media should not be fooled: a services tax is already in place in Australia courtesy of the Hawke Labor Government, but the Government will not admit to it. It makes the scare campaign by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) against the GST sound very hollow indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, a coalition government will be honest enough to tell the people of Australia exactly what they are being taxed on, up-front. There will be no hidden tax system such as the wholesale sales tax system, nothing hidden or behind the scenes-it will all be up-front, to openly display the tax on the goods people buy and on the services they use. Sadly, hidden taxes, like hidden political agendas, have become the norm over the past nine years of the Hawke Labor Government. Look at the deal that was done prior to the last Federal election campaign; it showed a preparedness not to be straightforward and honest with the people. </PARA>
<PARA> A Budget week example from South Australia says it all. It occurred to me as I flew to Canberra from Adelaide on Monday morning that the line `A funny thing happened on my way here tonight' used to be every comedian's favourite introduction, so I suppose I could have laughed at the joke as I opened my copy of the Adelaide News-if I thought it was at all amusing. Splashed all over page 2 was what one could only describe as a funny thing-self-confessed Hawke supporter, Senator Graham Maguire, promising more than $400m in wholesale sales tax cuts to be announced in John Kerin's Budget to be brought down the following day. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DU4">Senator OLSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year. What was the good senator up to, I thought to myself, with a headline like that? Perhaps he had had a leak from the top designed to show what a great bloke Prime Minister Hawke was, or perhaps he had ESP, or just the usual determination to fool all of the people all of the time. I did not have to wait for the Budget the following day for the answer to that. Every single change to the wholesale sales tax system announced by Senator Maguire in the news on Monday as about to happen in the next day's Budget had, I discovered, already been announced by Paul Keating in the March Economic Statement. Every one of the changes was five months old.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interestingly, Senator Maguire did not happen to mention in his press release the one wholesale sales tax change that was announced in the Budget, that relating to motor vehicles used for the transport of the disabled. He had left that out. There was no leak, no ESP. It was just another press release trying to get a headline without honesty and fact to back it up. I repeat that he talks about $400m being provided this year. According to the Budget Papers, one has to wait until 1993-94 before anything like $400m in wholesale sales tax cuts are actually delivered and returned for a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose Senator Maguire counts his antics in fooling a journalist relatively new to the political job, in a blatant bid to puff up the Prime Minister and con the public, as a success. I suppose he would count the headline as being a success. However, all it does is reinforce the desperate deceitfulness of a debilitated government, a government with nothing left in the medicine cupboard to prescribe for the wounds it has inflicted on the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly most economists presumed there would be, and should be, more simplifications and changes to the wholesale sales tax system announced in the Budget to give some relief to the business sector. It has been pounded by the Government's high real interest rate policy-I spoke about that last Thursday-and profits after tax are at their lowest level in 25 years. The business sector has now been slugged again by the Government's Budget superannuation proposals. Economists are still waiting, just as the business community is still waiting, for the changes announced in the March Economic Statement-and helpfully reannounced by Senator Maguire this week-to be introduced into Parliament so they can actually take effect. Relief is long overdue and has been a long time coming with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a promise from the Government that the March announcement of changes to the wholesale sales tax system on business inputs would be followed by legislation early in the Budget session. We wait with interest to see whether the promised timeframe is adhered to. Meanwhile, if Senator Maguire is really so keen to dispense good news Hawke-style, perhaps he could let the business community know immediately when to expect the long-awaited review legislation. I feel that at least he owes it that after Monday's press release-a blatant piece of nonsense-or are we simply asking too much of him? The simple fact is that the business community has been promised, for more than five months, a major restructuring of the wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>

Senator Ray is in this place, despite the fact that a majority of the two-party preferred vote in this country does not support the Government sitting on the government side of this House, nor did it in South Australia last time around. One can go to other States and get exactly the same example. So Senator Ray should not give me that nonsense about the Liberal Party not getting the endorsement of the South Australian population. We did, with 52.4 per cent, and we are not there because of the boundaries that have been drawn in South Australia. That is the reason we are not in government. It is like playing grand final footy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not defending that era, but Senator Ray should not stand up and defend his era when he is presiding over exactly the same set of circumstances. That is why there is currently a redistribution in South Australia. Following the last State election people were asked whether they endorsed the current boundaries and overwhelmingly they said they did not. They said that there needed to be change; that fairness and equity needed to be put back into the electoral system in South Australia. I ask Senator Ray not to chide me with any nonsense about not getting the support of the population of South Australia. I did. That support was at the ballot box and it was absolutely indisputable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we will be putting forward to the population of Australia a series of fundamental structural changes to the economy of this country, which it needs. There are no better examples to be had than getting out in the community and meeting small business people, recognising the constraints they are under, seeing the number that are going bankrupt and seeing the number that are having to dismiss long time employees simply because, at the end of the day, they cannot afford to pay them. The Budget that has just been brought down ignores that need. It does not address it in a meaningful way. I have highlighted in my comments today how in March we were promised relief in relation to business inputs. That relief has not come about, and what we have to do is wait until 1993-94 before we get anywhere near $400m worth of relief-that is, if the legislation is introduced and we actually get to debate it and if this week's headline concerning Senator Maguire has any reality or honesty to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this matters of public interest discussion to highlight a particular set of figures which do not get much publicity. We hear much about the current unemployment situation and the fact that the registered unemployment rate is close to 10 per cent. In my State of Western Australia it is 11 per cent. Often the Government compares the rate-Senator Button did so yesterday in Question Time-with that which existed when we were last in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I want to talk about bankruptcies and what is happening in that sector. My colleague Senator Olsen has referred to some of the impacts stemming from the lack of action by this Labor Government in terms of giving some relief to small business. Of course, one such impact is interest rates. It is interesting to compare the bankruptcy figures during the Fraser Government's term of office with the figures during the Hawke Government's eight years of office. During the Fraser years there were 30,945 bankruptcies, an average of 3,868 per year. During the Hawke-Keating-and now Kerin-years there were 60,089 bankruptcies, or an average of 7,511 per year. The figure has almost doubled. It has gone from 3,868 per year to 7,511 per year, on average. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go a little further and look at what has occurred this year as a result of Labor Government policies that have been foisted on the Australian public-the policies that have created the present disastrous unemployment rates-we find there was an overall increase in the number of bankruptcies in the period from 1989-90 to 1990-91. The figure went up from 8,552 bankruptcies to 12,991-an increase of 52 per cent. In my State, Western Australia, the number of bankruptcies rose from 1,088 to 1,849-a massive increase of 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales, the figure went from 2,230 to 3,396-an increase of 52 per cent. In Victoria, the figure of 1,809 had blown out to 3,098-an increase of 71 per cent. In Queensland, the 1989-90 figure of 1,591 had blown out to 2,424-an increase of 52 per cent. In South Australia, the number of bankruptcies in 1989-90 was 1,319 and in 1990-91 it was 1,655-an increase of 26 per cent. The only State that had any joy at all in terms of these figures was Tasmania which had a reduction from 440 to 211. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the other side of the equation, at the businesses which will provide the employment to overcome our unemployment problems, we find a massive 52 per cent increase in the number of bankruptcies in the last financial year. This is going to have a dramatic impact on the capacity of this country to re-employ those people who are unfortunate enough not to have a job. Without going into my reply to the Budget, I must say, as Senator Olsen did, that there is no relief in terms of the taxation system for small business, or anybody else for that matter. The changes to the wholesale sales tax, which will not come through until 1994, will do little to overcome this problem at a time when it needs to be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the estimates that have been put forward, in terms of what is anticipated this financial year, we see no light on the horizon and no sign that the figures are going to get better. In fact, the signs are that the situation will get worse. It is important that the Australian public be aware of the other side of the equation: not just the unemployment disaster but also the business bankruptcy disaster that is going on in our country at this time as a result of the Labor Government's failed economic and industrial policies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the context of the Budget having been brought down this year and the pain and suffering that are being inflicted upon the Australian public generally, I also want to analyse some of the arguments that are put forth in the public arena against the need for tax reform which we on this side of the House see as one of the most important aspects that this country needs to tackle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague who spoke before me, Senator Crane, dealt in a very across-the-board manner with the figures concerning the number of bankruptcies and how they are growing. He also outlined, for the record, just how bad the economy is in that regard. My colleague Senator Olsen pointed out how the imposition of the $3.50 medical fee, which is to be imposed for a visit to the doctor, in effect, amounts to a de facto consumption tax of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> When we start to look at those who would decry the need for tax reform, which would include a goods and services tax, it is worth while looking at the record of those who cry out the loudest. Today I have chosen to look at the criticisms that come forth from one Mr Eric Risstrom. Mr Risstrom writes a regular column and has long held himself to be an astute tax commentator. He likes to think he is known as the taxpayers' friend. But an appraisal of his record over the period ranging from the Tax Summit in 1985 to the present shows that one should, perhaps, look much more critically at the sorts of opinions that Mr Risstrom frequently puts pen to paper to express. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Risstrom's record is one of resisting genuine tax reform. Describing his attitude as being equivocal about the introduction of a broad-based goods and services tax would perhaps be correct. He was reported in the Australian of 15 February 1985 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government should only introduce an expanded sales tax-which at present takes effect at the wholesale end-if it were determined to broaden indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, on the opening day of the Tax Summit Mr Risstrom opposed the consumption tax proposal but said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the retail tax in the economy is something that I believe should be studied. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to mention the IBIS study, which, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . suggests that it would be dangerous to introduce a retail tax for at least four years and maybe seven years. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that in 1985. Six years have gone by, so one could reasonably say that any danger that he might have seen then would have passed. Why does he still resist reform?</PARA>
<PARA>Almost a year ago to this week Mr Risstrom wrote in the Sun-Herald:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the worst time to introduce such a tax on spending is when inflation is high-and there is no evidence it will come down for years. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Risstrom could not have been more mistaken. Today inflation stands at 3.4 per cent, the lowest in 20 years, and the Budget Papers put out this week predict a 3 per cent inflation rate for the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go on to look at the way Mr Risstrom has handled his arithmetic, I think it is reasonable to look at the 1985 Tax Summit, when Treasury revealed that a $1.1 billion error was present in Mr Risstrom's calculations regarding the cost of abolishing the wholesale sales tax. Also, he likes to exaggerate figures. This was demonstrated by his estimate, again at the Tax Summit, that the administration of a consumption tax as cited at that time would be greater by some 600 per cent than the Treasury said it would be. </PARA>
<PARA> Another tactic that Mr Risstrom likes to use is to pluck figures out of the air. In his article in the Sun-Herald of 21 July 1991 he claimed that people spend 75 per cent of their income on things that are currently not taxed. There is, of course, no publicly available data to support this proposition. To the contrary, the Coopers and Lybrand report shows that in a large retail store, such as a supermarket, at least 50 per cent of all goods are subject to wholesale sales tax. Even those goods which purport to be exempt from the sales tax are very often subject to a tax component. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look again at the comments Mr Risstrom has made concerning tax evasion. One of the arguments used for the need for tax reform is that, if a goods and services tax were introduced to replace the wholesale sales tax and at the same time the rate of income tax were cut and a compensation package were introduced, whole sections of the black economy or the cash economy which presently do not participate in the tax system would be brought into the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Risstrom said in the Australian Financial Review of 1 June 1989 that it is often said that if we switched to a consumption tax it would multiply tax avoidance by four. I do not know where he got the numbers or the concept from, but a similar claim was made by him in the Age of 15 July 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . nobody knows how big the cash economy is but don't believe the argument that a GST would fix it. Evidence from overseas countries is that overall it would be far worse. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody is saying that it is a panacea, but what we are saying is that the evidence does not back up Mr Risstrom's statements. After all, in New Zealand, after the introduction of the goods and services tax the Government recouped an estimated 5 per cent of GDP from its newly taxed cash economy. Putting that another way, it simply meant that the number of people who chose to register their businesses-that is, as businesses with a certain turnover-was way beyond the expectation or the knowledge that they had from businesses that were already paying tax; that is, businesses that had not been paying tax beforehand began to pay tax because they saw the reform as being beneficial. In Australia, the Victorian employers' Chamber of Commerce estimated that a GST would collect at least $500m from the cash economy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to return to that tax summit, because it is quite revealing about how some people develop their ideas. Three days into the tax summit Mr Risstrom said, `I felt throughout the community no great opposition to an extension of indirect taxes in some areas of services'. Without any explanation whatsoever Mr Risstrom has now reversed his position on the question of taxing services. Instead of applauding the proposal, he now likes to be a scaremonger on the proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Taxpayer, the journal of the Australian Taxpayers Association, of 16 June 1990, Mr Risstrom wrote in the most emotive terms. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>But just what services would be taxed? Answer: Expenditure on situations such as</PARA>
<PARA> - funerals</PARA>
<PARA> - accountancy fees</PARA>
<PARA> - the cost of joining the local club</PARA>
<PARA> - and the list is endless. </PARA>
<PARA>In a way it is evidence of his lack of intellectual honesty that having first supported the proposition of the legitimacy of taxing services and accepting that a consumption tax-be it a goods and services tax or some other that he then encountered-was worthy of support, he now says that somehow it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> His present contention is that we ought somehow to leave the wholesale sales tax in place. I remind honourable senators that the tax is both inequitable and illogical, ranging as it does from a 10 to 30 per cent tax; a tax on chocolate biscuits but not on caviar; on orange juice but not on pornographic literature; people who can afford to go by aeroplane to their holiday destination get that tax free, but people who buy a caravan to minimise the cost of their annual holiday have to pay a tax on the caravan. That shows that already there is not only a lack of logic in the way that the tax is imposed, but also a total lack of equity. </PARA>
<PARA> To accept Mr Risstrom's proposition that somehow the wholesale sales tax system should be broadened and allowed to become the de facto, valid, indirect method of taxation alone would, in fact, make it a broad-based consumption tax. On 4 July 1985, again at that tax summit, he said, `The wholesale sales tax has been deprecated in many ways, but I believe in many ways it is intrinsically a good system'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to tell Mr Risstrom that there are thousands upon thousands of Australians, both eminent and ordinary, vocal and silent, who find that it is not a sensible tax; it is neither logical nor equitable. Those people wish to see-and indeed demand-tax reform. They demand that their politicians' intentions be open and honest. That is exactly what the Opposition is doing. We are presenting our tax reform package in such a way that people can really understand the need for and the sense of it, and our true intent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters says that it will, and that is what she would like to believe. The Opposition has an economic model prepared on the basis of producing certain figures on the assumption that wages as identified in the Budget Papers, that is, wage outcomes of 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent, would be additional to, or would be added to, superannuation. That is not the case. Indeed, in September there will be a conference between the Government, unions and employer organisations to discuss all of these questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no good coming in here and arguing on the basis of quite false assumptions, which are not there, which are not part of the Budget and which are not part of the process which the Government envisages. I illustrate that point further by saying that both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have said that superannuation will be taken into account in future award negotiations and that award negotiations will be taken into account similarly in relation to the superannuation entitlements which employees are given under the announced program. As I have indicated, the figures set out in the Budget are indicative. One has only to read the Budget Papers to understand that.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to set the environment for what I am saying by simply making the point that throughout the years of this Government there has been significant wage restraint and reduction in real wages. The fact of the matter is that that has been agreed to as a policy which is beneficial to the Labor movement and the work force generally. The same comments can be made about superannuation. The Government is interested in locking in low inflation, creating jobs and stimulating investment. That is an agenda which is shared, for example, by the ACTU. It is a Labor agenda.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="923" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the Senate will share my relief and delight at the news we all woke up to this morning. It really was a triumph for the democratic instinct. It gives us all, I think, very great confidence both for the future of the peoples of the Soviet Union and, indeed, for the future peace and stability of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that the coup has comprehensively failed. As to the key participants in it, I understand that Defence Minister Yazov is now in the Crimea; KGB Chief Kryuchkov is under arrest by the Interior Ministry of the Russian Federation; and Yanayev, who led the State of Emergency Committee, was at last report still in his Kremlin office but, presumably, he will not be there for very much longer. Most of the rest of the Committee are reported to have fled Moscow for the central Asian republic of Kirghizia. All troops have left Moscow and the curfew has been lifted. President Gorbachev, who is in fact in very good health, is back in Moscow this morning, is back in control, and is shortly to make a major speech.</PARA>
<PARA> There are, clearly, a number of reasons why the coup failed. One of them was the crucial role played personally by Boris Yeltsin. Secondly, there was the bravery and determination of the peoples of Moscow, Leningrad, the Baltic states and elsewhere not to be cowed by brute force. Thirdly, there was the international reaction, in which Australia joined and which was so comprehensive and so intense that, clearly, it did do something to weaken the Committee's resolve. Fourthly, I think one has also to ascribe it to very poor planning and organisation by the coup leaders, who seemed to think that all they had to do was embark upon some re-run of the coups of the Krushchev era and before involving backroom deals, the gagging of the media and a reliance on the shut up or be shot system prevailing so far as the community as a whole is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the outcome represents a very significant victory for both President Gorbachev and President Yeltsin. With the conservatives now comprehensively discredited, the progressive forces that Gorbachev and Yeltsin represent should be able to move the reform process forward with renewed vigour. A precondition for that will remain the effective cooperation between those two leaders as well as the acceptance of a durable legal and political arrangement defining future relations between the centre and the republic. That will, of course, be necessary for those republics, particularly the Baltics, that have made very clear their wish to opt for full independence.</PARA>
<PARA> In the rather euphoric atmosphere that is prevailing post-coup, we must not forget the very real problems that the Soviet Union continues to face, particularly in the economic sphere. The Australian Government will support concerted international action to provide a framework for economic development to the Soviet Union. In that respect I am pleased to be able to indicate that the freeze measures that were taken by this Government have now been lifted, including the restriction on the trade credit facility.</PARA>
<PARA> We look forward to further development and consolidation of the bilateral relationship between Australia and the Soviet Union. We also look forward with very considerable relief to the Soviet Union, without any ambiguity, continuing the very constructive policies that were pursued by President Gorbachev. Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh, who is now back in action, has told a press conference that with the collapse of the coup the Soviet Union is coming back to the road of commonsense policies, and that Soviet foreign policy remains unchanged. We can now reasonably expect a continuation of solid Soviet cooperation on a range of international issues, including those of the Middle East and Cambodia, and we also anticipate the Soviet Union maintaining its largely more constructive policies to the Asia-Pacific region generally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Industrial Relations been drawn to complaints by various spokespersons for industry and business groups that employers cannot afford universal superannuation cover for people in the workplace? Has he any information about the superannuation entitlement in the remuneration packages paid by the employers of those people, as distinct from the workers they are complaining about? Further, is there any great difference between the superannuation cover typically paid in the private sector, on the one hand, to executives and professionals and, on the other hand, to workers who are further down the pecking order?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="925" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the complaints that have been made by people representing various organisations about the inability, in their assertion, of the members of those organisations to pay superannuation entitlements. For example, I am aware that the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Small Business Association and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures are among organisations whose spokespersons have made that allegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat, as I said yesterday, that legislation to enshrine superannuation as a major social change in this country would not bring any cost until 1 July next year, which means that the recovery can proceed this financial year without that cost being imposed. As honourable senators will know, under the award system most employers in this country are bound in any case to pay a 3 per cent superannuation levy. Many are bound by agreements in which they have voluntarily offered to pay more, and under that formulation most small business, which would be paying superannuation at the rate of 3 per cent now, will not face an extra charge on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA> I am asked in this question whether I know of the remuneration package that these spokespersons have obtained from their own organisations. I do not know. The spokespersons for these organisations are certainly senior executives, and traditionally in the packages for senior executives there is a provision for superannuation entitlement. So it is fairly safe to assume that all of the people who are complaining about the spread of superannuation are safe in the knowledge that they have the entitlement for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics more than 80 per cent of specialist managers in this country obtain superannuation and more than 70 per cent of business professionals do so. By contrast, only 30 per cent of female receptionists obtain the advantage of superannuation; 23.2 per cent of farm labourers have a superannuation entitlement; and female shop assistants check in last, with only 17 per cent having a superannuation entitlement. There is, if you like, a double standard in the sense that those who rest in the security of having superannuation are complaining that those who hold low wage positions and are not obtaining superannuation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All substantial proposals under the development import finance facility, or DIFF, scheme are subject to feasibility studies and appraisal by AIDAB officers. In addition, there is an annual program of project evaluations to assess whether the projects have met their objectives. In regard to the impact on recipient countries, all DIFF proposals are assessed against a number of quite specific developmental criteria. These include the project's contribution to the recipient's economic and social development, its priority in the recipient's development plan and, of course, the project's economic and financial viability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The benefit to Australian companies is primarily that it allows them to compete equally against aid supported financial packages which are offered by other donor countries. Clearly, it does, therefore, allow firms from Australia to participate in more overseas projects. The benefit of the scheme to Australian firms is currently being surveyed by AIDAB. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the scheme has allowed firms to demonstrate their capabilities and has led to further export sales. The difficulty is to quantify that in the still relatively early life of the program as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last part of the question, the DIFF scheme is a very important part not of the general foreign affairs budget but of the aid program and is appropriately, in our judgment, funded from the aid budget. Many parts of the aid program provide trade spin-offs of one kind or another. That is as it should be. Provided that the basic rationale of any money that we spend under the aid program is developmental-and that is the case here-there is no need to apologise for Australian business getting some benefit from such a program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. I refer the Minister to an incident on 3 August in which debris estimated to weigh approximately 44 kilograms fell from a Thai International aircraft onto suburbs north of the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, including Marrickville, Stanmore and Annandale. I ask the Minister whether it is true that the draft environmental impact statement for the proposed third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport failed to recognise, let alone evaluate, a life threatening risk of this nature.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing to say in response to Senator Faulkner's question is that the EIS canvasses the question of risk at the airport. The second thing to say is that calculating the odds on this incident happening would be almost impossible because the number of incidents is so small. The aircraft concerned, which was from Thai Airways, an airline with a very sound safety reputation, lost a portion of the exhaust system-the exhaust cone-from the rear of one of its engines. The aircraft continued its flight and landed safely in Bangkok.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pieces of the engine were recovered and given to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. They are currently being subjected to detailed metallurgical testing in order to determine how and why the failure occurred. The results of this examination are not yet known, but the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has advised me that this failure is so rare that it is only aware of one other similar incident on any aircraft anywhere in the world. The Civil Aviation Authority is providing laboratory facilities and expertise for the investigation, and a senior engineering specialist from the engine manufacturer, General Electric, is in Australia to assist the investigation that is being carried out at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say categorically-not just in response to Senator Faulkner's assertions but also to some recent public statements by another enthusiast in the House of Representatives-that the problem at Sydney Airport is not a question of congestion of the air space; it is a question of congestion of the runway space.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that many honourable senators have taken an interest in the problem of cervical cancer in the community, which is the sixth most common cause of cancer in women. What has been noted before in this chamber is that it is eminently preventable. A screening is able to detect precancerous abnormalities of the cervix. However, despite significant financial support from the Government, the current system of cervical cancer screening in Australia is not well organised. Older women, who have the highest incidence of cervical cancer, Aboriginal women and women who are isolated are poorly screened, while many younger women are screened more often than is necessary. It is anticipated that the adoption of an organised approach to screening can reduce by half the number of cervical cancer cases detected in Australia every year.</PARA></TALK.START>

Also until recently there has been no agreement on the vital issue of the age at which screening should commence and the interval between screenings. The new policy, which has been widely endorsed by professional groups and cancer societies, recommends that all women between the ages of 18 years and 70 years be screened every two years.</PARA>
<PARA> The $22.4m for cervical cancer screening announced in the Budget will improve the effectiveness of screening by redirecting the emphasis of our screening effort to at risk women. The funds will be used to develop and implement a communication strategy targeted initially at service providers, followed by information aimed at women. The funds will also be used to improve the reliability of Pap smear taking and guidelines for treatment of abnormalities.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edith Weisberg, the Medical Director of the Family Planning Association of New South Wales, has been appointed the Commonwealth spokesperson on cervical cancer. There will also be the development of strategies to encourage the improved participation of at risk women and also to improve the effectiveness of training, monitoring and evaluation. The benefit of an organised approach to screening will be a 50 per cent reduction in the number of cases; that is, a reduction of 1,040 of cervical cancer cases diagnosed annually.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sign of the times that, when Aboriginal affairs is not the scandal of the month that it used to be, people forget who handles the matter in here. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided me with the following advice: an application under section 9 of the Act was made by the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia on behalf of the Ngalia Heritage Research Council on 28 May 1991. This application sought protection of several sites at the proposed mine. In accordance with the requirements of section 13(2) of the Act, the Minister wrote to his Western Australian counterpart, the Hon. Dr Judyth Watson, to seek advice as to what action, if any, the State Government proposed to take to protect these sites, given the apparent threat of injury or desecration presented by mining activities. The Minister subsequently met with Dr Watson and discussed the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of background, two anthropological reports on the Yakabindie area were compiled, the first one clearing the area for mining and the later one providing evidence that the sites will be destroyed by mining operations. On the basis of the first report, the State had previously approved the mine project. Dr Watson referred both reports to the Aboriginal Cultural Material Committee for assessment, an expert body set up under the State's Aboriginal State Heritage Act 1972. This Committee proposed that an independent anthropological expert from the South Australian museum should be commissioned to examine all of the evidence in relation to Aboriginal sites at Yakabindie and the credentials of all persons who have provided information to the previous studies.</PARA>
<PARA> Dominion Mining Ltd agreed that it would not proceed with site works until the matter was resolved. At a recent meeting at Leonora, Aboriginal people attending supported the mining project and saw no need for further studies. The State has now decided that the further studies should not be undertaken and the Premier has written to the Prime Minister requesting that the Commonwealth decline the application before it. The State's request is under consideration. The Minister is conscious of the importance of resolving the matter as soon as possible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regrettably, there has been a rapidly increasing incidence of dangerous goods being carried on aircraft. That is of great concern to the aviation industry and to the Government. As a result of that, this morning in Melbourne I launched a public awareness campaign on the carriage of dangerous goods on aircraft. The aviation industry and the CAA are becoming increasingly concerned that a growing number of passengers are not aware of, or are ignoring, the laws relating to carriage of dangerous goods on aircraft. I am sure that all honourable senators, being frequent fliers as we are, would share this concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Every day, passengers are detected carrying or attempting to carry prohibited goods onto aircraft in their hand luggage or in their baggage; some passengers are even found carrying these goods in their pockets onto aircraft. In most cases, the incidents have been found to be as a result of ignorance; the people involved simply did not realise that many common items such as books of matches, cigarette lighter fluids and aerosols have the potential to cause a major aircraft disaster.</PARA>
<PARA> Until recent times, I had to include myself in that category. Having seen a fire at Adelaide Airport in the hold of an Australian Airlines Boeing 727 that I was travelling on caused by carrying a book of matches in a suitcase, I want to particularly highlight the real problems of carrying books of matches in hold baggage. A Darwin woman by the name of Mrs O'Brien was in fact brought to the launch this morning-I happen to know her particularly well; I did not realise that she would be there-to talk personally of an incident where her luggage had spontaneously combusted, fortunately before it got onto the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> A fairly spectacular demonstration was staged this morning in Melbourne by the CAA safety personnel showing what can happen if two normally harmless substances-and the three demonstrated were all household goods found in every home-are mixed together. The results were very spectacular indeed. This is a serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA> Ignorance in this case is not bliss and the legal requirement on the carriage of dangerous goods in aircraft exists to protect the airlines and their passengers from these incidents. The CAA will prosecute serious offences, with offenders facing substantial fines or gaol sentences. But legislation alone will not solve the problem, which is why the public awareness campaign that has been launched this week is crucial to ensure that the current situation, whereby Australia has never had an aviation accident caused by dangerous goods, is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I also draw the attention of honourable senators to a related issue-the role of the Civil Aviation Authority in combating a major chemical fire which started in Melbourne yesterday. All of us would pay tribute to the work of all firefighting services in controlling this major fire in what were clearly very dangerous circumstances for the firefighters.</PARA>
<PARA> I particularly congratulate the Civil Aviation Authority rescue and firefighting services from the Melbourne Airport for their contribution. Fortunately, the CAA was holding a major training program for its fire services this week and a number of units-I think nine altogether-and personnel were able to be moved directly from these exercises to attend the chemical fire. The Civil Aviation Authority units from Melbourne Airport acted in response to requests from the Metropolitan fire brigade and are continuing to play a significant role in combating the fire which I understand is still being attended by both fire units and personnel.</PARA>

Given the recent acquittal of four IRA terrorists charged with the murder of Australians Nick Spanos and Stephen Melrose in Holland, and the fact that some 12 Australians in the last three years have been the victims of political unrest overseas, what representations have been made to the Attorney-General to give Australian courts the power to try foreign terrorists for crimes committed against Australians overseas? What consideration has the Government given to this very important matter, which would bring our law into line with that of many other Western countries?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that Senator O'Chee has made representations to the Attorney-General as to whether it might be possible for Australian courts to exercise jurisdiction over those who carry out terrorist acts against Australians overseas. Representations have also been made by Professor Wilkinson of the University of St Andrews, and some other world authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the Government is giving consideration to those representations, some matters need to be kept in mind. One is the sheer difficulty of the court exercising its jurisdiction in a way which is familiar to us. In other words, how does an Australian court examine the evidence in relation to an incident which occurred overseas? How do we get witnesses back to Australia, or take evidence overseas in relation to events which are the subject of the allegation and prosecution? I would have thought that the many days spent by this chamber in relation to similar problems when we considered the war crimes legislation would indicate the grave difficulty of ensuring the fair trial of those who are accused of committing an offence overseas-the question of getting evidence before the jury.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the particular case that Senator O'Chee mentioned of the murder of Spanos and Melrose overseas, I would not want to agree with any inference I am asked to draw about the correctness of the acquittal verdict reached by the Dutch judges in that instance.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as extradition of such accused persons from overseas jurisdictions to Australia is concerned, I think there would be some difficulty in ensuring that all countries would agree to such extradition. The real value of having such a proposal accepted would be in putting pressure on those overseas countries either to prosecute or to extradite, and there is some merit in that. Therefore, Australia is a party to several international conventions which do provide, in limited circumstances, for precisely that sort of regime.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, where there are particular aspects of terrorism, if the overseas country does not prosecute, then Australia-if a party to a particular convention-can ask for the person who is accused to be extradited for trial in Australia. These conventions include the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages; the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons, including diplomatic agents; and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation which my colleague Senator Collins would, of course, be very familiar with.</PARA>
<PARA> In those limited circumstances-for example, if an act of terrorism occurred on a Qantas flight or on a flight to or from Australia-the sorts of procedures which Senator O'Chee mentions could be undertaken in accordance with those conventions. As to the wider question, the Attorney-General will give consideration to the honourable senator's representations.</PARA>

Quite clearly, if the various countries through which the terrorist had passed are parties to a convention-and certainly if the country in which the person has been arrested or is located is a party-I do not see any difficulty in extraditing that person if the crime alleged falls within the terms of the convention.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government has been encouraged, as Senator Teague obviously has from his travels, with the political and economic developments which have taken place in many Latin American countries over the past five years or so. Unrepresentative governments and protectionist economic policies have given way to popularly elected civilian leaders committed to improving human rights and to introducing economic reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I saw for myself some of the quite remarkable progress that has been made, particularly in this respect in Mexico, when I visited there in October last year. I know that Dr Blewett was similarly impressed by the developments that he saw during his visits to Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been developing appropriate trade strategies to take advantage of the manifest economic opportunities that are opening up for us in these countries, in particular in Mexico and Chile. We have been actively encouraging Australian companies to seize the business opportunities now available in that region.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Blewett is a member of the ministerial trade strategy group which has commissioned policy papers on the appropriate trade strategy for developing markets with high potential in which we have certainly included Mexico and Chile. It will be recalled that a Mexican trade delegation accompanied President Salinas when he visited Australia in June last year. Dr Blewett led a reciprocal Australian delegation to Mexico in May. There is another one going to Chile in October.</PARA>
<PARA> We have assisted major Australian companies in Latin America, including BHP in Chile, AWA in Venezuela and various coal companies in Mexico. The Australian Government consults regularly with peak business organisations such as the CAI and the Australian-South American Business Council. Our embassies have also been supportive of the local chambers of commerce which have been established in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is sympathetic to the aspirations of a number of the Pacific-focused Latin American countries to join APEC. In principle we favour appropriate expansion of APEC. We are giving priority, as is the rest of the membership of APEC, at the moment to the three Chinese economies. But Mexico would seem to have a reasonably strong claim, particularly in the context of its negotiation with its own free trade agreement with Canada and the United States. How far and how fast that can be advanced will depend on consultation with our APEC colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA> The concept of a bilateral free trade agreement between Australia and Mexico raises extraordinary complex questions on who turns out to be the beneficiary. It has a lot to do with the range of products that can be incorporated in the agreement and the general negotiating environment. It is something that we are not adverse to having a look at, as has been the case in the context of Australia-US arguments for such an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it would be premature to leap quite as rapturously into that particular pond as Senator Teague is presently suggesting. However, it is not something that we rule out. It is just that in the present trade context we are giving, overwhelmingly, our priority to the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round rather than looking for an extension of bilateral solutions to trade liberalisation problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, Senator Newman has not done her homework. She has rushed into print and given a completely misleading impression of the funds available to the Australian War Memorial. The explanation for the reduction of $1m in the moneys available to the War Memorial is very simple. In 1989, the Government announced that it would provide $5m for the construction of the first stage of a new technology pavilion at the memorial-$3m of this was included in last year's Appropriations; $2m in this year's. For Senator Newman's benefit, that accounts for $1m of the difference and can hardly be incorporated in any comparative figuring of the memorial's budget. There has also been a small reduction in running costs. This simply reflects the efficiency dividend required of all Budget funded departments and agencies and other non-recurring expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been no turning away from our obligation as a national government for the proper functioning of the Australian War Memorial dedicated to the memory of those who have fallen in the various wars and battles in which Australians have been asked to engage. I believe it is a very simple explanation. Indeed, I believe that the technology pavilion at the memorial will be a very significant addition to the various displays which give so much pleasure to so many people who visit that memorial here in Canberra.</PARA>

As to the former part of the question, we have expressed a concern-I have done it myself on occasions in the past-when reports have become current of allegations of this kind being made. There is an acknowledgment within the ANC hierarchy that there have been, on occasion, excesses perpetrated against those formerly within their own ranks whom they have regarded as having been guilty of treachery or disloyalty or things of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are seeing with these latest allegations may or may not prove well-founded. But they should be regarded as part of the unfortunate trail of debris which the apartheid system has left. Liberation organisations of the kind that the ANC has been do not always behave as one would ideally like in pursuing a struggle of the kind that has been waged. That is the case with every liberation organisation that I can recall in history, not least, for example, in the context of the creation of modern Israel and some of the people who are now running the Government there.</PARA>
<PARA> There are excesses of a variety of kinds perpetrated in the course of such struggles. The important thing for us to appreciate is that that now is, hopefully, history and that what we can reasonably look forward to is an environment in the future where excesses that have been committed in the past, not only by one side but overwhelmingly in fact by the other in this situation-the behaviour of the South African Government security forces I would hope does not need to be brought again to Senator Kemp's attention-can be regarded as part of history and that we can look forward to a future in South Africa where nothing like this will ever happen again.</PARA>

They are in the context of training, of education, and the humanitarian support for returning exiles; they are matters of that kind.

Those figures are there in chart No. 7 and chart No. 4 in the Budget Papers-in colour, for those opposite who have difficulty with graphs. Those figures go back to 1954, if honourable senators want to make comparisons. What was suggested yesterday by Senator Vanstone and by way of a number of interjections was that somehow there had been some sort of structural decline in, or long term debilitation of, investment under this Government. That condition is well known to the Opposition, but it is not recorded in these figures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I have moved that the Senate take note of what really amounted to a statement rather than an answer to a question. It seems to me that the Minister is inviting debate on this issue. Whereas I do not want to delay the Senate for long, I think it is fair to put the other side of the argument, as we have heard only one side of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister bases his assessment, as I understand it, on the 1984-85 prices, which he indexes. What he fails to advise the Senate is that that particular price basis has been criticised by a number of economists for a number of different reasons. It has been criticised because of the uniquely high price of computers that prevailed at that time, and it is also being criticised because it fails to take into account changes in the quality and productiveness of new investment. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister had put that on the table he might have made a contribution towards a fairer debate. The facts, it seems, are that if one looks at it in current prices, which a number of economists say is the best way to make a fair assessment and a fair comparison, private new capital expenditure as a percentage of GDP in current prices under the Hawke Government has never exceeded the last two Fraser years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button can make another contribution to the debate if he wishes. New capital expenditure in the tradeable sector has, as Senator Vanstone said, been falling as a percentage of GDP since 1986-87. But there are other ways in which the Minister ought to be looking at the poor record of his Government in this regard. One way is to compare its contribution with that of other OECD countries. In fact, he will find that we are near the bottom of the list. Even Senator Button would concede that it is important for Australia to be a competitive nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to one respected commentator who has been collating these figures and writing on this subject for some years and who I believe Senator Button would regard as a respected commentator. I refer to Tim Colebatch, who writes for the Age. He said in an article earlier this year when assessing OECD figures:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the three years from 1988 to 1990, Australian investment in plant, equipment and machinery averaged 8.8 per cent of output, if measured in constant prices. The only countries to invest less were Canada (8.1 per cent) and France (8.6 per cent). </PARA>
<PARA>So another important aspect of this debate is that we are near the bottom of the list of OECD countries in investment. That is without the new figures that we introduced into the Senate debate last week, which the Minister seems to be disregarding. I shall conclude with Colebatch's view. On the error that the Minister is making in basing his figures on 1984-85 as indexed as opposed to using current figures, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The essential difference between the two is that investment at current prices measures the share of resources being devoted to new investment; for plant and equipment, as reported yesterday-</PARA>
<PARA>this article was written in March 1990-</PARA>
<PARA>that is now 7.4 per cent GDP, the lowest since 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister wants to debate the issue we will do so, but he should be fair and put both sides of the argument. Business knows the cost and the Minister knows that the investment that is being made is insufficient. He knows that it affects the competitiveness of this country, and the record is simply not good enough. </PARA>

When we talk about investment and the number of bankruptcies, since the Hawke Government has been in power there has been a total of 60,089 bankruptcies or an average of 7,511 per year in that time. However, if we look at the previous eight years of the Fraser Government, we see that there were 30,945 bankruptcies, which is an average of 3,868 per year. The figures have doubled in the Hawke period of government.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Button is leaving the chamber because he does not like hearing the figures and the truth about what has occurred; he cannot handle it. As the Minister leaves the chamber, I will mention the figures for his own State of Victoria. In 1989-90 in Victoria, there were 1,809 bankruptcies increasing to 3,098 in 1990-91-an increase of 71 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like also to contribute a little to this matter. I think it is time that the Government and public recognised the impact of this Government's policies on fixed capital investment. I am glad that the appalling response of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) to a question has given us the opportunity of dealing with the matter. I draw the Minister's attention to page 54 of the recently issued Australian National Accounts which shows that from the March 1989 peak quarter expenditure on new plant and equipment by the private sector in constant dollar terms-in 1984-85 prices seasonally adjusted-has now fallen by something like 29 per cent. It has fallen from $6,070m to $4,322m in the latest quarter. That is a 29 per cent collapse in gross fixed capital expenditure by the private sector on new plant and equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Government has to have this drawn to its attention over and over again. It does not yet seem to understand what it has done to destroy this economy. We have people such as Senator Button, the Minister in charge of this disaster, allegedly the Minister for Industry, coming into this chamber and pretending that everything is wonderful; that it is all on track and what a magnificent record we have. The figures clearly show that Senator Button himself has presided over a total disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of competence of the Minister is further underlined by the fact that yesterday we asked him-we have asked him repeatedly specific questions about elements of the collapse, the disaster-how many people would be on unemployment benefit and neither the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) nor Senator Button knew. We asked today what the number of youth unemployed would be as a result of this disaster. After all, the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) admitted yesterday that there would be 900,000 total unemployed. But what are the forecasts for youth unemployment here? The Minister did not know. He did not know again today what the reality of the collapse of private sector capital expenditure was on new plant and equipment. He tried to fudge the issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too share the concerns of my coalition colleagues about the collapse in private sector investment in this country. I think this is just part of the dilemma that Australia suffers at the moment because, of course, the collapse of private sector investment, especially in the areas of tradeable goods, has been matched by a failure of this Government to be able to fund new investment within the public sector. Of course, that is the real reason why our socialist friends on the other side of the chamber choose to privatise Qantas, choose to privatise Telecom and have been forced to privatise the Commonwealth Bank. The Government of this country no longer has sufficient resources to enable it to invest in the functions which it operates itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the collapse of investment in both the private and public sectors which is a hallmark of the collapse of this nation's economy. As my colleague and friend Senator Michael Baume has so ably said, we on this side are dreadfully concerned that this collapse of investment will lead inevitably to more and more unemployment. Already, we see youth unemployment rates, as a result in part of the collapse in investment, exceeding 28 per cent-that is, 28 per cent of young Australians cannot get a job. As a young Australian myself, I am very concerned at what this Government is doing to the future of a whole generation of young Australians. It has spread despondency and desperation amongst the people who will be the future backbone of this country. </PARA>

As anybody who reads this document knows, and anybody who was outside Russell Hill on the day concerned would know, it was Defence personnel who were handed that document.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a summary record of proceedings of the twentieth meeting of the Sport and Recreation Ministers Council held on 17 August 1990. I suppose that we could congratulate all the Ministers involved, particularly the Commonwealth Minister, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), for having taken only one year to produce this slender document. The time delays involved in reporting to this Parliament are getting ludicrous. I want to protest as strongly as possible to the Commonwealth Minister in another place, Mrs Kelly, about these delays if they are the result of the need to get agreement between States before these reports can be presented to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw her attention to one of the matters on the agenda for the conference which related to the increase in cooperation that is supposed to exist between the States and the Commonwealth in sporting matters. If they are going to cooperate in sporting matters and try to coordinate their activities, all I say is that I hope they do it a damned sight better than the way in which they coordinate and cooperate to get their reports of these meetings out. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of matters of some substance in this report which are of concern to the Parliament. One of them relates to tobacco sponsorship in sport. I know that many honourable senators have concerns about this issue. In this report it is noted that, after discussions, the Council, which is made up of Federal, State and New Zealand Ministers for sport, decided to establish a working party to compile a paper for circulation to all State and Territory members outlining options for application of tobacco sponsorship legislation across Australia. I do not know to what stage that has progressed, but I do note that the report also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Members were informed that despite Commonwealth Treasury having estimated that $64 million per annum could be raised by imposing a Commonwealth tax of five cents per tobacco product no decision on the introduction of such a tax had been made. </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt this will be a matter of continuing concern. The other matter I want to raise relates to doping, the use of drugs in sport. As a result of the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, known as the Black Committee-of which I think Senator Crichton-Browne was a member, among other honourable senators who are here now-it was decided that the Council would:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . agree to develop State doping policies consistent with that of the ASC and to provide details of their respective State doping policies to the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that has been done, but I hope that it has. The question of privacy has also been of concern in matters of athletes testing positive to prohibited drugs. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Members were informed that extensive consultations with the Privacy Commission and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission had been undertaken when the ASDA legislation was developed. The Commonwealth indicated that it would reconsider and further advise members on the question of notification to a state institute/academy of any positive test result. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is a real problem that under the privacy provisions apparently there is some restraint on the capacity to let a State sporting academy or institute know that one of its people has been tested positive. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to raise very briefly concerns the fact that States have been getting involved in regional games. In fact, I commend the Northern Territory which hosted the Arafura Games in May 1991, which I attended as a guest of Senator Grant Tambling. The games were brilliantly organised and very well-staged and enhanced Australia's reputation in the area, particularly with Indonesia and Malaysia. Perhaps Senator Evans should have been there to welcome the Malaysian athletes. It was an outstandingly successful regional games and I hope other States will pursue this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report-which I notice the Senate is now about to take note of half an hour before its embargo time of 4 p.m. today-is an important document. Indeed, it is the second most important document from official sources that is produced in the course of any one year. The Budget documents are the most important ones, of course. The Reserve Bank annual report, coming as it traditionally does two days after the introduction of the Budget, gives the Parliament and the community an opportunity to see one of the other major wings of economic policy advice to the Government express its views on the policy situation and the economic situation over the last 12 months and to give its thoughts for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that the annual report this year-which I have only had occasion to glance at very briefly to date and which will certainly bear further consideration-does not have quite the same vigour as the reports of some other years. It is a much more anodyne report than I remember on certain other occasions. In particular, last year or the year before some very interesting material was contained in that report which, quite rightly, drew very sharp attention to, and criticism of, the whole thrust of the Government's economic policy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is right. Some important points are made which I think require a second look. For example, on page 4 the report says that it was during the last financial year-1990-91-that business sentiment swung from optimism to pessimism and new investment dropped off. That drop in business confidence and the drop-off in business investment certainly happened well before that. One of the staggering things in Government policy making in the last 12 months was the fact that the Government so misread the economic situation and the direction in which the economy was travelling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was quite clear when the 1990 Budget was introduced in August last year that the economy was heading for a major downturn. Despite the assurances of the then Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) only three months earlier that there was no way we were going to have a recession, it was quite clear by the time the Budget was introduced last year that we were into a recession, and that developed a full head of steam within weeks of the Budget being introduced, yet the Government did not pick that up in any way when framing the 1990-91 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, new investment-and this is why I believe that the Government should have picked it up much earlier-did not just drop off in the course of 1990-91. Indeed, gross fixed capital expenditure, according to the Australian National Accounts, has fallen in each of the last seven quarters and for something like nine out of the last 12 quarters. So the evidence was there for all to see. I do not think the bank gives sufficient attention to that point in its report. Perhaps this year it is attempting to be more protective of, or less confrontationist toward, the Government than it has been in previous years. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank does draw attention to the progress made in lowering inflation in the last 12 months. In its opening paragraph it states:</PARA>
<PARA>For the first time in many years Australia's inflation rate fell below the OECD average and inflationary expectations took a large step down. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it makes the very important point on the following page that, despite the improvement in the last 12 months, Australia is still behind the best OECD performers in the inflation stakes. The other thing that the report omits to say is that the last time inflation in Australia was below the OECD average for any period of time was during the Fraser years. It is only this year, when we have seen demand collapse as a result of the crunch of the greatest recession in the last 60 years, that we have managed to clobber the Australian economy down to the level where inflation is now below the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Fraser years, when there was growth in the economy, the management of the economy was such as to enable us to have growth and, at the same time, an inflation rate below that of most of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The report spends much time discussing the importance of inflation and the importance of getting it down on a permanent and sustainable basis. It deals with the role of interest rates and monetary policy in that context. Again, it leaves some things half said, which can give a misleading impression. For example, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . nominal interest rates have been lowered, since January 1990, in response to the changes in the economic cycle and the inflationary environment. The very high rates which helped to slow the excessive growth of 1988 and 1989 ceased to be necessary as the economy slowed. Short-term interest rates in June 1991 were 7 1/2 percentage points lower than eighteen months earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> That is certainly true in nominal terms. The point the report does not make is that with the fall of inflation we have had the maintenance of huge real interest rates. It is the real interest rate that is the important consideration in determining investment, consumption and savings decisions. In Australia today we have virtually the highest real interest rate of any country in the Western world. For the bank and the Government to trumpet this fall in interest rates, without talking about real interest rates, is an indictment of them both because it is very misleading indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank is hopeful in its report that inflationary expectations have been lowered on a sustainable and sustained basis. I question that. I hope that the bank is right, but I think there are some very real grounds for doubting that. One only has to look at the Government's own Budget forecast for this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not seem to be widely recognised yet, and certainly many of the economic commentators have not picked up this fact, that the Government in its Budget forecast is going for a growth in average weekly earnings-a growth in wages-of 4 1/2 per cent this year over last year. Treasurer Kerin, in his press statement immediately after the Budget, admitted-and it is extraordinary that this figure is not in the Budget documents-that the June 1992 on June 1991 increase in wages will be no less than 6 per cent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not a relevant point because it will add to the cost expectations. It will also add further to costs right at the time that the Government claims to be expecting some form of economic recovery. The Government reckons it will get economic recovery in the course of the 1992 calendar year-and every person in the business community has told the Government this, but it does not believe them-right at the time that it is going to impose a compulsory new cost on jobs and, therefore, on all costs of input. It will cost this economy something between 50,000 and 101,000 jobs and it will add a minimum of 2 to 4 per cent to inflation. That, I might point out, is a cost which will not be compensated for by this Government by one cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Coming back to the inflationary expectation situation, the Government's own figures point to an underlying surge towards higher inflation. We simply cannot have real wage growth, year on year, of 4 1/2 per cent and June quarter on June quarter of 6 1/2 per cent; inflation at 3 per cent; and growth of GDP at 1 1/2 per cent, which the Government is claiming but which is very low and is probably optimistic. </PARA>
<PARA> Even taking those figures at face value, the only conclusion that can be drawn from them is that they can be achieved only if one of two things happens. The first is an enormous increase in productivity. That is simply not achievable on the basis of our history or on the basis of the scope for increased productivity within an economy that, virtually, will not be growing. That one can be ruled out. The only thing left is a further massive increase in unemployment. There are no alternatives to those conclusions. Both of them in the end-particularly the lack of ability for productivity growth-add up to a further increased cost pressure on the economy and increased inflationary pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the bank, in terms of its comments on inflationary expectations, is correct, but there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that that is optimistic at best. Indeed, in that context, it is very interesting to remind ourselves of the abuse that the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, John Phillips, got last year when he talked about the role of monetary policy and its requirement to be directed at curbing inflation. The then Treasurer, Mr Keating, in perhaps the most disgraceful exhibition of public humiliation and criticism of a public official that I can ever recall, berated the Deputy Governor for expressing such views. Mr Keating and the Government have become very late converts to the cause of lower inflation-very late converts indeed. The conversion has come in the form of rhetoric rather than substantive policy changes to date. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate yesterday, in response to my question to him, Senator Button acknowledged that if the Government in its Budget this year had exercised more and correct financial self discipline, then the level of interest rates would be lower than they now inevitably will be. So yesterday, the Leader of the Government in the Senate admitted that the fiscal laxity in this Budget will cause interest rates to be higher than they should be. That is going to have a very damaging impact on investment and savings and, therefore, on job growth and, indeed, a very detrimental impact on the maintenance of existing jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country in the last 12 months we have had the largest fall in employment in living memory-certainly in the post-war period. In the last 12 months 308,500 people lost their jobs. That is almost 1,000 jobs for every day of the year. The policies that this Government has pursued during that period, and which it is continuing to pursue through a lack of discipline and fiscal responsibility in the Budget, will compound that problem during the year ahead. The great tragedy is that this Government is so concentrated-so obsessed-with its leadership problems and the divisions within it, that it is diverting attention away from the main game, which is trying to get this economy right and doing something for jobs and for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, again, the leadership struggle has resurfaced-not that it needed much resurfacing, but it has bubbled again even more intensely-as a result of the Budget. Great stories are being put around by the supporters of either Mr Keating or Mr Hawke as to the relative merits of the Budget. The amazing thing I find about the Keating camp-if one can believe it-is that Mr Keating nowadays is advocating a whole range of economic policies and an economic policy direction different from that which he was purporting to pursue as recently as two months ago when he was still the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> In that Budget we have seen in particular the better cities plan, which was pushed through, according to all reports-and they have not been denied-by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Deputy, the leader of the Left, Mr Howe, despite strong opposition by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). That decision will cost the Australian taxpayer $800m over the next five years. The main spending requirement of the plan will come at a time when there will be even greater need than at present-if such can be the case-for restraint on government spending. The Government has built a time bomb into the spending process over the next few years as a result of that better cities plan, as occurred in the March industry statement. The Senate might recall that the financial impact of the March industry statement decisions in the first year, 1991-92, will amount to $447m; that next year, 1992-93, it will amount to about $850m; and that the following year the cost to the taxpayer will be $1.2 billion. Again, we have a series of economic policy decisions which, when they are implemented, will lead to increased pressures on the Budget, therefore on taxpayers, therefore on interest rates, therefore on investment, and therefore, inevitably, on jobs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The great indictment of this Government is that, two days ago when it had the opportunity in the Budget to do something for the people of Australia, who want above all an opportunity to work and to have some security in their job situation, it made a series of decisions which, collectively, added up not to any good news on the job front but, inevitably, to a worsening in that situation. The Reserve Bank report is important in that context. It gives a somewhat different perspective in terms of official advice to government. It rightly stresses the critical importance of inflationary expectations and of the need to continue at all costs to bear down on inflation if we want in time a productive, dynamic economy that can create increased living standards and jobs for our people. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, whilst the performance has not matched the rhetoric, the Reserve Bank report is to be commended for what it says about the importance of inflation. It warrants further consideration by us all. In the meantime, I welcome its tabling today. I think it is an important contribution to the economic policy debate, although there are points about it that one obviously would have some real doubts about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very thorough analysis and the inconsistencies that have been drawn to the Senate's attention this afternoon in the content of the annual report and financial statements of the Reserve Bank of Australia by Senator Jim Short, representing the shadow Treasurer in this chamber, must give Treasury officials, banking leaders and business personnel great comfort that in a coalition government the finance portfolio is in such strong hands. The Reserve Bank Act, which is one of several pieces of legislation which define the functions, powers and responsibilities of the Reserve Bank, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is the duty of the Board, within the limits of its powers, to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank under this Act, the Banking Act 1959 and the regulations under that Act are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Board, will best contribute to the stability of the currency of Australia; the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It would appear that the Government has available to it in the form of the Reserve Bank a means by which to address a few of the economic problems which currently face Australia.

Nowhere was that role stressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Government has insisted on binding the hands and muzzling the mouth of the Reserve Bank, instead of giving it full rein to act in a way that would allow it to carry out its duty as set out in the Act-those words that I have just mentioned. The question of the autonomy of the Reserve Bank has been on the political agenda for some time now and, unfortunately, it still remains unresolved. There are many examples around the world, such as among our Pacific neighbours-New Zealand being the nearest-where the Reserve Bank has been given autonomy and specific goals to work towards. We always thought those objectives were goals but, unfortunately, our Reserve Bank is not meeting those objectives at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have to reform the operations of the Reserve Bank to ensure that it acts in the best interests of our country. From a reading of the annual report and the chapter entitled `The Focus of Policy', a strong link between the Government and the Reserve Bank is evident. Phrases such as low inflation being `an important pre-condition for sustained economic progress in the 1990s' are straight out of the Budget Papers. That chapter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Inflation remained the focus of monetary policy even after the surge in demand had passed. Last year's Report, with its theme of inflation, reflected the Bank's belief that a consistent framework throughout the whole of the economic cycle would be necessary to lower inflation decisively. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the recent actions of the Government on the wages front, including the Budget-announced policy directives on superannuation, will only lead to a further breakdown of what should be a coherent wages policy, and such demonstrable actions make a mockery and a complete sham of its inflation-fighting priority, which has now been stated in two reports of the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Industries in Australia must be encouraged to become more competitive to increase job opportunities, and government policies must be directed to this end. I remind the Senate that real interest rates-that is, the difference between the nominal rates and the inflation rates-are historically high in such depressed conditions. The deliberately high interest rates pursued by the Government are maintaining an artificially high exchange rate. Not only does the interest input factor impact on cost to businesses, thereby diminishing profit, but it also reduces consumer demand. At the same time an artificially high exchange rate which is exacerbated by a high interest regime has the impact of reducing the relative cost of imported goods which are in competition with locally produced goods. Therefore, interest rates must be brought down to save the economy from a further dramatic collapse in conditions which have been unparalleled since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MICHAEL BAUME (New South Wales) (3.59 p.m) I too want to speak briefly to the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia. It is a very important report because, as Senator Short said, while it does not have the fire and brimstone of Mr John Phillips's report of a couple of years ago-which said that the Reserve Bank was right and the then Treasurer and Treasury were patently wrong-parts of this report dramatise the collapse, the failure, of government policy. Even though those parts of it are written in very restrained language, the pointers are there, and no doubt Senator McMullan will be eagerly looking to those pointers when I line them up for him. The first point I would like to make is that the Reserve Bank said:</PARA>
<PARA>Even before the national accounts and the labour market confirmed the weakness of the economy, it was clear that the slowing in activity was greater than had been expected. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government was lying to us for months and months about the real nature of the downturn. Yet the Reserve Bank says that it was clear that the slowing down was greater than had been expected. The report, to an extent, tries to justify the incorrect forecasts at this time last year. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Those assumptions were reasonably close to the mark, although the sluggishness of world industrial output contributed to a significant fall in Australia's commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The terms of trade, while they did show a downturn, continued to be higher than they had been in the 1982-83 recession, which the Government likes to remind everyone about continually, generally with totally false and massively incorrect analogies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank, in referring to the corporate balance sheet assets becoming hard pressed by reduced cash flows and declining assets prices, particularly in respect of commercial property, along with the significant fall in commodity prices, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>These developments, which had not been widely forecast, led several financial intermediaries (and other repositories of household savings) into difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government did not know about this and seemed to be caught absolutely unprepared. I would have thought that the Reserve Bank should have been in a position to have a better level of information about the downturn in balance sheet assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank says that price expectations will remain at low levels only if the public maintains its confidence in the Government's anti-inflationary resolve. There is a clear warning for this Government, which I certainly hope Senator McMullan takes on board. There must be a great level of difficulty within the business community in accepting the fact that the Government should be given confidence in its anti-inflationary resolve. How can the Australian community have any confidence when the left wing of the Labor Party opposes even the present Budget? It is demanding further spending, and Mr Hawke must be a captive of the left wing in order to remain in power. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition's policies, which over the years have been attacked by the Government because they demanded that there be a reduction in inflation, are totally confirmed by the Reserve Bank annual report, which underlined the following:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . living with high rates of inflation, out of concern for the costs of reducing it, is not a credible policy . . . inflation perverts the taxation system and the pattern and financing of investment, and the way income and wealth are redistributed in favour of those best placed to take advantage of those distortions. </PARA>
<PARA>I notice that all the people who are described as Bob Hawke's mates seem to be in that category, at least while the situation was going their way. The report says that more recently the authorities have been attaching greater priority to reducing inflation after early attempts to slow it had made only limited progress. All these factors and particularly the sustained high real interest rates needed to reduce inflation have also helped to change the environment in which business operates. Why on earth was it only recently that the authorities attached greater priority to reducing inflation? As the report says, inflation perverts the taxation system and results in long term economic disaster, which is what we have had. On inflation, the bank said:</PARA>
<PARA>By the end of July, ten-year bond yields were about 11 per cent, compared with the latest CPI-based estimate of inflation of less than 5 per cent, leaving Australian real bond yields at the high end of the international spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Short said, our real interest rates are very high by international standards. In fact, since then, they have got relatively higher than at least one or 1 1/2 percentage points. As the bank said-and this is a key point; this is key subtle criticism of this Government:</PARA>
<PARA>To the extent that this reflects a premium for uncertainty about future inflation, it suggests that inflationary expectations need to be brought down further . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the markets do not trust this Government, and they have no reason to do so. That is why this matter of expectations, which Senator McMullan did not seem to understand when Senator Short was speaking, are so absolutely vital. One of the points that the Reserve Bank made disagrees with what Senator Cook and Senator Button have been saying recently in Question Time. They have been denying that there is any relationship between wage levels and unemployment at any point. The Reserve Bank said:</PARA>
<PARA>The pace of this recovery is likely to be somewhat slower than recoveries from previous recessions, in part because of the corporate debt overhang and in part because policies are expected to remain relatively firm. This could limit the size of the increase in employment during 1991-92 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where they get the idea of there being an increase in employment. The Budget figures show a fall in the levels of employment. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . although the trend in wage costs will also be critical in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank said that the trend in wage costs is critical to levels of employment. Frankly, I would much rather believe the Reserve Bank on this matter than Senator Cook, who has just come in, because Senator Cook's assertions that wage levels have nothing to do with employment levels are clearly totally demolished by the Reserve Bank itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Despite what the Reserve Bank says here, the Government is going not only for a 6 per cent June-on-June wage rise but also for a big increase in the cost of employment at the end of that series, which will affect cost expectations-that is, a tax on employment involved in the superannuation payments. The report continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While the current account deficit has been reduced in 1990/91-</PARA>
<PARA>this is one of the Government's great achievements-</PARA>
<PARA>some of this reduction reflects cyclical factors which will be unwound as the economy recovers. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that, if it is not a fundamental or basic reduction, the Government is going to face more and more trouble. The Reserve Bank is carefully pointing that out. However, one of the key elements of criticism that the Reserve Bank made of this Government is implicit at the bottom of page 18. When arguing that the main task for monetary policy this year is to peg the progress that has been made on inflation over the past year, it said:</PARA>
<PARA>Cyclical falls in inflation-where prices slow in response to weak activity-have occurred in the past . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It pointed out that inflation dropped from 12 per cent in 1982 to a little over 5 per cent in 1984. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>On that occasion much of the gain was lost within a couple of years, an outcome which policy makers are determined to avoid on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we had all the pain to get the inflation rate down to 5 per cent in 1984 when this Government was in office. It destroyed our chances by its incompetent and disgraceful budgetary policy, and its lack of fiscal policy in 1984, 1985 and 1986. It destroyed our chances of having a sustained lower level of inflation. The Reserve Bank points that out exactly. That is when the failures of this Government's policies first impacted. </PARA>
<PARA> As we in Opposition have been saying for years, we are now suffering the consequences of that policy disaster by the Treasurer who at that time was being touted as the world's greatest treasurer. He set the scene and destroyed the results of all the pain of the 1982-83 recession. The Government bought short term success by increasing employment at huge and overwhelming long term cost to this country-huge foreign debt-and now huge, entrenched unemployment. The report of the Reserve Bank states:</PARA>
<PARA>An important part of the ongoing process is for wage-setting over the coming year to embody these lower price expectations. </PARA>
<PARA>If wage setting is to embody lower price expectations, I wonder why the Government is boosting wages so much. Why is it disagreeing with the Reserve Bank? Why is it flying in the face of its advice? The Reserve Bank then gives a little bit of a passing gesture to the Government's policy by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>That does not imply any reduction in real living standards; a decent productivity performance would allow goods prices to rise more slowly than wage costs. </PARA>
<PARA>But then, here is the sting in the tail; it goes on to say that what is needed is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . structural changes and improvements in work practices . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It does say that business and government instrumentalities have implemented things during these years. But the fact is-as we have seen on the waterfront-that these structural changes are minimal and have achieved only a fraction of what is vitally needed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policies have concentrated on the need for massive structural change. For example, Mr Howard has been at the forefront of this with labour market reform. All the time that Dr Hewson has been in this Parliament, he has been calling for structural change. It is absolutely vital. The Reserve Bank here in its report is supporting the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this Reserve Bank report, even though it is in very modest terms, quite clearly provides an indictment of this Government's incompetence going back to 1984 when it dropped the ball. Instead of chasing the ball, it has been kicking the people of Australia vigorously and unfairly, when it should have done what it had the opportunity to do-win the game for us. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night the Speaker, in answer to a question, tabled a copy of the agreement reached between the Presiding Officers, the Trades and Labor Council and the Liquor Trades Union in the presence of the Minister for Industrial Relations. In also tabling the agreement, I advise honourable senators that the basis of the settlement was that former employees of the PCS can either retain their redundancy payment or choose income maintenance in accordance with aims to provide assistance to people who have been made redundant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the former employees choose income maintenance, they must repay the severance element of their redundancy payment. Under the agreement, former PCS employees have until 20 September to decide whether they wish to retain their redundancy payment or take income maintenance. Consequently, it will not be known how many people wish to take up the offer of income maintenance until 20 September. However, I understand that sufficient funds will be available within the sum allocated by the Department of Finance to run the PCS this financial year to cover this one-off payment.</PARA>
<PARA> The agreement is in accordance with normal Federal public sector redundancy arrangements and represents payments or benefits, the range of which would be generally available in similar circumstances in public sector employment. It has, at all times, been the goal of the Speaker and me that staff should be treated fairly, that the proceedings of Parliament should not be disrupted and that our obligations for the efficient and economic operation of Parliament House be discharged. These goals have been fully achieved. I table the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that by contracting out, we expect to reduce the subsidy to $1m per year, which will be some $1.2m less than we achieved under the previous arrangement. This process was in line with the Government's policy of micro-economic reform. The Speaker and I have at all times observed proper employer and industrial policies. This has been confirmed by proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission in relation to our alleged respondency to an award of the Commission and in the fact that an agreement putting in place processes acceptable to all parties has been reached.</PARA>
<PARA> In all industrial disputes there are instant experts and it is fair to say that in this dispute the matter might still be at a stalemate without the intervention of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), both as an honest broker and as an adviser on acceptable industrial practice. We had reached a stalemate and in all such circumstances, both parties are required to give a little. In this case, we agreed to adopt acceptable redundancy, retention and redeployment provisions while refusing the union's claim to overturn the contract and revert to the previous arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill yesterday accused the Speaker and me of weakness in dealing with the picket imposed by the TLC. I reiterate that at no time were the proceedings of the Parliament seriously disrupted. Contrary to claims, there was no great delay in getting mail in or out of the building, newspapers were delivered and the work of the chambers went on as usual. Despite some claims that the Budget would be disrupted, normal procedure followed. The only inconvenience was that members and senators had to walk a few hundred yards to their offices.</PARA>
<PARA> I might remind senators that neither the Speaker nor I have responsibility for Commonwealth cars, nor was the picket placed within the parliamentary precincts, where the Speaker and I would have had powers to engineer its removal. I indicated earlier in the dispute that the proceedings of Parliament would not be disrupted, and they were not. I indicated that the Speaker and I would spare no effort to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible, and that has now been done. It has been done in the normal manner whereby industrial disputes of this nature are resolved by negotiation and conciliation. I thank the Minister for Industrial Relations for his role in the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>We will obviously want to give careful consideration to the detail of your statement, Mr President. I have to confess that at first blush it seems that the intervention of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has meant that further taxpayers' funds have been expended in resolving this dispute, but we will consider that and might comment upon it in due course. However, I want at this time to make a further comment on the pickets, particularly in view of the comment you just made, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of this side of the chamber that the picket was an illegal obstruction. Contrary to what Senator Cooney indicated yesterday, the pickets were stopping the passage of vehicles. That is an illegal activity. In some instances, picketers were searching vehicles that were entering the precincts of the Parliament. That is also illegal. It should not have been tolerated and it should not have been particularly condoned by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), who said in this chamber that he supported the picket and therefore he supported the illegal activity. That is not the way in which we on this side of the chamber believe that industrial relations should be practised. We will maintain that position. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, regardless of whether it was a hindrance simply in relation to the Parliament-which it was because senators' mail was hindered, senators' access to printing facilities was hindered and in other ways their work was hindered-it involved a principle that applies to all institutions, to all enterprise in Australia. Australians who wish to go about their work should not be hindered by illegal picketing. As Senator Crane is aware, it is what has happened in the meat industry in Victoria, with dire consequences. It is not the direction which industrial relations should take in this country, and this Government should not accept that it should. That remains our position and it will continue to be our position. Mr President, we will consider your statement and perhaps bring it on for debate when the Senate resumes after the break. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have heard your statement. I think it is a full and fair presentation of the circumstances of this matter. I thank you and your fellow Presiding Officer, the Speaker, for your comments about my role in this matter. I say in that respect that if I had a role at all it was simply to provide a focal point upon which the parties could come together and provide a forum in which they could talk through the problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case dismissals in employment had occurred, the employer-employee relationship which would give access to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in normal circumstances did not obtain, and the re-employment of some workers by the contractor complicated the situation as to whether or not an avenue into the Industrial Relations Commission could be found. The case was complicated to the point at which, if the parties had wished to be difficult about the matter, the matter would not then have gone to a conference-a normal event in these circumstances-in the Commission. My role was simply to provide, in the absence of the normal circumstances, an avenue for discussion, and to provide whatever background I might have in this subject to aid the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> It is indeed true that the parties in the end came to their own agreement-as advised and as assisted, of course. The fact that the agreement has now been accepted, that the dispute is now over, that the pickets have now been removed and that any minor impediment-nay, irritation-which may have occurred has gone as well is a tribute to the parties. It is something I think this Parliament, and this chamber in particular, should celebrate. A matter that was difficult and sensitive has been removed, and that is a good thing. I think that commendation is due, Mr President, both to you and to Mr Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the pickets has been raised in comments by Senator Hill not just today but also on previous occasions. Senator Hill takes a point of view which I think anyone is entitled to take; that is, that there are acts which some may hold to be illegal being performed, and that the full force of the law should be visited upon those against whom it is alleged there is law breaking going on. That is a point which anyone can make which several people argue strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> I see in the recent events in Canberra no comparison with events that may or may not occur in the meat industry, which has been referred to by Senator Hill. Nor do I see in the recent events in Canberra any onerous impositions, because, as has been said in the President's statement, the normal affairs of the Parliament at a sensitive time such as Budget time went ahead without complication. Nonetheless, the point still can be made. To that point I say this: the strength of law in matters of this nature is best regarded with some tolerance. It is not unusual that in areas of law dealing with social questions or questions of an industrial relations matter tolerance, moderation and sensitivity are shown. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that because we ran the risk here of having an escalation of this dispute, which would have obfuscated the primary reason for the disagreement and transported the dispute to a level dealing with fundamental questions that divided the parties. The logical outcome would have been that the dispute would have run for a long time, that the ability to resolve it would have vanished and that the possibility of then engaging in a dispute about other factors which so deeply divide this community would have arisen. When one comes to a set of circumstances such as this, one should approach it with a sense of some tolerance about the activities being engaged in, but with a keen idea that the primary issues in contention need to be identified. As non-contentious a climate as possible should be created so that the parties can be brought together to discuss the real issues that divide them to see whether, on a more considered view, an answer can be found. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances, what has unfolded is a tribute to the tolerance, moderation and sensible behaviour of both sides. We now have an outcome and, because we have an outcome, 20 : 20 hindsight can be applied as to whether or not those involved conducted themselves properly. I do not think anyone was injured. No delay occurred to this chamber, as far as I can tell, and any inconvenience that may have occurred was moderate. I quite enjoyed the short walk from the picket line to the House, which is a walk that I now regret I do not have every day. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an outcome which is acceptable and which, in terms of the statement just put down by the Presiding Officers, incurs no extra penalty in terms of supplementation on the budget of the Parliament. Any question that has been raised by Senator Hill about taxpayers' money needs to be looked at from that point of view. I understand that the settlement that has been obtained can be handled within the normal guidelines of the Department of Finance on matters of this nature. If one wants to try to pretend that this is a dispute resolved at the expense of the taxpayer, I think that is a hard row to hoe. </PARA>
<PARA> The Presiding Officers made a decision based on investigation and report that it was desirable in their management of the Parliamentary Catering Service that the service be put out for tender and be let to a contractor. That is a decision which is in their right to make. The Opposition has offered no objection to it. I assume, therefore, that in this case silence can be regarded as support for the decision of the Presiding Officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that a decision of that nature is made there is clearly a human resource management problem, to put it in the jargon of the issue. A number of people, 147 in total in this case, faced immediate loss of employment. Ten of those people who were covered by an award for retention and redeployment did not lose their jobs but 137 faced immediate loss of employment. That is the law and no-one argues that that is not the law. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are provisions that apply in the case of redundancy. The Presiding Officers made, I think, a quite reasonable settlement on the redundancy front. However, in the economic circumstances of the time-circumstances in which this Government takes no comfort whatsoever-there is, unfortunately, a high level of unemployment which gives anxiety to individuals facing a depressed labour market with little opportunity in a smaller city setting like Canberra of finding alternative jobs for themselves. It is no wonder in those circumstances that their anxiety arises. </PARA>
<PARA> How those matters are resolved are matters of judgment and degree. They are not matters of perfect understanding. There is no scientific explanation of applying some particular formula whereby all human problems are dealt with in a logical framework. It requires judgment and degree. </PARA>
<PARA> The underlying legal issue was whether these employees were entitled to coverage by the redundancy and redeployment award, colloquially known as the RRR award. That matter was dealt with by the Commission and their entitlement was found not to exist. In the settlement arrived at the standards held up by that award have not been met. So the Presiding Officers are not in a situation of having found one level in the Commission at which they were not obliged to observe certain standards and then having gone out and obliged those standards. The standards are different. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the standards that are different are standards which a compassionate employer, in recognition of the realities of the labour market, the low wages of the workers concerned and the lack of job opportunities, would make to ensure that in a transition of managerial arrangements occasioned by economic need and not the responsibility of the workers concerned, the workers would not be the victims of the decision that was necessary out of economic need, and their needs would be reasonably met. I think that is a tribute to the employers concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is an imputation, as seemed to occur in a question to the Speaker yesterday from the former Leader of the National Party, that the terms of the settlement may be too lavish, all that I have said would rebut that because there is a need to recognise the circumstances and deal with them. However, if honourable senators in this place at some time want to try to sustain an argument of that nature, under the general catering award that now applies to employees of the contractor, I point out that the highest rate is that for a chef. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate for a chef in the general award is $19,776. That is the award rate. We are not talking about workers who live high on the hog. We are talking about low income earners in this country. We stand here as members of this place receiving a base salary of $64,768. If the imputation is that the settlement has been lavish, one ought to see ourselves as others outside this chamber see us-people in receipt of a base salary of $64,768 complaining about a settlement which would ensure that workers receiving $19,776 might have an opportunity over six months to try to find alternative employment at around that level and might find an opportunity to be redeployed somewhere else in the Commonwealth or, at the end of that time, face unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever huffing and puffing might go on if this point is raised, honourable senators should keep in the back of their minds the disparities in income that we are talking about. I return to the point: these are low income earners. It ill behoves us to rail against a settlement, which in a flat labour market enables them to have some security, to find alternative employment. Frankly, we would be seen, dare I say it, as hypocrites were we to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The negotiation that occurred is, in microcosm, what is being debated in macrocosm about industrial policy. The Opposition would say about industrial policy that enterprise bargaining is the model. That is often said-Mr Howard says it frequently. He does not define its meaning. However, in these circumstances negotiations were conducted by the management in the form of the Presiding Officers with the workers and their union in the form of the catering staff. They arrived at an outcome without benefit of the Commission, which is an exact definition of what the Opposition talks about in its industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that it has worked on this occasion should be something that the Opposition commends rather than opposes because this is the model that it wants to force on the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am glad to have this opportunity of speaking to the report of the Australian Soil Conservation Council on its meeting in Nelson, New Zealand. In doing so, I want to first congratulate all those in the Australian community who are making strenuous efforts to promote soil conservation activities across Australia. Senator Brownhill also asked me to associate himself with the remarks on this report because he has had to go to another meeting this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent years we have often heard of several pressing issues in environmental matters which have been competing for the public's attention, including energy, pollution and the greenhouse effect. But soil degradation would be our most basic issue. Often in the media it is forgotten and there do not seem to be many votes in this issue when politicians parade before the public their concerns about the environment. Yet soil degradation would be Australia's No. 1 environmental issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Over thousands of years, floods, dry spells and the prevailing wind patterns have combined to strip numerous layers of the fine, fertile soil from Australia's surface. Most of it has ended up in the Pacific and Indian oceans, stretching out from the coastline in two plumes to the north-west and south-east, mirroring the prevailing wind systems. We all would have read numerous stories about windblown soil from the Australian mainland which is regularly dumped on the New Zealand Alps. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing is more important to a nation's environment than its soil and the preservation of the quality of its land. The loss of our thin and fragile soil, the progressive degradation of our land and the expansion of the desert and arid areas of the Australian continent would be our No.1 environmental challenge. Left unmet, the result will be a disaster on a massive scale for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1983, about 66 per cent of all our lands were in need of some conservation measures. Significant long term problems have also arisen as a result of the progressive breaking down of the structure of Australian soils. Soil conservation is of particular importance not only to the greenies, to whom this Government and the media often pander, but it is of vital importance to those Australians who often have much more to do with the environment, and that is the man and the woman on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Only in the past few years has the subject of soil degradation come a little into focus. This is due partly to the fact that during the past few years Australia has experienced a series of storms, droughts and floods which were directly or indirectly related to the problems. Also, the nation's stocktaking during the Bicentenary brought a reawakening of concern for what has been happening to Australia's land. It is estimated that about half of Australia's rural land requires treatment for land degradation. Human activity has been responsible for about half of that degradation. Indeed, Australian farmers play the leading role in the environment, caring for over 200 million animals and millions of square kilometres of land. The care of this nation's environment, to a remarkable degree, is already in their hands. </PARA>
<PARA> Agriculture is a sustainable and renewable industry, yet there is growing criticism, much of it from ignorance, of farming practices. Indeed the report notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . although the rural recession has reduced the scale of soil conservation work, it has not reduced landholders' commitment to land care. </PARA>
<PARA>That is because farming is very much a family activity with a number of generations usually working the same farm. Consequently, there is a powerful incentive for each generation to leave the land in a better state than that in which they found it. The majority of farmers have for decades been environmentally conscious and have taken many initiatives to improve the environment. As a matter of fact, in our Kingaroy area farmers really apply rules for soil conservation to their farms, as no doubt do farmers in many other rural areas of Australia. They consult with their soil conservation experts in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and take action to ensure the best conservation of their land. This is very necessary in Queensland at present when everything is so very dry. A farmer has just taken over a new farm opposite to where I live and he has put a lot of time, money and work into making sure that he conserves the land. I commend the work done by many in the community on land care programs, but I also note that we cannot leave the fight against soil degradation solely to farmers, who are already battling other outside forces and are currently being squeezed on all sides.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Report No. 5 on details of determinations made under the Higher Education Funding Act sets out the grants for higher education under different sections of the Act which, in total, amount to $2.9 billion. I want to mention areas of particular concern, not only to me but to everybody engaged in higher education today. In particular, I want to focus upon section 21 grants which are for projects of national priority. There were 14 separate determinations during 1990 and more than half of them were wholly or partially for expenses related to the wasted amalgamation exercises. This is sadly typical of what the Hawke Labor Government is doing to promote the clever country. Section 21 grants should be for research projects or for the development of new courses. The total amount for 1990 was $28m, but a large proportion of this total was eroded in 1990 to pay for amalgamation expenses which institutions did not want and which since that time have led to a very low state of morale in our universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is that we do not know from this report exactly how much was spent on the amalgamation exercise. The determinations for the year 1990 are all listed with the date and the purpose of each determination, but no amount is listed against the determinations themselves. All the report provides is the total amount and the amounts which went to individual institutions, but it is impossible to marry those amounts with the determinations. So we know what institutions received money but we do not know for what purpose. For instance, the Australian National University received $315,000 under section 21 in 1990, but over half of this amount-$200,000-was for amalgamation expenses. I was only able to find this out by direct inquiry to the Australian National University, because the information was not available in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 23 grants for 1990 amounting to $147m provide assistance to institutions for special research centres. There is considerable disquiet in the higher education community about the amount of government intrusion into the funding of research in Australia. The Australian National University put out a fact sheet in May which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia needs a pluralistic system for setting research priorities, not a highly centralised system in which the judgments of a few committees dominate decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Stephen Committee, commissioned by the Government, endorsed the Australian National University view. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is value in there being a plurality of sources of research funding so that different perspectives can be brought to bear on the merits of different areas of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Government, through Minister Baldwin, announced in March this year that it proposed to destroy the independence of the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU by reallocating all the funds for the School of Medical Research to the National Health and Medical Research Council and by giving the Australian Research Council an intrusive role in the funding of its other schools. In a recent graduation address, Professor Peter Karmel said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to emphasise that the case for institutional autonomy stems . . . from the knowledge that universities will better achieve their purposes in serving a free society by self-government than by detailed intervention on the part of public authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The time has come for those of us who believe in the importance of higher education for this country and the people who live in it, to proclaim loudly and clearly that the integrity and autonomy of our universities must not be eroded. </PARA>
<PARA>I endorse these comments from Professor Karmel. Government interference with and intervention into higher education has had catastrophic results. We now have a bureaucratically administered system dominated by ministerial discretion. At a time when the Government is promoting the clever country, the Government does everything it can to bully, to blackmail, to bludgeon institutions into forced amalgamations or new arrangements, such as the centralised method of allocating research money. This threatens the autonomy and independence of our very valuable higher education system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Customs (Rainforest Timber) Amendment Bill 1990 not only on my own behalf but also, I think, to put on the record the Government's position that it will not support this legislation and to put some argument on the record as to why that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset I would like Senator Coulter to know, in presenting this Bill, that it is not his intention or his sentiments that I am opposing. He is not alone in this chamber in being very concerned about the rate of destruction of tropical rainforests around the world. Indeed, as he pointed out in his speech, the rate of that destruction is increasing at a fearful pace-an exponential rate, perhaps Senator Coulter would say. That is due to a number of things. One reason is an interesting new desire on the part of people to possess rainforest timber. Another reason is that we now have a huge advantage in terms of getting that timber. Whereas previously people might have had to slog into a rainforest and chop such timber by axe, now we have huge mechanical devices to fell timber and to clear and haul it away. Therefore the mechanical capacity now to destroy or harvest such forests is contributing to the rate of destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> In rising to oppose the Bill I am not disagreeing with the sentiments expressed by Senator Coulter and his comments about the importance of protecting our rainforests, because they are becoming more and more depleted and a rarer and rarer commodity. However, the point that I wish to make on behalf of the Government by way of justification for our opposing the Bill is that Senator Coulter's Bill fails to deal with the very complex nature of the issue he is confronting. </PARA>
<PARA> His legislation proposes some prescriptive measures whose implementation and likely effectiveness have not been thought through and, indeed, are not likely to achieve even the intention that his Bill sets out to address. For example, the administrative framework of how the Australian Customs Service would prohibit or restrict the importation of certain tropical rainforest timbers into this country is not made clear in his Bill. How would, for example, anybody in Customs be able to tell whether timber had been felled in a tropical rainforest or in a regrowth forest? As I understand it, this legislation does not object to the importation of tropical rainforest timbers from regrowth forests. This is a complication and an administrative difficulty that seem to be insufficiently addressed in Senator Coulter's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Government-as I said, it is not just myself but the Government-is very concerned about this matter and while it is in sympathy with Senator Coulter's Bill it has taken a different approach. The Government is aware that one cannot try to tackle such a complex issue in a limited or simple way. The Government's approach is to address this complex matter in a much more comprehensive way. What the Government has been giving consideration to are the very large differences and the need to balance the conservation needs of forests and, at the same time, the demand for forestry timber. The changes and improvements in logging practices-indeed, the question of value adding of timber resources-and the pricing of tropical timber to take into account the environmental cost have been taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the point raised by Senator Coulter about the speed with which tropical rainforests are disappearing from the face of this world. One would have to say that that speed of disappearance is no doubt increasing very considerably the value of what is left. I do not think that either Senator Coulter or I would take any comfort from that increased value of the remaining resource but at the same time I think we have a very inadequate way of trying to work out the value of that resource. Whether it is increasing in value or not, we still have to address the serious issue of trying to come to some way of adequately determining the value of that kind of resource. We need also to look at how we price that resource if it is allowed to be chopped down and sold. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing we have to address when considering the rainforests of other countries is our relationship with those countries. Of recent times we have certainly seen the importance of good relations with neighbouring countries in our own region. It has not been without note that our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has been visiting Malaysia and making sure that relations with that country continue favourably for both them and us. Tropical rainforest legislation requires those sorts of considerations to be addressed and properly dealt with before it is brought into this place. If the legislation were brought in and those issues were not dealt with I presume that we could expect a minimal satisfactory outcome from that kind of haste. </PARA>
<PARA> We need also to look at the capacity of government to assist financially with forest and environment projects, particularly in regard to rainforests overseas. This is particularly important as we have come to know over the past few years-I think perhaps that is one of the benefits of television-that the rights of indigenous forest dwellers need to be taken into account. Perhaps there is the need for producer countries to address the question of how they set aside permanent forest estates. However, for some of the countries to decide to do that would require them almost completely to reappraise their economies. It is a very difficult thing for Australia to consider legislation that may require those kinds of considerations to be addressed. We have no power to address them, but it is important that they are addressed. I think that for all these reasons the Government has been concerned to hasten slowly, to be more comprehensive in addressing all of those problems, so that when it does introduce such legislation and takes steps to address this very important issue all of those concerns will be covered. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of this process the Government asked Coopers and Lybrand, in consultation with Forestry Technical Services Pty Ltd, or Fortech, to undertake a report. That was commissioned in September 1989. It was asked to look at, amongst other things, the extent of Australia's international trade in tropical timbers, the impact of this trade on both Australian consumers and tropical timber source countries, and options for increasing tropical forest management and protection. The consultancy report was completed in April 1990. Indeed, Senator Coulter, in his speech, examined that report very closely and addressed a number of the issues that were raised in it. I think it is fair to say that he was somewhat scathing in his dismissal of the outcome of the report. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Scathing. Indeed, it is also true that he was not persuaded that the report would help the Government address this issue seriously. Notwithstanding Senator Coulter's speech, the Government has accepted that report and, as a result, has established an interdepartmental committee comprising a number of departments, including the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Department of Administrative Services, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. They have compiled comprehensive advice on the full range of those issues involved in tropical forest conservation. That interdepartmental committee has reported to the relevant Ministers. As a result of that report, the Government therefore has the information necessary to act on the recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding that, and in case it sounds as though the Government is not intent on doing anything to this point, I remind the Senate that in the recent Budget the new environmental assistance program was announced. It significantly expands the assistance for environmental projects and programs in international development and allows for cooperation between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Ros Kelly, and the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of the new environment assistance program in the forest sector is an allocation of $4.3m in 1991-92 to enable the continuation of bilateral programs in Papua New Guinea and the ASEAN region as well as enabling new bilateral and multilateral activities to be commenced in those areas and in the South Pacific. It is clear that, by addressing our region, the Government is trying to focus its efforts and to maximise their effect rather than spreading our contribution and interest widely across every rainforest country in this world. I am sure that that will cause some angst in some places, but it is the Government's intention to try to regionalise and focus its efforts, particularly under this new environmental assistance program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also continue supporting its program with a grant of $1.4m to the Papua New Guinea national forest action plan, which will assist projects to achieve sustainable use of Papua New Guinea's forests. Amongst other things, it will include funding for a training program to try to improve tropical forest management in South East Asia, along with the Papua New Guinea forest action plan. That extra training program will receive $700,000. We cannot overlook the importance of this. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the pleasure of a very brief visit to Ethiopia. It is one of the few countries that are on the public record as saying it has been so dramatically deforested that it now acknowledges its changing climate and weather patterns as the cause of the extensive and fairly rapid deforestation of large tracts of its country. The point of Senator Coulter's Bill and the Government's behaviour is to try to prevent the massive denuding and deforestation of countries and the dramatic consequences of land degradation and the dislocation of populations, which have huge economic implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hate my words to be understood to mean that I put more value on the economic aspect of the issue than the economic dislocation of peoples; I do not. Indeed, one probably cannot be separated from the other. I suppose that the hardest pain that has to be borne from this kind of rape of primary preserves is the damage it does to people. The short dollar return of tearing out tropical rainforests in anyone's eyes has a long term effect. One does not have to look too far into the future to see the damage it does to people, in terms not only of economic loss but also of displacement. </PARA>
<PARA> The protection of tropical rainforests around the world is something that the Government is committed to. To this point it is trying to maintain that commitment through the new Budget initiatives such as the environment assistance program that I have just outlined and new activities which invest further moneys into the sustainable use and management of tropical forests in South East Asia and the South Pacific countries. It will also continue its contributions through international organisations supporting sustainable tropical forest projects such as the International Tropical Timber Organisation, the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The contribution there amounts to some $900,000 for 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> Even just listing the number of international or Australian research organisations and/or the projects that are happening in the countries in the so-called South Pacific region highlights the complexity of this issue and the need to address the problem comprehensively. In outlining these bits of Government initiative, I pick up on some of the points that Senator Coulter suggested in his speech would be necessary. I take his point that we would not want to include all of them under the one piece of legislation, though I say by way of some criticism that, if we want all those things to happen and we address them only in a second reading speech, that is probably not a sufficient way of addressing it. That is one reason why the Government has reservations about Senator Coulter's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Rainforest conservation is a very important area, and the Government takes it very seriously. It is addressing that in a comprehensive way. For those reasons, the Government will not be supporting Senator Coulter's Bill, despite the sympathy we have with its intention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I rise in dismay, with some disillusionment and with great disappointment that neither the Opposition nor the Government can see fit to support a very important piece of legislation which addresses a very significant issue. I listened a few moments ago to Senator Bjelke-Petersen speaking of land degradation in this country. She rightly pointed to the fact that it had a low priority but was a very important issue. As Senator Crowley has just said, and as I pointed out in my second reading speech, there are a number of ways of tackling aspects of this problem of the destruction of tropical rainforests and the loss of the cultures of some 1,000 indigenous people who still live in those tropical rainforests around the world. As I pointed out in my second reading speech, it is quite inappropriate to attempt to tackle all those issues within one piece of legislation, but this is one significant thing that Australia can do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress again that when one is dealing with complex issues, which of course have economic consequences and consequences in terms of relationships with other governments, one clearly must set some sort of priority. What really annoys me is that this chamber is incapable of recognising the very important priority which must be accorded the enormous loss of the tropical rainforests of this globe and the species and indigenous cultures which they contain. That issue must override, in any sane, sensible, informed, intelligent set of priorities around this area, all these other considerations. I find it very depressing that the Opposition and the Government in this chamber cannot recognise the overriding priority that must be given to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, we heard from the Opposition particularly, and less from Senator Crowley, I must say, that the sensitivities of the Malaysian Government-and we heard this from Senator Evans perhaps more clearly the other day-are something to be given high priority. In July this year, a Mr Peter Bazos of Elite Wood Product was convicted in the Sydney District Court on charges relating to the evasion of $294,000 worth of duty on imported tropical rainforest timber. In the course of giving evidence, Mr Bazos pointed out that at every single stage in the exploitation of that tropical rainforest timber-the cutting of it in the forest, the transportation of it in Malaysia, the cutting of that timber into flitches, its passage through the customs system and its export-bribery and corruption in Malaysia are involved. So what we are hearing from Senator Evans is that, for some peculiar and distorted reason dealing with the niceties of our relationship with the Malaysian Government, we should support an activity which of necessity, according to evidence given in court, involves Australians breaking the law in Malaysia. That is something that the Government needs to think about very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out in my speech at the second reading stage, we are indeed dealing with a very important subject. The Bill is a response to the alarming rate of destruction of the world's tropical rainforests. It is, as Senator Crowley has pointed out, but one element in a comprehensive strategy by which Australia could, and should, make a positive contribution to arresting this destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> I will read a few figures into the record. According to the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, some 142,200 square kilometres of rainforest were destroyed in 1989-a 90 per cent increase in the deforestation rate in only 10 years. The World Resources Institute puts the annual loss at nearly 200,000 square kilometres, resulting in the average loss, conservatively estimated, of 100 species per day. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared with all of these other issues, this is the issue: how many holes can we tear in the fabric of life-in the global biosphere? How many holes can we tear in it deliberately, wantonly, and without taking any action to prevent it, and still protect a living environment for our children and our grandchildren? The answer is that, frankly, we do not know and yet we arrogantly go on turning our backs on this very important issue. The European Commission estimated that:</PARA>
<PARA>At present rates of forest loss, all but a few of the remotest forest regions, mostly in the Amazon and Congo basins, could have disappeared by the early 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA>Today I asked a question of Senator Richardson regarding the fact that in 1986 the Australian Labor Party moved a motion with respect to this matter. It is now 1991 and we heard from Senator Evans the other day that, yes, the Party is considering it; it is giving it some priority. How long does that Party need before it takes some action against a process which will be complete in some 10 to 20 years? At that time further action will be quite unnecessary because there will not be any rainforest left. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Australian Democrats support comprehensive action. We support these other things that need to be done, many of which have been set out in my earlier speech, such as international debt relief for the poorest countries, and large increases in overseas aid. We have directed our attention to these issues, not by way of legislation because, as Senator Crowley would know, we cannot legislate in these areas; but we have directed attention to them in our alternative budgets, both last year and this year. There is a great deal of detail in those budgets. In our alternative budget we have directed a great deal more money to those areas than is allocated in the Government's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up the time of the Senate because it is quite clear the way the vote on this will go. But I cannot reiterate too strongly that, compared with many-in fact most if not all-of the issues that are dealt with in this chamber, the loss of the world's rich diversity of animal and plant species and the increasing rate of that loss, the massive destruction of indigenous cultures, and the loss of the knowledge of how to handle the environment in many different areas of the world which are contained within those cultures are losses which we should grapple with as a matter of great urgency. It is for those reasons that I strongly commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) 5 June is World Environment Day,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the current human-induced rate of species and habitat loss is greater than at any other time in the history of the earth, and that this cannot continue for very much longer without dramatic consequences for global ecological systems and human welfare, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) over the past 200 years, Australia's record with respect to habitat destruction and mammal extinction has been one of the poorest in the world, and that this is continuing at an alarming rate;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) recognises that the future of the world environment for centuries to come will be determined by people here on earth today, and particularly commends the efforts of one Australian, Dr John Wamsley, for his visionary efforts in the protection of Australia's endangered species; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) further commends Dr Wamsley for his outstanding effort in establishing Warrawong Sanctuary in the Adelaide Hills and also for the establishment of Yookamurra Sanctuary in the Mallee region of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This notice of motion was lodged in this place as one of a number of notices of motion for World Environment Day. It draws the Senate's attention to two particular issues: firstly, to the perilous state of many Australian native species, particularly mammals; and, secondly, to the outstanding work of Dr John Wamsley. </PARA>
<PARA> John Wamsley runs a wildlife sanctuary called Warrawong Sanctuary just outside Adelaide. As it turns out, he runs it so successfully that not only has he won a number of major tourism awards but also he has managed to make a considerable profit from it. He has put this profit into either Warrawong Sanctuary or Yookamurra Sanctuary, and will continue to reinvest in further endangered species projects. </PARA>
<PARA> John Wamsley's sanctuary is very different from other wildlife parks. Indeed, it is different from anything I have seen in either Australia or overseas. It is particularly different to those that are usually touted as tourist destinations. I stress three reasons as to why it is very different. Firstly, I refer to the layout. The animals are not penned up in small cages for people to file past on nicely cemented paths. The animals roam freely in revegetated areas around the sanctuary, in a reasonably natural state, left to their own devices. Visitors actually have to walk around the sanctuary to see the animals on their own terms, usually at night with a torch. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the endangered species breed there freely; there is no controlled program. Indeed, Dr Wamsley actually displays many endangered species which are totally unknown to the vast majority of Australians. He does this rather than show off the more popular species such as the koala; in fact, that is the type of display on which many other parks concentrate. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, and perhaps the most important reason that Dr Wamsley is very different, he does not in any way exploit the animals for profit to indulge himself. Instead, he uses the profits he generates to benefit Warrawong and now in order to establish the 1,100 hectare feral animal free Yookamurra Sanctuary. That is why he is so different from most other Australians. That is why he deserved special recognition on World Environment Day-and I hope he will get it today. This motion is about one man who is doing more than his fair share to protect Australia's heritage. I argue that the least this Parliament can do is to give formal recognition to his work. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three main reasons why Australians should protect their biodiversity and the species that make it up. Firstly, we have a moral obligation to share this planet with other creatures and to ensure that they survive for the benefit and future enjoyment of our children, our grandchildren and future generations. Secondly, it is environmentally sensible not to destroy the very processes on which mankind is dependent for its survival. Thirdly, we are the custodians of a natural heritage that is found nowhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government chose to oppose this motion when it was originally introduced, apparently because it believes that its research programs are the only way to save Australia's rare and endangered species and that people such as Dr Wamsley have no place in these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the magnitude of the actual problem. In just over 200 years, we have destroyed forever 20 mammals which occurred nowhere else on earth. That represents a loss, on average, of one mammal every 10 years. What is worse is that in 1991 we now have another 30 mammals, 15 birds and over 200 plants which are in grave danger of becoming extinct. Many people believe that these mammal extinctions mainly occurred in the 1800s; that by the early 1900s it had basically all occurred. That is not correct. Unfortunately, species extinction has been occurring since then and is more likely than ever to continue to occur because of inaction by the current Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a reputable research program and, indeed, has allocated more funds to it in its current Budget. But there is little or no practical action. The mammals of Australian deserts were once more numerous and diverse than previously believed. In the last few decades they have suffered huge and sudden losses. In the words of Dr Andrew Burbridge:</PARA>
<PARA>So severe has this decimation been, that it has no parallel in any other relatively undisturbed region on earth. </PARA>
<PARA>In South Australia-the home State of both myself and Dr Wamsley-we have the worst record of any State, in a country which has the worst record of any country, for the extinction of mammals. Of an original 105 species of mammals, two monotremes, 65 marsupials, 17 rodents, one eutherian carnivore and 20 bats, 28 species are now extinct in South Australia. That is more than a quarter. Lost forever are 25 marsupials, two rodents and one bat species: they are now gone altogether from everywhere, totally wiped off the face of the earth. Another 39 are endangered, rare or vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 60 per cent of our native mammals in South Australia are either extinct or under threat of extinction. We only need to lose one mammal in the next 10 years for us to retain the extinction rate that has, in the past, given us the worst mammal extinction rate of any society in the history of humans on this earth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an outrage that a nation whose high standard of living is dependent almost entirely on the natural environmental assets of this continent can have such little regard for its continued health and show such indifference to the plight of many unique native species which share this continent with us. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look specifically at John Wamsley's program. Wamsley's plan is based on the very simple observation that feral animals, particularly the cat and fox, are primary causes of the extinction of our native animals, especially mammals. It is implemented by a very simple solution-a fence. In 1991 the only guaranteed solution is to keep these animals apart-that is, the fox and the cat on one side and the native mammals and animals on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> To keep these feral animals out of native habitats, Dr Wamsley has constructed an ingenious fence. He proposes now to erect one at Yookamurra sanctuary-indeed, that one is now complete-and, hopefully, to move on to other sanctuaries. He is not able to fence all the land across this continent that is in urgent need of fencing. However, I do understand that he has now been called upon as a consultant to a project in Western Australia. The need for fencing is a lesson that has been hard learned in Australian biological circles. There have been a number of disastrous attempts at reintroducing native mammals into their former habitats; two in particular are the parma wallaby effort in New South Wales and the bilby story in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon I shall look at the parma wallaby reintroduction program. Seventeen years ago the parma wallaby was thought to be extinct in Australia. However, an isolated population-an introduced population-was found on an island off New Zealand and was brought back to Australia. An article in the Australian in July 1989 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It had taken 17 years of careful planning, selective breeding and intensive scientific study, but finally the dream was realised: last year-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>47 rare Parma wallabies were let out in an inaccessible gully in the Illawarra catchment area in NSW. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim was to reintroduce the tiny marsupials into the wild. Within eight weeks every one of them was dead-snapped in half by foxes. Those studying the Parma wallaby knew the foxes would be a problem. For six months they had laid poison baits and the fox problem in the area had been dramatically reduced. But for the foxes that were left, the Parma were such a delicacy that they completely ignored the baits until every wallaby had been stalked and killed. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we now have no other way in 1991 but to fence until other programs such as biological control are effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Warrawong-I shall just look at that area very briefly-was started in 1989 to demonstrate that the biggest problems our wildlife species face in Australia are the fox and the cat. Not only was this hypothesis proven, but it was also shown that fox and cat proof enclosures could be built and maintained relatively cheaply. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the success of Warrawong, in the mid-1980s Dr Wamsley purchased what is now Yookamurra sanctuary-1,100 hectares of land, 100 kilometres east of Adelaide. The property was virgin scrub land, except for minor areas which were either cut by woodcutters in the pre-war days or logged in the post-war period. Both of these smaller areas are now regrown mallee. </PARA>
<PARA> Mallee habitat once occupied one-fifth of the Australian continent. Most importantly, this particular piece of mallee has never been grazed. Therefore, it provides a unique and special opportunity to be restored to its former glory. No introduced hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle or goats have ever grazed that land and destroyed the very fragile thin layer of lichens that cover the ancient soil protecting it from erosion. Unlike the evolution of animals on other continents, native animals in Australia have evolved with soft, padded feet which do not destroy our delicate topsoils. </PARA>
<PARA> In late 1990 Yookamurra was fenced for its entire 14-kilometre perimeter with a fox, cat, rabbit, dog, goat and pig proof fence. This fence cost Dr Wamsley approximately half a million dollars. It is 1.8 metres high, incorporates a skirt to stop animals digging under it and it is electrified with five wires which are all powered using solar electricity. The property became a sanctuary when the last gate was closed in October 1990. This was done by Sir Mark Oliphant, the former Governor-General of South Australia. There was a ceremony held at that stage attended by a number of people, including politicians such as Dr John Coulter of the Australian Democrats and Peter Lewis, the Liberal member for the MurrayMallee. In closing the fence, Sir Mark stated:</PARA>
<PARA>South Australia, all Australia, the whole world, will be richer because of the existence of this great fauna reserve. </PARA>
<PARA>Through the late 1990s and early into 1991, an extensive program of feral animal eradication took place and was completed when the last rabbit was destroyed. All this was done from profits generated from Warrawong sanctuary and with support, but without one cent of monetary assistance, from State and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Yookamurra sanctuary has been completely funded from the earnings of Warrawong and from private investment. It owes no money to anyone. The main aim of Yookamurra is to reintroduce the animals which once lived there and to allow them to live in balance with as little human interference as possible. Eventually, like its predecessor in the Mount Lofty Ranges, it will be open to the public for education and research. It will show Australians what our country used to be like before its present near destruction, particularly by the feral animal invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The reintroduction of native animals is being supported with the cooperation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in South Australia. It has an approved management plan. All animals inside the sanctuary will remain the property of the Crown-and I must stress that. The management plan for Yookamurra sanctuary lists 26 mammals which used to live in the Murray-Mallee. Some are still common in South Australia: the hairy-nosed wombat, the echidna, the western grey kangaroo and the red kangaroo. Some are now rare in South Australia: the western pygmy-possum, the brush-tailed phascogale, the common dunnart, the southern brown bandicoot, Mitchell's hopping mouse and the plains rat. </PARA>
<PARA> Some are endangered in South Australia, including the feathertail glider and the greater stick-nest rat. The last group is extinct in South Australia but, fortunately, has survived elsewhere. It comprises the western quoll, the spotted-tail quoll, the eastern quoll, the red-tailed phascogale, the fat-tailed dunnart, the burrowing bettong, the brush-tailed bettong, the bridled nailtail wallaby, the numbat, the western barred bandicoot, the eastern barred bandicoot, the common ringtail possum, the common brushtail possum and the bilby. </PARA>
<PARA> Of these 26 original inhabitants, Dr Wamsley hopes to introduce at least 23 and would introduce others except that six are now extinct, not just in South Australia but extinct-gone forever more. They are the crescent nailtail wallaby, the pig-footed bandicoot, the white-footed rabbit-rat, the lesser stick-nest rat, the eastern hare-wallaby and the toolache wallaby. In addition to these mammals, it is also proposed to introduce bird species such as the southern stone curlew, the mallee fowl and the bustard, which no longer exist in the area because they are particularly susceptible to predation by foxes and cats. How many honourable senators could actually describe any of these animals? How many have ever heard of them?</PARA>
<PARA> Very soon honourable senators will have the opportunity to visit Yookamurra sanctuary. Thanks to several State governments which are cooperating with John Wamsley, the species acquisition program is now under way. In May 1991 the first animals were introduced. They were the very small native rodents known as pseudomys australis. They were released in the presence of the Australian Director of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Mr Don Henry. In July 1991 the second introduction occurred with the release of the brushtailed bettong from a population bred by the South Australian Museum. Numbers in the wild have decreased to about 200. This is the first time since early this century that these small marsupials have inhabited that land. They once ranged widely across the continent. I must add that they and many of the other browsing animals kept the risk of wildfire low because they grazed on the undergrowth. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Wamsley anticipates releasing mallee fowl, stone curlews, bustards, stick-nest rats and Mitchell's hopping mice within two months and plans to release red-tailed phascogales, burrowing bettongs, numbats, western barred bandicoots, western quoll, banded hare-wallabies, bilbies and bridled nailtail wallabies next year-that is, in 1992. Dr Wamsley's company, Earth Sanctuaries, spent over $1m on conservation projects in South Australia last year. This extraordinary series of projects has been implemented by an extraordinarily determined individual. Few people would have dared to take on such an unusual project on this vast scale. It is this vision and determination that have led to my motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators may not see any great merit in Dr Wamsley's acts, but I believe that history will remember this man fondly. I ask Government senators in particular how they can possibly object to a motion that congratulates the efforts of a committed individual. This motion does not in any way make specific criticisms of the Government. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, recently visited Warrawong. I am not sure if the former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, has-I know that a number of other senators, including Senator Olsen and Senator Coulter, have, as I have-visited Warrawong. Indeed, I understand that Senator Coulter has also visited Yookamurra. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see the passing of this motion today as the end of the story by any means. We now need to use the knowledge gained from what John Wamsley has done in other parts of Australia. He cannot do it all on his own. The valuable research that has already been done through the Government's endangered species project should now be put into positive action, should be translated into concrete efforts, because we cannot simply keep on researching. We will research the animals to death. We need now to take some positive steps: to select carefully, using all the research and information we have, at least two national parks or fauna reserves in every State and to begin immediately a fencing program. </PARA>
<PARA> The endangered species program of the Government has been increased, but I stress again that, as John Wamsley says, we have done enough research. We know that the primary problem is foxes and cats. I understand that in Tasmania feral dogs are a problem as well. I quote John Wamsley:</PARA>
<PARA>Governments find it easy to ``solve'' the problem by allocating research money. Research workers are happy to guarantee to solve the problem. This symbiotic relationship produces some remarkable results. In South Australia, $350,000 has been spent developing management plans for the Yellow-footed Rock-wallabies over the last twenty years. Not one cent has ever been spent on implementing one recommendation from any of these plans. </PARA>
<PARA>I urge the Government to support this motion today, to congratulate John Wamsley and to recognise his efforts and successes. I also urge the Government to now fund fencing programs for at least two national parks or fauna reserves in each State. John Wamsley is committed to saving species and he has shown others how to do it. I ask the Senate to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise-much as I did the last time I was on my feet, which was about half an hour ago-to say that we agree with the sentiments of the motion but that we are not going to support it. I will come to the detail of why we take that position in a moment. It is not to object to any of the words in the motion, going as it does to noting World Environment Day, its importance and the contribution of Dr John Wamsley. For the record, I am another South Australian senator who has visited Warrawong. I think Senator Lees knew that but thought that I would be unkind about Dr Wamsley, so she did not mention it. Senator Less is quite right: I am about to be a little unkind about Dr Wamsley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been to Warrawong. It is an absolutely ace place. I did not go at night with a torch. I went up there at 6 o'clock in the morning. One can watch bettongs head butting. They both arrived in the one place at the one time and knocked each other unconscious. They are very sweet, delightful little animals. They scurry and scuttle around in the black water pond that Dr Wamsley has established. In the same pond the platypuses swim around doing wheelies, back flips and other such creative things. </PARA>
<PARA> One also notes that Dr Wamsley encourages the animals to come out for us to see them by taking bits of wheat around in his hand. I am not quite sure where that fits in the natural scheme of things, but I was very happy to see the animals and I was very pleased to be up there. But, as I said to Senator Lees, we have to be fairly creative and brave to go to Warrawong because we have to listen to Dr Wamsley telling us about our faults and those of everybody else in the world, saying that we do not love furry creatures enough. We need to be strong to go to Warrawong and cop the abuse that Dr Wamsley gives us about issues in general. That is because Dr Wamsley believes in such issues passionately. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hate my remarks to be taken negatively against what he has done. His work is fantastic. It is an absolute delight to go to Warrawong. It is also fantastic to discover that on a quarter-acre block enough wood can be grown, if planted properly, to keep oneself in timber for the rest of one's life. We should just get those trees growing; plant them year by year; chop them down in a controlled way; and burn them in a slow combustion stove. Much can be learnt from Dr Wamsley and Warrawong. As I say, it is a delightful place to which to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Wamsley has a particular style of tackling the world that may discommode people. The vehemence and commitment of his words may set them right back in their chairs or push them into the next paddock. That is a pity because the message needs to be told very strongly. Maybe we have to be outrageous, fierce and very single minded, but the time has come for Dr Wamsley to know that his message is well enough understood, that his support in the community is large enough, for that vehemence and single mindedness not to be so much of a necessary characteristic. I do not mean that he should wander away from his message, but I do not believe that he needs to maintain his manner in order to persuade us. </PARA>
<PARA> I also understand that Dr Wamsley has been invited to assist with a project with the Pitjantjatjara people in far north South Australia. It is very much a dry lands area-much drier than Yookamurra. I am not sure whether that project is still in the planning stage or whether it will be implemented very soon. </PARA>
<PARA> The words that Senator Lees used to describe the difference between cloven-hoofed animals and the padded feet of animals of this country and the importance of those different designs of feet on our native vegetation reminded me of a chapter in a book I certainly commend to anybody in this place and to all Australians. The book is by Jill Ker Conway and is called The Road from Cooraine. It is an utterly delightful read. The first chapter in that book contains probably the most evocative description-it is a sympathetic and beautiful description-of the far western New South Wales country that I have ever read. In large part, it is very evocative of Australia in general, though it is focused on the country she knows best from growing up in far western New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a particularly tragic book, although not apropos of this motion. Jill Ker Conway eventually rose to take out the university medal in the University of Sydney. She applied to join the foreign service but in those days-not too long ago-they did not take women; they took men. So she left the shores of Australia and now lives in America. What a great lady; a wonderful writer of Australia. I commend the book to all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not supporting this motion because it suggests-Senator Lees touched on this-that the only person who is seriously addressing the problem of endangered species is Dr Wamsley. That is a very insufficient appreciation of the truth. Indeed, the Government has a very good record of commitment to assistance with endangered species. I think the motion is lacking in that it highlights the efforts of one and overlooks the efforts of, firstly, the Government and, secondly, many other people who have been so committed to contributing to the maintenance of our endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister launched the Commonwealth's endangered species program, curiously known as ESP, in 1989.  That 10-year program was given $2m in funding for each of the 1989-90 and 1990-91 financial years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The endangered species program does have an impressive record. It is funding programs which contribute to the conservation of a number of plants and animals in this country. Senator Lees suggested that our country has witnessed the extinction of more mammals than many other countries. I suggest caution in accepting that assessment. We are perhaps one of the few countries that at least knows the names of the lost species. I do not know how many mammals were wandering around in southern Europe circa 500BC, but I suggest that Australia is not the only country that has seen the extinction of mammals. What we do have, is a piece of history and an effort is being made to try to document that so that we know what has happened and what has been lost, and can try to prevent any further extinction of species if we possibly can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will list some of the things which show the breadth of conservation subjects covered by the endangered species program. It addresses such things as environmental weeds and feral animals; major research into fox control by CALM and CSIRO; action plans to identify conservation status and management priorities for birds, bats, rodents, fish, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates; a national education program to improve public support for recovery of endangered species and communities; and the preparation of recovery plans for more than 50 species. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing about the endangered species program which needs to be noted is its concern to involve the community at the grass roots level in education about national threatened species. It tries to ensure that, when a government or individuals raise the importance of endangered species and the threat of extinction, the community is aware, informed and sympathetic. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen mentioned earlier in here today the Landcare program and the importance of looking after soil in this country. We have seen some of the initiatives of Minister Peter Cook and our State colleagues over the last few years. I have to admit that we have taken a long time to realise the importance of caring for our land-our soil-as well as our plants and animals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that the Government is more than aware of, and is on the record as being fully involved in, saving endangered species. That work is dispersed around the country. I cannot insist that Dr Wamsley is the only person doing these things and that nobody else is. Within the zoos of Australia and within a number of the research institutions-the forest, soil conservation and plant conservation places-the species are not becoming extinct as they might have been if this work was not being done. </PARA>
<PARA> I utterly agree with Senator Lees about the significance of Dr Wamsley's work. One of the things that particularly struck me is the fence that he has constructed. I would be interested to see whether it does hold up against rabbits. I understand that he claims it does. I can see that it has worked very well in keeping out feral cats and foxes. The design of Dr Wamsley's fence is interesting. I think he is particularly interested in it and excited to draw it to people's attention when they visit the sanctuary. It is not an outrageously expensive construction. If it does work against rabbits, I think it will be as great a contribution in this area as the saving of a species. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that is particularly attractive is that Dr Wamsley has not only saved species-or at least released them into an environment that is acceptable to them-but also he has recreated, as much as he can, some of the original hill space in South Australia. That has its own attraction too; it is a very nice place to visit. When he first started to do that, and was cutting down trees that were non-native and not indigenous to that area, he had some very significant run-ins with the local community and, I believe, the Premier of the day, Don Dunstan. Through it all, Dr Wamsley has kept on with his project. I strongly endorse the sentiments of the motion that congratulate Dr Wamsley but the importance of the Government's contribution towards the protection of endangered species should not be overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons I have outlined, we will not be supporting this motion because it fails to acknowledge people other than Dr Wamsley working in this country, and their great contribution to addressing this difficult and frightening challenge that has been so well outlined by Senator Lees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is disposed to support Senator Lees's motion, not necessarily because we agree with the self flagellation in points (ii) and (iii) of note (a), but because we find that notes (b) and (c) merit support. We certainly feel that Dr Wamsley should be commended for his activities. It may well be that the opposition that we have heard from the Government today rests heavily on the fact that Dr Wamsley has managed to do all of his hard work without the support of the Government. That perhaps dramatises to the Government that there are various matters in which its incompetence can be a dead hand. The absence of that dead hand does, in fact, at times provide opportunities to people who are dedicated to performing very well indeed in an area where there is a tendency for Government support and help to be demanded on all occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether or not it is the view of the Government that Dr Wamsley is overcommitted, that his message is a bit raucous, overvehement and so on, to our mind-even if it is true-is of no consequence. The issue is whether or not Dr Wamsley has done a good job and whether his activities are for the net benefit of Australians. Nothing that we have heard from the Government today detracts from that. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, I am surprised to learn that the Government is not of a mind to support this motion, I understand on the grounds that perhaps Dr Wamsley is not a person the Government feels it wants to support in public. To my mind there was no other explanation, although in passing a point was made, which I must say I tend to agree with, about the earlier part of the motion. But as the thrust of the motion appears to relate to Dr Wamsley, I do not want to quibble about the earlier bits that, quite frankly, for those who like flagellation seem to be a bit of self-indulgence. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make a couple of points about the first bit of the motion. The assertions made are subjective. It is asserted that:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the current human-induced rate of species and habitat loss is greater than at any other time in the history of the earth, and that this cannot continue for very much longer without dramatic consequences for global ecological systems and human welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the real problems that that kind of assertion generates is a question about what has really changed. Has it been our capacity to measure change or has it been the change itself? It seems to me that in many instances our capacity to measure the change has improved immensely and, as a result, we are more concerned about the evident change. I find it very hard to accept that view, just as I find it very hard to accept the view in the third paragraph that Australia's record is one of the poorest in the world and is continuing at an alarming rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been under the impression that there was a much greater awareness and concern for these issues now that the methods of measurement have been dramatising to us what is happening. In passing, I would just say that the status quo is a concept that is basically unheard of in ecological development. There is no such thing as the status quo, and to revere it because it is the status quo seems to me to miss the whole point of evolution. That is by no means a justification for wiping out species. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am saying is that through the history of the world there has been change: some of it induced by rival species such as man, some induced by glaciers-some would say acts of God. I am quite happy that I do not face the prospect of meeting an unfriendly pterodactyl on the way home. I cannot pretend the absence of that pterodactyl has somehow destroyed my capacity to enjoy life or has done infinite damage to the world itself. </PARA>

<PARA> I have no great feeling of commitment to the status quo in ecology. I do not think anyone alive should be overwhelmed by the necessity to maintain the status quo. However, the extinction of a species is a matter of concern. I express some uneasiness about the way we tend to define some species as `good' species-not everyone, but there are some people who make value judgments between species, which I find rather quaint, when protecting one species from extermination by another species. </PARA>
<PARA> With the reservation that the Opposition is not terribly attracted to the early parts of this motion, we are supporting the motion because of the bottom part of it. We do not want to amend it because, frankly, it would become too complicated. As long as it is on the record that we are supporting the bottom part of the motion, that will do. I conclude simply by saying that I am intrigued by the Government's lack of support for the motion, but in view of the sort of bureaucratic advice the Government was given against a man who is not only a non-bureaucrat but also an anti-bureaucrat, I am not at all surprised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to make a couple of points. I am pleased the Opposition is supporting the motion moved by Senator Lees. I assume that it was the private nature of Dr Wamsley's conservation work which appealed so much to the Opposition. As Senator Lees pointed out, it is true that John Wamsley took over an old and run-down dairy farm and for a time tried to grow beef cattle. I happened to have a small farm not far from Dr Wamsley's. At the time when beef prices fell, he turned his mind to other things and developed the Warrawong Sanctuary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without a shadow of a doubt, Dr Wamsley has proved that protecting native animals from the onslaught of the introduced predator types which were not originally present in Australia, particularly the cat and the fox, will allow native animals to continue to evolve and to do their thing, as it were, into the indefinite future. Dr Wamsley accomplished that initially with his own sweat and tears by building the first fence around Warrawong. Then, through taking people through for a charge, he managed to build up a successful company and from that expanded into a much bigger venture at Yookamurra. The Opposition is quite right in supporting Dr Wamsley for those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to make a few other remarks in relation to what both Senator Michael Baume and Senator Crowley had to say. First of all, there is no doubt that statement (ii) under (a) is absolutely correct. The geological record shows that perhaps in the very distant past, perhaps at the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs, there was a mass extinction of species which was certainly not caused by humans because humans were not around at that time. We have some information from that geological record as to what in fact happened to life on earth at that time. It went through a very difficult time. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time, in more recent history-the last few hundred million years-the rate of species extinction has certainly been greater than at any time during that period. That is quite clear from the record. It is not a matter simply that we are better able to measure change because the change is there in the record. It can be seen in the rate of species loss and habitat loss, which are indeed enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume is also correct when he says we should not simply be attempting to preserve the status quo. Slow, ponderous evolution has gone on throughout 4,000 million years. There has been continuous change. It is the rate of change and its causation which is of concern now. Conservation has been defined as the attitude which causes humans to stand back from their intrusion into that evolutionary process to allow those ponderous processes of evolution to resume their course as they were before the interruption of those processes by humanity. That is what conservation is about. It does not mean that we attempt to freeze evolution in a moment of time. It means that we allow that slow and ponderous-and I stress those words-process of evolution to go on without the massive intrusion of human demands on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Baume pointed out, it is incredibly precious of Senator Crowley not to support this motion simply because it does not praise the Government. My God, if we were not to pass anything in this place because it did not praise the Government we would not get very far at the present time, especially in view of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, if we did not pass anything simply because it was not completely comprehensive and did not mention everything that might be in the remotest way related to the thing before us again, we would not pass very much. It is appropriate to put these words down and to speak of the human induced rate of species extinction, about which there is no doubt, and to commend Dr Wamsley for his work. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley mentioned that when one goes to Warrawong, Dr Wamsley may use some strong words about his concern for the extinction of many species of animals in Australia and about the failure not only of this Government but also of successive governments to do anything about it other than study the process while animals slowly became rarer and rarer and then disappear forever. </PARA>
<PARA> He is absolutely and entirely justified in abusing his fellow Australians for allowing that process to continue when they do not and have not done anything about it. He is entirely justified. Those of us who feel very deeply about the protection of Australia's indigenous and unique flora and fauna do not feel that as abuse. We entirely agree with Dr Wamsley. Those who have not done enough to protect that flora and fauna may feel abused. So they might, because they deserve to be abused. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley also mentioned, and she sought leave to table, the list of the research which has been done under the Hawke Government. She specifically mentioned the preparation of recovery plans for threatened species. That precisely is the point that Senator Lees made. We can have all the plans in the world. We can study species as they become rarer and rarer. We can know more and more about them until the last animal disappears. Unless, at the same time, we do something to save those species so that they remain around for future generations and for their own ongoing evolution then all the studies in the world come to nought. They will be stuffed specimens in a museum slowly moulding away, and by another two or three generations even those will have gone. </PARA>
<PARA> Important as the research is, it is not saving species, and that is the essential contribution which Dr Wamsley has made. He has shown conclusively that, at the very least with respect to those species that he has at Warrawong, by fencing an area against the intrusion of feral predatory animals, especially the fox and the cat, one can re-introduce native animals to an area from which they have been extinct for a long time. One can have them flourish, breed and perform exactly as they were before European human beings came to Australia 200 years ago. That demonstration is extremely valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a couple of weeks ago I saw a television program which dealt with one of the large national parks in the Broken Hill region. It dealt with the plight of the yellow footed rock wallaby and mentioned that area was absolutely infested with goats. The program said that in the previous five months 14,000 goats had been shot using rifles mounted in helicopters. Yet at the time the film was shot there were still 14,000 goats there. </PARA>
<PARA> There remained in that national park-a national park set aside largely to protect the yellow footed rock wallaby-some 40 yellow footed rock wallabies compared with 14,000 goats. Surely, with the ongoing attempt to control the goat problem by shooting-which clearly had to be repeated over and over again, and we were still not protecting the very species for which the park had been set aside-we should be looking to the sort of solution that Dr Wamsley has demonstrated works. We should be looking to fence those areas off against goats, excluding them altogether so there would be an area where the yellow footed rock wallaby was not competing with an animal which was totally destroying its habitat. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased that the Opposition supports the motion. I am deeply disappointed that the Government finds itself so precious, so hurt, that somebody else might be doing something effective in wildlife protection that it feels itself unable to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the motion. A week is a long time in politics. It is certainly a long time considering what has happened in the Soviet Union since I almost completed my speech on the motion last week. It is interesting to note that some of the commentators are now talking-and even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has hinted-of recognising the Baltic states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel most strongly that we should recognise Croatia and Slovenia. When I say that, I do so for a very good reason. Australia could take the lead-and hopefully other countries would fall in behind us-to condemn these Serbian communists who at this point in time seem to be causing most of the trouble and the deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> When I last spoke on the motion I quoted from a press clipping which said that more than 300 people had been killed in Croatia. I repeat: from the information I have received, I believe that the figure could be as much as 10 times higher. When I last spoke, AAP issued a press article which noted that Croatian exiles-some from Australia-were taking part in a frantic effort to train the Croatian defence force. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA> `The best way to stop the war is to recognise Croatian independence,' said Joe, who returned to Trstenik from the United States to help train a national guard force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government, I wish to support the terms of this motion. It captures the sentiment that we all feel about the very unhappy situation in Yugoslavia, and expresses in a positive way-which we in the Government accept-the need for us to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement, which will avoid conflict and meet the aspirations of the constituent units of the republic for independence. Those aspirations are real; they have been manifested by democratic process and should be respected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a difficulty in terms of the international community in general, or Australia in particular, in moving from that set of perceptions to a ready acknowledgment or recognition of statehood. There are criteria that need to be satisfied, which I spelt out in detail in answer to a question by Senator Harradine the other day, before countries externally can confidently go down the path of recognition without getting caught up in terrible inconsistencies in the way in which we deal with these situations generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The criterion in particular of all of them that matters most is that of demonstrable control of the territory in question by the entity in question. The big difficulty so far as Croatia is concerned is in demonstrating in present circumstances that degree of control. Accordingly, it is a situation that cries out for a negotiated peaceful solution, one that will satisfy the aspirations of the people in the way that the international community can respond to. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some grounds for optimism that a peaceful solution might be possible. A meeting between the federal collective presidency and the presidents of the six Yugoslav republics was held on 20 August, a couple of days ago, to try to reinstitute the cease-fire. That meeting succeeded in agreeing a four-point plan involving recognition of the right of every people to self-determination, including cessation; secondly, respect for the democratically expressed will of all peoples; thirdly, equal treatment of all political options without the use of force; and, finally, legal implementation of the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is, as we all know, that the recent trend of events in Yugoslavia has, unfortunately, seen the action on the ground pursued, regardless of the various political arrangements and promises that have been made or put in place. Press reports this morning indicate that fighting is, regrettably, still continuing and that the Yugoslav national army has been accused of taking sides in the conflict and supporting Serbian irregular forces in their capture of Croatian territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Community has faced up to its responsibility to take the leading role in bringing the Yugoslav parties to the negotiating table. The Australian Government lends its full support to these efforts, including the efforts to implement the Brioni agreement, which was broken by the EC on 7 July. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to renew the call of the Australian Government to all the Yugoslav parties to heed the lessons of the failed coup in Moscow, and to show the courage and leadership that are necessary to resolve the crisis in their country by peaceful means. </PARA>
<PARA> I am instructing the Australian Ambassador in Belgrade to bring this call to the attention of the federal and republican leaders in Yugoslavia. I can repeat the undertaking that has been previously given that once Croatia and Slovenia meet the criteria for statehood under international law Australia will be among the first to extend recognition to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully sympathise, as does the Australian Government, with the anxiety that many Australians with links to Yugoslavia are feeling at this time. I take this opportunity again to ask them to continue the commendable restraint that they have shown thus far. </PARA>

As the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill, said on the last occasion on which this matter was discussed, this motion is the result of discussions that took place with a number of senators, including myself. I believe that in all its elements it is a worthwhile motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The violence, loss of life and destruction of property in Slovenia and Croatia-particularly in Croatia-are still continuing. As the motion says, this is largely as a result of the attacks by terrorists supplied by the communist-led federal army and attacks by the army itself. Freedom loving people, people who by democratic will have expressed their desire for independence, deserve to be supported by independently minded and democratic people such as Australians and the Australian Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to rehearse many of the events that have taken place, but time does not permit me to do so. Suffice it to say that I have just come from a meeting of parliamentarians for Croatia and Slovenia, which was convened by Mr Paul Filing, the Federal member for Moore. I had the honour of being elected Vice-President of that body, the President being Dr Theophanous. Therefore, there is a broad range of opinion that is supporting the democratically expressed determination of the peoples of Slovenia and Croatia. I commend this motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two directions that this country can take: either it can continue to drift under Labor or it can embrace the program of radical reform which we offer. We recognise that it is never easy to face up to major change but, in our view, at the present time there is no choice. Labor is now locked in. The Keating challenge and the pre-eminence of the Left leave the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) totally shackled. But even he has abandoned any semblance of significant reform. Clearly, the Labor Party is only interested in attacking us and trying to build an atmosphere of fear-fear of change. What a tragedy that must be for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal tonight with one aspect of our reform program and that is tax reform. I will put it in context, because we offer many others-labour market reform, reform of protection policies, privatisation, infrastructure improvement and others. All of those reforms are designed to contribute to building a more competitive, outward looking economy. That is the key to rebuilding Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> To embrace our package will be a challenge for all Australians. It might have been easier to allow government simply to fall into our lap. In fact, some commentators have suggested that that is what we should have done. But that would be abdicating our responsibility to enunciate a better alternative and, in government, to be prepared to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians will be prepared to accept our challenge. They are indicating it in the polls. There is now a 16.5 per cent gap between the two alternative governments. People know that Australia must now radically change. It is a hard, cruel, competitive world out there. Australia can no longer insulate or isolate itself from it. We must compete within it. The Government must ensure that the wealth creators in our society are not inhibited by outdated structures. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good saying that our wharves are more efficient than they were last year. The question is whether our wharves are more efficient than those with which we compete. That is what this Government does not face up to. The cost of this drift, as demonstrated in this Budget, is misery to the hundreds of thousands of Australians who are now out of work. They are out of work, make no mistake, because of the appalling economic judgments of the Hawke-Keating Government. They were warned of the consequences of high interest rates. For months they were warned of high interest rates crushing Australian business, but they refused to listen. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did they refuse to listen? They refused to listen because they had no alternative. They were locked in by vested interests. They were locked into the accord by the union movement. There were no other alternatives for them to take. They were not able to make the major structural changes that are necessary for this country. They had no alternative but to stick with cripplingly high interest rates for far too long and we all now know the consequences of that. </PARA>
<PARA> For the same reason, the Government still cannot act. That was demonstrated yet again in this Budget. It was a Budget that gave no hope. I suggest that the Government lost the right to say again, `Trust us, it will all work out'. It is what government members have been saying over the last few days. We have heard it in this chamber- `It will work out; there will be a recovery'. Australians no longer believe it. There is 28 per cent youth unemployment in this country. What a disgrace. What will the figure be next year? The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) does not know. All we know is that it will be higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Could there be a greater indictment of a government than to have somewhere between a quarter and a third of its young people out of work? We were told today that 770,000 would be the average number of people on unemployment benefits in this country next year. How appalling. What is it expected to go up to? Over 900,000. What is the real unemployment rate? Those who are on unemployment benefits or the alternative to unemployment benefits probably account for well over one million people. There are a million people out of work in this country because this Government got it wrong. The government of the worker, its members say to us. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we get from this Budget? We get a Budget which is uninspiring, unimaginative and which has no solution. The Left is upset. Business is appalled. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) is already, interestingly, distancing himself from the Budget, the parameters of which had been set before he came into the job. That is not leadership. A family allowance supplement package does not give jobs back to people. It gives only temporary relief to arrest the poverty created by Labor in the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> In his address, the Treasurer referred to last year as `a disappointing year for all Australians; a year of lost jobs, squeezed profits and dashed hopes'. When I first read that I could not believe it. I re-read it. Mr Kerin in his Budget Speech described last year as `a disappointing year for all Australians; a year of lost jobs, squeezed profits and dashed hopes'. That is the view of this Government. The Treasurer is right; he is dead right. What he did not say was that, with his Budget, the position would get worse. It was a presentation of a Budget that was designed to anticipate greater misery for the millions of Australians who are directly or indirectly suffering as a result of this Government's incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget needed to deliver many things and it failed on all counts. The Australian economy should show vitality and strength. There is no reason why it should not. But where are the measures to restore the vitality that has been decimated in the last eight years? Economic growth must be boosted and our international competitiveness enhanced. But the Government has not initiated any process to address these shortcomings in its current policies. Quite the contrary. What will be the cost to jobs when the Lodge initiated compulsory superannuation deal flows through? What government in its right mind, in the deepest recession that this country has faced since the 1930s, would apply this extra impost to employment? Only a government which is required to do so by a union movement. What does that say about today's union movement? It says that the union movement has abdicated its responsibility to the workers as well. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to see more Australians with superannuation. We would like to see more workers with the capacity to save for their retirement. We would like to see more employers able to contribute to their workers' superannuation. But in a deep recession, to apply a formula in which one person's superannuation may well be the last straw that breaks another person's job is unbelievable, and this from a Labor government which claims to be the workers' government. No wonder that the Left is mad. If Senator Bolkus and his colleagues from the Left spent more time looking after the workers' interests rather than trying to abolish basic freedoms, we would all be better off. </PARA>
<PARA> There we are. We have a Budget that will not restore business investment or jobs; a Budget deficit that is likely to be well over the $4.7 billion predicted; and a Budget which sees Labor again ripping off ordinary Australians' savings. What did we hear from the previous Treasurer about ripping off the savings of ordinary Australians? Here it is again-a Budget which offers no relief to the near record high real interest rates, so often forgotten by this Government. Those interest rates are still at a near record high level. What a dismal effort. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of tax reform, because what people will always find from the coalition on this side of the chamber is a well-thought through, constructive alternative. I will explain why tax reform is so critical to the economic recovery of Australia. Perhaps if this Government had grasped the nettle on reform years ago Australia would not be paying such a high price now. </PARA>
<PARA> A tax system that is manifestly inefficient, unfair and inequitable condemns this nation to second-rate status. Australia finds itself in the position of being one of only two OECD nations that have a wholesale sales tax. Switzerland, which is one of the two, also has a retail sales tax. It means that, unlike our competitors, we are afflicted with a wholesale sales tax levied indiscriminately at three different rates-10, 20 and 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last two decades, 18 OECD countries have moved towards some form of broad-based consumption tax. They have done it because they could see that they can produce a better, more competitive taxation system as a result. In total, 21 of the 23 OECD economies have a goods and services tax. As I said, the resulting tax mix for those countries means less reliance on income tax and a more efficient, simple rationalisation of the indirect tax base. Labor knows it, and it knew it in 1985. The difference is that it was not prepared to do it and it is still not prepared to do it. It is not a satisfactory response for Australia merely to broaden its existing wholesale sales tax base. The result would only be a more complicated, haphazard confusion which would impact adversely on both the consumer and business. The current tax mix in Australia comprises a high level of income tax which, combined with the effects of inflation, has led many taxpayers to be pushed into high tax brackets. Any incentive to work more and earn more is then crushed by the application of those high marginal tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Our existing wholesale sales tax system was designed over 50 years ago in a totally different world. Moreover, it was designed and intended to apply only to luxury items. Yet this Government, having made only minor alterations, purports that it is a satisfactory method of taxation in today's world. Its inequitable application means that currently 20 per cent wholesale sales tax is paid on items such as toothpaste and deodorant but that there is no wholesale sales tax on antiques, artworks or imported clothes. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the justification for this approach in the well-earned tests of tax such as equity, simplicity and efficiency? It fails on all counts. The wholesale sales tax raised $3.5 billion in 1982-83, a take that has now increased to over $10.7 billion in 1990-91. Ironically, it is the same level that we estimate may well be the Budget deficit. There has been an increase in sales tax receipts in real terms of 53 per cent per adult since this Government came to power. It is a system which is inefficient, expensive and complex to administer and which delivers no benefits to our taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, however, the wholesale sales tax is a concealed, obscure, indirect tax of which the consumer is often unaware. It is a clear example of tax by stealth, which the coalition will abolish completely. That abolition will be in favour of tax reform which, with income tax reductions and cuts in government spending, will impose a single rate, broad-based goods and services tax which is clearly visible to the consumer, taxing goods and services equally. Consumers will know for the first time what tax they are paying and at what rate, and they will know the cost price on which it is applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken before, and again tonight, of the need for Australia to be internationally competitive. As the situation stands currently, inputs into our export products are subject to this hidden tax. This represents a cost of about $1 billion a year to exporters. In the current international market, exporters cannot pass on the costs of that burden. The coalition's tax reforms will ensure that exports are zero rated, with any goods and services tax paid on inputs being fully rebated. </PARA>
<PARA> The wholesale sales tax also fails in another important area: it does not catch tax cheats and does not include transactions in the black economy. Individuals who persist in operating within the black economy under our alternative will not be able to avoid paying tax on their purchases of goods and services with that black cash. It is time that this country realised that the average taxpayer should not have to foot the bill for tax avoiders and black marketeers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been spreading misinformation about this proposal, particularly as to how it might affect low and mixed income earners. We are prepared to face those arguments. We want to debate the issue and we want it on the table, because Australians will realise that, as part of a tax reform package, it is in their best interests. It is not correct to say, for example, that superannuants cannot be compensated for a goods and services tax. Pensioners, full or part, can have any additional costs offset through an increase in the pension. Those on full super who do not receive the pension and still pay some income tax and the Medicare levy will benefit as income tax rates are adjusted to take into account the introduction of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing the need for reform of the tax system, the coalition is acknowledging the current inequities that have imposed an unfair burden on many taxpayers for too long. Our package will ensure that families with children receive significant benefits from income tax cuts, thus providing greater spending power. Those families who have a fixed income, such as those relying on a pension or other type of benefit, will have any additional costs offset through the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement with a goods and services tax will also serve other groups of Australians. Rural Australians are so often forgotten by this particular Government. I expect we will hear much more about them from my colleague Senator Boswell later tonight. Residents of rural Australia who struggle under the policies of this Government will benefit. In addition to the abolition of sales tax on their purchases, farmers who make a massive contribution to our export sector will gain from the coalition's proposal that all exports be zero rated. The GST that they pay on inputs to export products will also be refunded. This will be particularly important with regard to fuel costs, which present such a high cost to the farming community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also well recognised that one of our most important industries, tourism, provides free use of many of our facilities and services and untaxed goods to international tourists. The WST does not have a major impact on this sector; there is not a lot of wholesale sales tax paid in this sector. The application of a goods and services tax would mean that foreign tourists would contribute to the maintenance of the services they enjoy in Australia. We do not see anything wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also briefly to refer to the public support that is being received for tax reform in Australia because it is demonstrating a lesson to this Government, which is too afraid to act in this important area. Last week a committee of prominent dedicated Australians launched an organisation called Australians for Tax Reform. There is in the community, and it shows, a serious realisation that this nation cannot continue to ignore the need for an economy which is strong and vital, industry which is internationally competitive and a growing economy which will not tolerate the spectre of unemployment at the level of 10.5 per cent. The statement of the committee in launching its organisation was a telling one:</PARA>
<PARA>Australians for Tax Reform is a group of leading Australians in their fields who come from a range of backgrounds but have a common belief-that Australia's tax system should be reformed to become fairer, more efficient and more competitive with tax systems in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA>It is timely indeed to raise again this reform in light of the Government having presented to the people of Australia a nothing Budget: one designed to get it through the next few weeks; it is not one for the next decade. It is now clear to all that this is a government bereft of leadership and vision. This Budget should have faced the difficult major reform decisions and, particularly, it should have recognised the need for the fundamental reform of our taxation system. A broad based goods and services tax, cuts in personal income tax, and the abolition of the wholesale sales tax will be, when they are introduced by us, major steps towards achieving that goal. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that never before has the contrast been so clear: a do nothing government more concerned with its own survival; or an alternative government which will take the obvious, but hard, decisions which will give real hope to Australians for the future. Whether it is Mr Hawke or Mr Keating, it is the same. They have both failed Australia and the sooner they are gone the better.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1991 Budget has been brought down by a tired government: a government that has run out of vision; a government that is bereft of ideas; and one that is slowly ebbing out of office. After the Government had bludgeoned one million people onto the dole queues and thus reduced inflation, this Budget should have provided a golden opportunity to encourage investment and incentive. But instead the Government has chosen to recognise the productive sectors of the economy by hitting them with further costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In times when the Government is predicting unemployment at 10 3/4 per cent, these extra costs to the productive sector can only see more jobs being lost. What sort of Labor Government is it that actually budgets for more than one million unemployed people? It is a disgraceful government that would even contemplate such a figure. It is no wonder that every Labor Premier in Australia has turned his or her back on this Government and walked away from it as though it were well and truly on the nose. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures presented by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) only confirm that the Australian economy is truly in a desperate state. The Budget has now gone into deficit. The official Government figure is $4.7 billion. In reality, the actual Budget deficit is close to $10.7 billion, when the real factors of asset sales, debt transfers to the States, superannuation transfers and dividend increases from the Commonwealth and Reserve banks are taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Budget outlays are up by 2.6 per cent in real terms, taxation revenue is down 2.1 per cent, and Commonwealth spending is up 4.9 per cent. The Treasurer has predicted an economic recovery in the second half of this year, but I really believe Senator Walsh's statement that `Only a fool or a fraud would try to predict the timing of an economic recovery'. Senator Walsh did not want to have a bar of this Government and that is why he refused to serve on the front bench. He knew that this Government was finished and he did not want to be in the ship when it went down. </PARA>
<PARA> Based on the current economic climate, can we have any faith that the prediction of a $4.7 billion deficit will not go the way of last year's predictions-the $9 billion surplus which fell to a $1.8 billion surplus? Australia desperately needed a Budget that would return confidence in the future and lead to increased investment. Instead, business has been targeted for a new tax in order to pay for a Government promise on superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ministers cannot take it; they have just run away. The ACTU was not happy with the last national wage case, disagreeing with accord mark VI which granted an extra 3 per cent superannuation, taking it to 6 per cent. In the last few months we have seen the ACTU trying to get around the umpire's decision, which it did not like. With the Government's help, it got the accord mark VI benefit of a further 3 per cent superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now the Government has gone the whole hog and handed it back to the ACTU on a plate, with the backing of legislation. If only some of the genuine needs of the productive sector, the business sector and the farming sector, could be given the same amount of ear time as the ACTU. It is certainly the body preferred by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business received nothing from this Budget-that is, nothing except the extra costs of compulsory superannuation. The legislated superannuation will be a big burden on small business, not only in the cost of an extra 3 per cent that has to be found, but also administration will be time consuming by nature of the employees-many being transient, part time or casual. This represents an extra burden in difficult times. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaking the Budget has become the Government's practice. Small business was given the impression and the expectation that a capital gains tax roll-over would be provided by this Budget. Small business needs this relief of retaining its capital in order to expand and develop. Yet this was not forthcoming. Its expectations were rocked. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, during the term of the Hawke Government, labour costs for small business have increased enormously. Overall high interest rate policies have crippled many businesses, but under the Hawke Government labour costs have increased in the vicinity of 25 per cent between the mark IV and the mark V accord. New taxes on business have been introduced which have all imposed costs at a time when businesses are struggling through the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> The series of accord agreements negotiated between the ACTU and the Government have seen the introduction of many new costs. There has been the training guarantee levy, increased costs associated with the 38-hour week, superannuation, costs arising from award restructuring, paternity and maternity leave, annual leave, sick and travelling leave, and the new apprenticeship fees. As former Whitlam Government Minister Frank Crean once said, `One man's pay rise is another man's job'.

<PARA> In the Budget special consideration has been given to the farmer in relation to the new assets test of $600,000 for the family allowance.

This does not help very many people at all. This does not help the farmers who continue to battle on on the land, nor their children who are being deprived of the right to an education because they are asset rich and income desperate.</PARA>

This is an increase of 34 per cent. Such a service is the meat inspection service paid for by the beef industry. From 1 January this year, the beef industry has been required to pay 100 per cent of its meat inspection services. In just one year, this has imposed an extra cost of $71m on the industry. In one year, the costs have gone from $33m to $104m. At the same time, Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service charges are $67,000 for each inspector. This is an example of much needed efficiency reforms that the Government refuses to address. Primary industry is burdened with such inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the plight of persons living in rural Australia and what they will get from the Budget. Like all Australians, there is the increase in Medicare payments to $3.50, rising to $5 by November next year. If their children are fortunate enough to be receiving a tertiary education, there is the increase of $144 a year, taking the higher education contribution to $2,250. </PARA>
<PARA> Roads, which are vital to rural communities, have had a funding cut of 22 per cent in real terms. Superannuation payments of 3 per cent to 5 per cent will have to be paid to all employees and to all processing industries, and will flow through to the farmer. </PARA>
<PARA> The relief provided by Austudy and the isolated children's scheme will assist only those on the way out of the industry or those on a pension. At the same time, the debt ridden farmer will not be getting any reduction in interest rates on any long term basis. Government spending has been increased for dubious reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The environment budget has increased by 30 per cent. A national conservation protection agency is to be set up. We are to give $20m to international environmental assistance. Cities are to receive $56m this year and $860m over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has given undue attention to the two vital sectors of his support base: the Greens and the Left. At the same time, the Government is happy to impose on rural industries policies such as 100 per cent cost recovery on inspection charges and to hinder their efficiency because reform in transport and on the waterfront is taking place at a snail's pace. </PARA>
<PARA> Many industries are at crisis point. The background to this year is a decline in crop prices of 14.9 per cent and livestock prices of 11.8 per cent. According to the latest ABARE figures, prices for wheat declined by 33.6 per cent, barley by 24 per cent, sugar by 9.2 per cent and vegetables by 27.7 per cent. Similarly, with livestock, prices for wool fell by 27.5 per cent, sheep by 65 per cent, milk by 12.8 per cent, sheep for export by 41.5 per cent and cattle by 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this, the agricultural sector still contributes a massive amount to this economy and it prevents the bottom falling out of the Australian economy. Under all of these difficult circumstances, the agricultural sector has boosted productivity by nearly 9 per cent and increased export volumes, despite a contracting international market and prices and the corruption of world commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Prices paid to farmers last year rose by only 0.9 per cent, the lowest since 1969-70. For example, the point has been reached where vegetable growers selling their produce on the domestic market are often sent a bill rather than a cheque. In turn, our processors are suffering and the existence of some of the value adding industries, such as the pineapple and vegetable processors, are under the very threat of survival from the flood of highly subsidised imports. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases, the importer is getting the advantage of cheap labour costs and is really a multinational company relocated in Asia solely for the purpose of the cheap production costs. To make matters worse, it receives a 5 per cent tariff reduction on goods coming into Australia on developing country preference. </PARA>
<PARA> In other cases, the massive subsidies in the EEC and the United States are destroying our rural industries. We have had the recent example of the Saudi wheat imported into New Zealand receiving a subsidy of between $600 and $1,000 a tonne, where our growers are netting something like $68 a tonne. Reforms to the common agricultural policy in the European Community will still result in an increase in the subsidy bill by $5.5 billion from this year's level to $58 billion in 1997. This is the trading situation that Australian farmers now face, both domestically and internationally. Our efficient farmers can only compete if their costs are reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget does not address reducing these costs and reforming input costs which are the real factors causing inefficiencies. The Budget has not addressed the real issues that need to be dealt with immediately. Our massive foreign debt of $170 billion and current account deficit of $15 billion can be reined in only if our export industries are boosted and not burdened. Reform in transport, handling, shipping and the waterfront must occur immediately, not over a multi-year program. This Government must stop imposing more costs on all business because it has to dance to the tune of the ACTU and the Green movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget is a disappointment. Not only was it a lost opportunity to alleviate costs on our productive sector, but it was shamefully used to impose further crippling costs on business and our productive sectors and it can only add to our appalling level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is not a people's Budget in that it does not provide opportunities for investment, growth and employment. Instead, it limits the hope and chances of all Australians and denies all Australians the hope and chance to get in there and to do their bit to lift Australia's performance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a degree of sadness that the Australian Democrats respond to the Government's 1991-92 Budget. On the announcement of the appointment of Mr Kerin to the office of Treasurer, I issued a statement saying that this was an opportunity for the Government to change direction in economic policy. Indeed, Mr Kerin made some statements which indicated he was prepared to intervene in this economy to boost employment; however, this Budget proves that this was a forlorn hope. It is a Budget of no hope for 28.5 per cent-more than one in four-of our young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review led with the headline `Budget 1991: Conservative parcel with a jobless sting'. There is no doubt that the statement is absolutely accurate. The appalling feature of the community's response to the Budget is that we are so used to the Labor Government implementing coalition policies that the news is greeted with little more than embarrassed resignation by Caucus members. </PARA>
<PARA> I was, therefore, heartened by reports that the more independent members of the supposed Labor Government are beginning to speak out against the `appease the market' philosophy which still dominates the policy formulation of the Budget process. I was pleased to hear Mr Langmore today speaking openly of the need for a subsequent mini-Budget to address properly the scandal of continued high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats completely agree with those sentiments, particularly since Mr Kerin was compelled to deliver what must be largely a Keating Budget. How can an estimated rate of unemployment of 10.5 per cent be tolerated in the Government's major economic statement of the year? At what level of unemployment will the Government change its stated policy of reducing inflation first, no matter what the social cost? Indeed, what is the role of the Government if it is not to attempt to change an economic direction which is bringing misery to millions of Australians, particularly since a large amount of the current unemployment has been intentionally engineered by the Government?</PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to consider the economic climate which is predicted for the current financial year. The outlook cannot be described as anything other than bleak. For the last year we have had various Ministers proclaiming the myth that recovery is just around the corner. However, every few months the commencement of that recovery suffers a delay. The increase in unemployment which will peak at a full percentage point above the current level in this year shows how hollow that prediction is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government predicts a total collapse in private investment in the current year, yet it refuses to increase public investment to fill the gap. General business investment is predicted to decline by 10.5 per cent, non-dwelling construction by 15.25 per cent and plant and equipment by 8 per cent. This can hardly be termed economic recovery. If it were not for a 5 per cent increase in private dwelling investment, the total predicted reduction of 6 per cent in private investment would be even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Further bad news awaits when one examines the expected household savings behaviour this year. The annual rate is predicted to fall further than in 1990-91. This, of course, means that the fall in investment will not even flow through into a substantial reduction in the current account deficit. Prior to the golden age of deregulation and free market ideology, this type of economic outlook would have been met with shame and it would have led to an increase in outlays to attempt to reduce the suffering. But, instead, the Budget Speech informs us:</PARA>
<PARA>As a share of the economy, outlays will be slightly higher than last year, but this increase is more than accounted for by the increase in outlays associated with the slowdown in economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA>In the worst recession in 60 years, which Mr Kerin, perhaps ominously, referred to as a depression, we have the Treasurer announcing a steady-as-she-goes policy in relation to outlays. This is a disgrace-particularly since we are aware of the creative accounting used to reduce outlays, especially the devolution of State debt financing. Clearly, the dominant economic philosophy in the Treasury is that public spending is always too high, even in times of economic catastrophe. The Australian Democrats completely reject this ideologically driven position. </PARA>
<PARA> Before examining the spending proposals announced by Mr Kerin, another aspect of the Budget which must be viewed with cynicism is the level of dividends and income being derived from the government financial institutions; that is, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank. At the time of the rescue of the State Bank of Victoria by its incorporation into the Commonwealth Bank, the Democrats suggested that no private equity was necessary because the funds-some $1.6 billion-could be found by a combination of, firstly, the surplus which was returned to the Commonwealth Bank from the Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation; secondly, the dividend from the 1991 earnings of the Commonwealth Bank; and, thirdly, transfers from the hollow log reserves of the Reserve Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time, we were told that such a proposition was ridiculous. In this Budget the Commonwealth expects that it will receive a total of $450m from the Commonwealth Bank this year and over $1.5 billion in earnings from the Reserve Bank. Clearly, the State Bank could have been bought without privatising the Commonwealth Bank. This course of action was not only possible but also entirely feasible and proves yet again that the real motivation for the partial privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank was to ensure that the other parts of the deregulation agenda-Australian Airlines, Qantas, ANL, Telecom Australia and others-were passed through the Australian Labor Party organisation with as little trouble as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to social security, community services and health. This Budget does very little for those Australians who have been most affected by the recession. It is a niggardly Budget: it gives a little with one hand and takes a lot with the other and, in the end, those people who have borne the brunt of the recession come out of this Budget with no improvement in their situation. I will cover only a few of the key issues, but I am sure that my colleague Senator Lees will be picking up on these and many other issues during the weeks to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Opposition senators had great fun with their claims that the family allowance expenditure in the Democrats' alternative budget had been understated by $2 billion. As Senator Lees has now put on the public record, the mistake was one of wording: weekly should have been fortnightly, the basis on which the figures were computed having been correctly computed. This paltry exercise shows up the Opposition's desperate attempts to cover up its lack of any credible alternative; in fact, any alternative at all-any measures, any figures, not even on its regressive and already discredited consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Medicare. The Australian Democrats will be opposing the introduction of a patient charge for bulk billed medical services. The proposed charge of $3.50 which will increase to $5 in November 1992 represents a serious retreat from the principle of universal health care and it will not be welcomed by the 70 per cent of Australians who support and approve of the universal character of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> The fee ignores the findings of the recent report of the Government's own national health strategy, which concluded that charges were `unlikely to play a significant role in solving any of the major problems facing the health sector'. Make no mistake, Madam Acting Deputy President: this fee marks the first nail in the Medicare coffin. It demonstrates this Government's inability to understand that Medicare is not about welfare; rather, it is an effective means of containing medical costs and delivering a good standard of health care to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been trumpeting that it has done something for farming families, but that package is mere tokenism. The three so-called hardship measures the Government is trumpeting will benefit very few families. In essence, the Government is saying to farmers, `If you are a farming family earning $14,000 a year, you are not poor'. The Government has failed to come to grips with the fact that land and tools of trade assets are virtually worthless unless they are realisable or are generating an income. The plight of farmers will not be alleviated unless and until the valuation of their assets is changed to a realistic basis that entitles them to the assistance they should get. Even then, it will be a fraction of what French and German farmers receive from their governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of social security, one can only say that if we had not been through a year of slash and burn in the social security budget we might be able to say that this Budget contained some small goodies. There is to be an increase in the family allowance supplement threshold from next April of $2.15 per week in child disability allowances; there are reforms in child-related payments to pensioners and beneficiaries; the young homeless allowance is to be made available on a weekly basis; and there are a number of other reforms. But the social security measures in this Budget are at the end of a long line of cost-cutting, and the Government has not loosened the screws at all on those people who are unemployed through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could have done so much more for these people in this Budget. I give just two examples that the Democrats have been pushing for some time. There could have been, firstly, a reversal of the Government's disastrous decision of two years ago to reduce the incomes of young people receiving social security payments, a material cause of the catastrophic youth homelessness identified by the Burdekin report; and, secondly, the reduction or elimination of the waiting periods for social security payments. This is universally acknowledged by welfare organisations to be the cause of increasing demand upon their services and increasing suffering for families. The Government's failure to move on these issues demonstrates that in social justice terms this Budget represents a government that is treading water while those around it drown. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to superannuation, the centrepiece of what has been described as a nothing Budget. It was the long awaited announcement on superannuation and what it will do for domestic savings in the next decade. However, it is not only unimpressive but perhaps the most disappointing feature of this Budget that these domestic savings are not being mobilised in a strategic manner to assist the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> What could be more justified in the investment of superannuation funds than the placement of a proportion of these funds in government and public utilities which pay a reasonable rate of return and which are government guaranteed? Clearly, the use of superannuation funds in this way opens up the possibility of funding public infrastructure investment, freeing other funds for equity investment in the private sector. However, the Government has so far chosen not to respond to our calls for this strategic measure, which offers the key for a significant improvement in our economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I now return to the actual provisions that the Government has announced. Apart from the compulsory minimum contribution proposals, which I will deal with later, two papers were distributed by the Treasurer dealing with various aspects of the regulation of superannuation. The first paper concerns the prudential supervision of the industry and the second paper deals with the disclosure of information to members of superannuation funds. Both of these matters are to be examined by the Select Committee on Superannuation, initiated by the Democrats, which became necessary due to the lack of progress by the Government in these important areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper dealing with prudential controls borders on the pathetic. Firstly, we have the assertion in the accompanying press release that any direction of fund investment is not on the agenda. I have dealt with that before. It is perhaps the major disappointment of this Budget that the Government is not prepared to use this strategic measure to pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps. I quote from the paper:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not intend to specify where funds can invest, except to the extent necessary for prudential purposes, because this could inefficiently allocate resources, with consequential detrimental effects on members' entitlements and the economy generally. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus the complete hands-off approach to financial regulation is being perpetuated. Yet page 1 of Mr Kerin's Budget statement states:</PARA>
<PARA>There was an unprecedented and unsustainable boom in asset prices in the second half of the 1980s. Its subsequent unwinding pulled the rug out from under many speculative investments and business ventures. </PARA>
<PARA>This extremely inefficient allocation of resources, especially the oversupply of central business district property, can be traced directly to the deregulation of the financial system. We are now living through the recession which had to follow the naive deregulation of the financial system. </PARA>
<PARA> With 10 per cent unemployment, we are still being told that we cannot interfere with the market. Why can our productive small businesses not have access to appropriate amounts of development capital? Why is it more efficient to have invention after invention developed in foreign factories, creating foreign jobs, because we lack the patient capital and the acumen to do it ourselves?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the former Treasurer, the architect of deregulation, has noted that he did not want to see a boom in Sydney and Melbourne real estate to be the only result of the engineered shift in the savings mix to superannuation. Senator Button, to his credit, has long acknowledged the need for long term development funds. He tried to establish a $1 billion fund to fill this market failure, but was stymied by the short-sighted failure of the life insurance companies to make a contribution to Australia's future. Tragically, he has now abandoned that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no prudential standard proposals in the paper other than the possibility of requiring trustees of funds of an unspecified size to be corporations. We are also told that some additional, but again unspecified, solvency and prudential requirements `possibly along the lines of the requirements of the Life Insurance Act' are being considered. Given that the Government has been reviewing the Life Insurance Act for years and that some decisions have had to be taken because of the Regal-Occidental scandal, the failure to provide a lead on the vital question of prudential standards is indicative of the Government's cavalier attitude to Australian investors. </PARA>
<PARA> There are serious structural problems with the newly established dispute resolution mechanisms in respect of life insurance and general insurance, despite the appointment of some excellent people to those bodies. This occurred because of inadequate consumer involvement in the initial establishment consultations. This mistake must not be repeated in the case of superannuation, yet we have a failure to specify adequate prudential requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> One other point needs to be made on this paper. The Treasurer stated quite clearly that the Government will not guarantee superannuation funds, adding that the final risk must lie with the investor. This statement has been made in the very week when legislation has been introduced into this chamber which proposes to impose a levy on life insurance policy holders because of a financial scandal and huge losses incurred within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The second paper released by Mr Kerin deals with the disclosure of information to members of superannuation funds. This document is superior to Budget Paper No. 1, as it actually announces measures to be implemented such as additional information to be provided to members at entry and exit, additional information relating to master trust and similar arrangements, and information to be provided to members in advance of a repatriation of a surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the major proposal of this Budget. The Government-after much indecision which culminated in an eleventh hour kitchen cabinet meeting at the Lodge-has announced what is undoubtedly an historic proposal to create a universal superannuation contribution regime which will provide adequate retirement income for Australia's work force for the next century and beyond. Compulsory employer contributions will rise to 9 per cent by the year 2000 and a further 3 per cent will be announced in the future which will arise from a cut in income tax or some sort of wage-tax trade-off. The scheme will be based on the training guarantee scheme model and will be known as the superannuation guarantee levy. As long as the minimum contribution has been made by the employer, there will be no liability on the employer under the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business, which is defined as those employers with a payroll of less than $0.5m per annum, will be liable to a slower phase-in of the levy, with the liability for 1992-93 to be at the rate of 3 per cent instead of the big business rate of 5 per cent. This means that those small businesses already paying the minimum 3 per cent award superannuation-which is the vast majority-will be completely unaffected by this proposal until at least 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA> However, apart from the contribution schedule, the details provided are totally inadequate. There are also anomalies in the information provided in the Budget Papers which prevent serious consideration of these proposals at this stage. For example, we are not told how the proposals will apply to the public sector with its current huge unfunded liability. Secondly, the Budget Papers state:</PARA>
<PARA>To meet the prescribed standard, the prescribed level of employer superannuation support will be required to vest immediately and will be fully preserved. Employers will be able to provide such support through any complying superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement assumes that all complying superannuation funds are currently required to fully vest all employer contributions in respect of members. However, this is not the case at all. Either the Government has secretly decided on a complete change in the vesting and preservation rules without specifically stating its intentions, or it has got it wrong in the document released on Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA> Under existing arrangements, the only employer contributions that must be immediately vested and fully preserved are those arising from 3 per cent award agreements. New or improved employer financed benefits after 22 December 1986 are required to be fully preserved only to the extent that they are vested, which is contingent on the provisions of the relevant trust deed. All other employer financed benefits-which constitute the vast majority-are not currently subject to any vesting or preservation requirements, although the Government has announced its intention to introduce a 10-year vesting and preservation scale to commence on 1 July 1995. As presented here, many existing employer contributions would not qualify as contributions under the levy and will make a vast difference to the liability of employers who have played the game so far by complying with superannuation requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the environment. The Treasurer's announcement of a 30 per cent increase in spending on the environment is put into its shabby perspective when one realises that this apparently impressive increase lifts this expenditure to a paltry $143m. This Budget makes no mention of the urgent need to place the economy on an ecologically sustainable footing, nor does it fund measures which could achieve that goal. The extra spending is a fragment of pale green tinsel trying to conceal a large dark brown package. </PARA>
<PARA> This is despite the fact that the Australian economy is faced with the great challenge of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, reversing the degradation of our agricultural soils and marine resources, and reducing industrial pollution-this latter item given new meaning by the recent chemical fire disaster in Melbourne. Despite some promising measures scattered throughout the Budget, the environment area remains seriously under-funded. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to education. Higher education continues to be under stress while students are asked to pay more. The Federal Government has broken its promise that tertiary fees will not be increased, while failing to address the increase in student enrolments in response to the Prime Minister's call for a clever country. There is some improvement in capital funding, but recurrent funding remains insufficient to cope with over-crowding in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1991, universities enrolled an extra 45,000 students, including about 18,000 unfunded students. Funding has declined by 12 per cent per full time student. At 8.1 per cent, there has been no increase in the education share of total Budget outlays. In tertiary education, the real increase in funding is half the increase of the previous financial year. Surely that is an indictment of a country which the Government has the objective to turn into a clever country. The Democrats are also concerned about moves towards privatisation of higher education with provision for shared funding of 600 new places in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, to prove how much tougher it is, the Opposition has stated that there should have been an additional $3 billion in spending cuts. This highlights the ridiculous nature of the public spending debate in Australia. No matter how low the level of public spending is, it is always too high for the Opposition. Just as predictably, the call for cuts is never specific. </PARA>
<PARA> To counter this empty rhetoric, the Budget Papers-specifically table 10 on page 22 of statement 3 of Budget Paper No. 1-contain estimates of the effect that a 1 per cent cut in outlays would have on all other programs given that public debt interest, defence, all personal benefit payments and financial assistance grants to the States cannot be cut. That table shows that a reduction of 2.7 per cent would be needed in all other programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Opposition wishes to reduce outlays by $3 billion, it will have to reduce all other programs by 8 per cent. That is, 8 per cent less for disadvantaged schools, 8 per cent less for our chronically crowded universities, 8 per cent less for beneficiaries of the rural adjustment scheme, 8 per cent less on scientific and general research, 8 per cent less funds for roads and, indeed, 8 per cent less resources for the Senate, the Parliamentary Library and every other program funded by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other item that I would like to mention briefly before I turn to revenue measures, and that is the ABC. When we look at the figures in this particular Budget, we see that they continue the history of this Government which has never, in its whole existence, given a real increase in funding to the ABC. So much for its commitment to unbiased information. The only thing that one can say is that, yet again, we face an area where the two old parties agree because, clearly, the Opposition would cut the Budget of the ABC even further. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to revenue measures. There are certain revenue measures which are welcome, such as the removal of the anomaly which limited income tax deductibility of personal superannuation contributions to $3,000 if any amount of award superannuation were earned during the year. We welcome this measure. Other major decisions concern the belated plugging of some tax avoidance loopholes such as the introduction of a foreign investment funds regime, and technical changes to the imputation regime including the alignment of treatment of registered organisations with that of mutual life assurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Other measures include a proposal to tax some lottery earnings, greater compliance initiatives in the area of employment declaration forms, and some restatement of prior announcements such as provisional tax exemption for pensioners and the proposed insurance policy holders protection levy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the adoption of the Democrats alternative Budget policy which is to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax by the Medicare levy to align the rate with the top marginal income tax liability. Obviously this is a welcome, if minor, move. The only sales tax measure is a proposal to limit the sales tax exemption on motor vehicles for people with disabilities to non-luxury vehicles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Before the dinner break I spoke on the subject of Senator Hill's motion on Yugoslavia and expressed support for that motion. I did so in the belief that I was speaking to General Business motion No. 317. In fact, it appears that the motion before the Senate was General Business order of the day No. 120 which was, for all practical purposes, identical with motion 317 but for an additional paragraph which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(e) further calls upon the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations on how Australia might, consistent with a desire to preserve peace, support the newly evolving, independent states, including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever else I might do as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I do not think it is appropriate that I should ever get up in this place and support a motion for the recall of an ambassador in circumstances, so far as Government policy is concerned, where it is manifestly inappropriate to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> This was an error which arose as the result of a failure of communication between the office of the Parliamentary Liaison Officer and my own office. I regret that the mistake occurred. I do not have any difficulty with paragraphs (a) to (d) of General Business order of the day No. 120, that is, the motion we are in fact debating but, for very obvious reasons, I do have some difficulty with paragraph (e). Accordingly, I would take this opportunity both to explain that to the Senate and also to move by way of amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That paragraph (e) be deleted from this motion. </PARA>
<PARA>I do so because it is not, in our judgment, appropriate as a routine matter-or even these days as an exceptional matter-to recall ambassadors as a gesture of disapproval. That may have been familiar diplomatic practice once upon a time but it is not the practice that in this day and age we regard as especially sensible. Almost invariably, if past practice were to be followed, the situations in which one does recall an ambassador are those situations where one most needs the ambassador on the ground to maintain a high level of representation and quality of reporting because the situation is fast moving, difficult, sensitive or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> That is exactly the situation in Yugoslavia at the moment. It does not make sense in my judgment to recall the Ambassador for this or any other purpose. If one wants to make a gesture of disapproval of a regime-and that is perfectly understandable in the present circumstances-there are other ways in which one can do that, that is, by explicit public statement or some other appropriate measure. I say this particularly in the context of current diplomatic practice where we do not recognise or derecognise governments depending on how we feel about them-as I explained to Senator Harradine in answer to a question the other day-but operate on the principle of establishing diplomatic relations on the basis of our recognition of states and using other methods to demonstrate approval or disapproval, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that has clarified the matter for the record. I also hope that, in the interests of getting a unanimous resolution of this Senate on a matter that is of significance internationally and one where a unanimous resolution would be appropriate, it might be possible in the spirit of this place for Senator Hill to accept that particular amendment. I ask him accordingly to do so. I thank the Senate for its indulgence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to take up too much time of the Senate at this stage, but I do want to speak very strongly in support of the motion that was moved by my colleague Senator Hill in the Senate last week. This motion replaced an earlier motion that had been moved by him. The motion was strengthened by adding various parts and amending three-not one-of the four paragraphs in the original motion. We were greatly assisted-if I may pay a tribute to the work of Senator Harradine-in the strengthening of that motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very important motion for several reasons. The first reason is that it does give a message to the authorities in Belgrade that Australia views with the gravest concern and deplores the situation that has arisen in Slovenia and Croatia where more than 300 civilians are reported to have been killed largely as a result of the attacks of terrorists supplied by the communist-led Federal Army and attacks by the Army itself. Since that motion was moved by Senator Hill last week, there have been further deaths and the situation grows graver by the day. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion is very important in conveying to the authorities in Belgrade the very firm views of the Australian people in deploring what is taking place there. It is also a very important motion because it gives a message to all Australians, particularly to those Australians whose country of origin is Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia or any of the other republics. The importance of this motion to those Australians, whose countries of origin is one of those to which I have just referred, is very considerable indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to all those hundreds of thousands of people, whose country of origin is those nations, because the contribution they have all made to the Australian economy, Australian society, Australian culture and the Australian way of life has been enormous. I would also take this opportunity to congratulate all those people for the restraint that they have exercised here in Australia at this terribly difficult time with the events taking place in the Yugoslav republics. </PARA>
<PARA> I was going to welcome the support that Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, had given for the motion before the dinner break. I was going to say that it was a very significant advance on the part of the Government because it is very important to have a united approach if we are going to be able to make a contribution in our own way as a nation to help ease the tensions occurring in so many countries around the world, particularly in Yugoslavia. Hence, it was going to give me a great deal of pleasure to welcome the Government's support of that part of the motion which:</PARA>
<PARA>(e) further calls upon the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations on how Australia might, consistent with the desire to preserve peace, support the newly evolving, independent states, including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>In expressing my delight that the Government was going to do that, I was also going to express some surprise, particularly as Senator Evans's colleague Senator Loosley, in the debate in this place only a week ago, amongst other things-and he was speaking on paragraph (e) of the motion that I have just read out-said:</PARA>
<PARA>That is why the Government will be unable to agree to the final point in Senator Hill's proposition . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Loosley said. I find it staggering that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, who is in the chamber and who has just made an extraordinary admission and had a change of heart in the last two hours, did not know that Senator Hill had replaced his original motion with another motion, to which he spoke at length this time last week, and that Senator Evans's own colleague had spoken to the correct motion and had put the Government's position. Tonight, Senator Evans comes in and supports a motion that he said he thought was the one that we were debating. Everyone else knew that motion had been replaced a week ago. It is absolutely staggering that the Minister did not know that. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw to the attention of the Minister the fact that the replaced motion, or the motion that is now there, is not merely a change in the last paragraph. Three of the four paragraphs of Senator Hill's original motion were changed and strengthened. While I am dealing with that, Senator Loosley was incorrect when, on the last paragraph relating to the recall of the Ambassador, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Withdrawing our ambassador at the current stage would be an act of futility. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion does not say that we are going to withdraw the Ambassador. All the motion says is that we call upon the Government to recall our Ambassador for consultations on how Australia might, consistent with a desire to preserve peace, support the newly evolving, independent states, including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic assistance. We are not asking for the withdrawal of our Ambassador to Yugoslavia. We are asking the Government to bring the Ambassador back to have rational, meaningful consultations to achieve an end result that I thought that all Australians would have fully supported. </PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing that the governing party in this country is not prepared to recall its Ambassador for consultations that have one objective only, and that is building or preserving peace in a very troubled region of the world. Senator Loosley also went on to say that this act `would have nothing by way of diplomatic impact to recommend it'. That is not the purpose of that final paragraph of the motion. The purpose is to get the Ambassador back for meaningful consultations. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not unusual in any way; it is something that constantly happens. Why on earth do we have Australian representatives around the world if we cannot bring them back for consultations during times of acute crisis? The situation in Yugoslavia could be called nothing else than that. My earlier comments when preparing these remarks of welcoming the Government support, I am afraid, have fallen on barren ground. I very deeply regret that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go over all the points that Senator Hill made in his wide-ranging speech when he introduced the replaced motion last week. However, let me draw attention to a couple of the extremely important points. Senator Hill made the point that it is clear that Yugoslavia is breaking up; that it cannot be held together at the point of a gun; and that, in the opinion of the coalition, the international community should vigorously oppose any attempt to do so. He pointed to the referendums which have been held in Slovenia and in Croatia and which have been announced will be held in Macedonia and Bosnia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill pointed out that, overwhelmingly, the people of Slovenia and Croatia supported a move for independence. He made the point which the Opposition has made time and time again-we had a debate on the Baltic states at the same time last week where we all made the point-that if people strongly desire their freedom, independence and dignity they should be allowed to have it. Leaving aside the principles involved, it is a non-starter in this day and age for countries or groups of people to be held together, as Senator Hill said, at the point of a gun. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of the points that Senator Hill made have been demonstrated even more clearly by the dramatic events that have occurred in the Soviet Union in the past four days. That coup, which thankfully has come to nought-put down in the space of 60 short but terribly tense, dramatic hours-in many ways was a cataclysmic episode. It could have been cataclysmic for the bad; it has turned out to be cataclysmic for the good because it has shown that the path on which the peoples of the Soviet Union have set themselves under President Gorbachev is now undoubtedly irreversible. However, it demonstrates the fragility of the situation in eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> It also showed, through the actions of the Yugoslav army in the last three or four days, how unrest like that occurring in the Soviet Union can be used as a cloak by other nations to advance their own causes. We have seen a major advance in the activities of the Yugoslav army in recent days under that cloak of unrest in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports on tonight's television news that I heard suggest that the situation has worsened in the last 24 hours, despite what only a day ago seemed to be grounds for hope. Overnight, there were reports from Reuters in Belgrade saying that Yugoslavia's leaders had agreed on principles for the peaceful solution of the crisis and that the collective state presidency and presidents of the six republics worked out a four-point agreement on Tuesday-48 hours ago-to end hostilities `as violations of an August 7 cease-fire continued'. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The four points of the agreement were: recognition of the right of every people to self-determination, including secession; respect for the democratically expressed will of all peoples; equal treatment of all political options without the use of force; and the legal implementation of the accord. </PARA>
<PARA>The wire service also reported that all parties at that meeting had agreed that the essential condition for an agreement on the future of Yugoslavia was an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in the republic of Croatia. Sadly, to date, it appears that that has not occurred. One can only hope that that situation will change. </PARA>
<PARA> In my concluding remarks I want to make a couple of points about the motion that is before the House, and in particular the final paragraph which I have already read out but which bears repetition. Paragraph (e) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>further calls upon the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations on how Australia might, consistent with a desire to preserve peace, support the newly evolving, independent states, including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>That final phrase in the motion is a difficult and complex one. When is the right time for independence? Different people and different groups will have different views on that matter. Senator Hill, I and others have been involved in discussions with interested parties in the past 24 hours or so on that very point. We certainly recognise that it is a difficult decision that requires the most careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point in relation to Senator Hill's motion is that we have related it to both Croatia and to Slovenia; we have given them equal treatment in the motion. The question has been raised whether the situations in Croatia and Slovenia are the same, or whether there are not grounds for saying that one republic rather than the other is near to meeting, or has met, the conditions that would be generally accepted for independence, whereas the other one may not have achieved quite the same advance. Again, that is a very important point that requires further consideration by us all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also argued, and very persuasively by some, that recognition of, say, Slovenia's independence would assist the situation in Croatia and elsewhere in the republics. That again is a matter that requires careful consideration and it is one of the aspects that the wording of our motion, particularly the final part, will allow us further to consider. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, I wish strongly to support the motion moved on behalf of the coalition by my leader, Senator Hill, expressing very deep regret that the Government, after having given us hope, has now changed its position again. I deplore that and regret it very much indeed. I hope-although I know that it is a false hope-that having changed his view once Senator Evans, after a closer look at the final paragraph of our motion, which I think he has misinterpreted, will see whether the Government can join the Opposition in this motion. Unity and a united front on this matter would be of the greatest significance. </PARA>

<PARA> In common with Senator Short, I am sorry that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, appears to have misinterpreted the burden of paragraph (e). There are quite a number of matters that need to be discussed on a face to face level with the Ambassador to Yugoslavia. There are reports, as this motion says, that more than 300 civilians have been killed, but other reports indicate, as Senator Calvert said, that some 4,000 people have been killed. Therefore, there need to be serious consultations with the Ambassador about the facts and politics of the situation, and about the statements made by the leaders that they intend to enforce certain measures to the detriment of the republics. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also other matters to be considered. Is the person who goes under the name of Captain Dragon an Australian citizen? If he is, is he not subject to the Crimes (Foreign Incursions) Act? These sorts of things need to be considered. As Senator Short pointed out, I believe the Government has misinterpreted the meaning of paragraph (e). </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I believe that if this is carried it will send a strong message to the Yugoslav Government which must have an effect on that Government and also on a number of countries in the European Community. If Australia does make this stand, it will be in support of the democratically expressed wishes of the republics of Croatia and Slovenia and of their people. </PARA>

I also note that the Australian Democrats felt sufficiently concerned to move a motion along similar lines and to debate the matter earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee has presented a number of reports over the years. The first report concerned the exportation of live sheep from Australia. That is still a very contentious issue. There was also a report on dolphins and whales in captivity. I remember that Senator Brownhill had quite a deal to do with that report. Madam Acting Deputy President, it is interesting that it took five years to put the kangaroo report together. It was presented in 1988 and, would you believe, three years later we still have not received a response from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Animal experimentation was probably the best report that this Committee put forward-it was excellent. I was involved in the investigations for that report. I was very interested in this matter because the use of animals in experiments was, and still is, very contentious. While we were conducting our investigations we discovered that this report had the effect of provoking most teaching universities, and other establishments that used animals, voluntarily to set up ethics committees. If nothing else, in my opinion this inquiry had the effect of forcing those teaching institutions and other agencies that used animals in experiments to set up voluntary ethics committees which had a great effect on animal welfare in animal experimentation. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, the Committee presented the sheep husbandry report and, in 1990, the intensive livestock production report, which was welcomed by all those involved in intensive livestock production, except perhaps Pam Clarke in Tasmania. Nevertheless, I believe that we presented as balanced a report as we could. The recommendations from that report were quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA> An interim report was presented on the racing industry, and just today we finished the final report. Two other reports are to come before the Senate involving equine welfare and competitive events other than racing, and the transportation of livestock within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This report on feral animals highlights the concerns of many people, particularly conservation groups and all those in Australia who are concerned about our native flora and fauna. One of the conclusions we came to in this report was that feral animals pose a very major problem, particularly in the Northern Territory with the effects of horses, buffaloes and other large feral animals. The Committee believed that quantitative research should be undertaken on the agricultural and environmental damage that is being caused by individual species of feral animals. We went on to highlight what we saw as the major offenders-if one could call them that-in causing a lot of our native animals to become extinct. </PARA>
<PARA> From the evidence we have received, it seems that the major feral animals that are causing problems in northern Australia are horses, buffaloes and donkeys. One conclusion we reached was that not only must they be controlled but, ideally, also the total eradication of horses, buffaloes and donkeys would be the goal of those control programs. In this report, apart from some very fine photographs of the members of the Committee conducting their inquiries in Kakadu National Park and Alice Springs, we noted that even after eradication there still seems to be between 105,000 and 140,000 buffaloes in northern Australia. In 1985 it was estimated that there were some 340,000. The major reason why they have been reduced in number is the BTEC program that has been conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern which was raised with me and Senator Burns by politicians and others in Europe was the eradication of our wild horses such as brumbies and walers. It was estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 600,000 feral horses existed in Australia. When one considers that the next largest population of wild horses is in North America, where there are only 40,000 to 80,000, one can understand just what huge numbers of wild horses we have. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the eradication program, the number of horses around Alice Springs, for instance, has been reduced from 80,000 to 54,000. But evidence we received during the inquiry showed us that the effect that wild horses have had in that area has contributed to the reduction in numbers of a particularly fine little animal that was presented to us and tabled as evidence-the bilby. Wild horses are probably the major reason that these animals are reducing in number. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that around 14 species of native animals have become extinct because of the competition of feral animals in Australia. Many more are under threat. In fact, 42 per cent of all arid zone mammals are threatened by the existence of large feral animals in northern Australia. In the few seconds I have left, I will just say that another major problem we have is feral pigs. God knows how many of those there are in this country, but they are a major source of concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare on the culling of large feral animals in the Northern Territory is probably the only one with which I have only a little involvement. I believe that I have had a great deal of involvement with all the other reports; we will have done about 10 of them by the end of the next day or two. Much of the work for this report was done while I was away at the United Nations last year, although a considerable amount of evidence was submitted much earlier than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject matter of this report, in some aspects, was similar to the issue that the Committee had to face with the mulesing of sheep. None of the alternatives was particularly palatable. I refer, of course, to the culling of horses in the Northern Territory. I do not intend to use my time tonight to defend the position that the Committee took on this matter. In my view, the report says it all. It provides a well written, well argued position. The Committee secretary, Neil Bessell, tells me that there has been an enormous demand for the report and that it has been extremely well received. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether this report has been as well received as it has because of some of the photographs in the report which Senator Calvert talked about. I must admit that other inquiry reports I have been involved with have not had so many photographs, with people being idolised in them. But I really think the photograph of Senator Calvert in the report is among the best that I have seen included in any report since we started producing them. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more serious note, the credit for this report lies, in large part, with the secretariat. I am quite sure that Senator Burns, the Chairman of this Committee, would agree with me-and I am sure he will say something about this later. I say that, notwithstanding the work done by my colleagues-in fact, my friends-who served on the Committee. I would not have made the remark about the photographs if I did not believe that my colleague Senator Calvert is also a good friend. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that all involved with this Committee would agree that this inquiry has been a most harmonious one. I greatly enjoyed all the hearings that we sat in on together. It has been a great Committee. I would like to say thank you to Neil Bessell and his staff-Peter Short, Max Lane, Michael Game and Chris Migus-for a job well done in the time that we have been together. As Senator Calvert has already said, we have issued 10 reports. In the last three weeks, three reports have been put through their final draft. I believe that is a feat in itself, and one not matched by many other committees in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously Senator Cooney will say something about this Committee, because Senator Cooney and I both joined the Committee at the same time; we were the old people on that Committee. Senator Cooney and I can well remember that when we first joined the Committee Senator George Georges was the Chairman. He chaired the Committee in a most able way, as has Senator Burns in the time that he has been the Chairman of the Committee. In fact, I have been a member of this Committee for my entire Senate life, having taken over from Senator Scott when he relinquished that position on leaving the Senate. I am quite sure that he would like to be identified with the remarks tonight concerning the success of this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been with the Committee through thick and thin times-the thin times, when everyone in the community hated us and wanted us disbanded to where we are today with honourable senators from all parties being urged to support the continuation of this Committee. It has provided enormous interest and pleasure for me. I have met wonderful people and seen some alarming, amazing and interesting things. Actually, I am the only member of parliament who has visited every live sheep export centre. I have been on a transport ship, visited the feedlots, and been right through the whole process. I believe I am also the only senator in this place to visit every dolphinarium in Australia, which I did when one report was being put together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been through abattoirs-apparently one abattoir too many for the Committee Secretary. As Senator Calvert has said, during the racing inquiry we went to the Melbourne Cup and looked at how animal welfare was associated with that event. It was a very interesting Melbourne Cup because it was the one at which Cole Diesel was swabbed and another horse completed an extra round of the track and collapsed at the end of the race. We spent a lot of time with the Chief Veterinary Steward, Dr Bourke. He was an example of the sort of people we have met during the hearings we have held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not the end of the animal welfare reports because we will be talking about other reports when the Government responds to them. This Committee has allowed me to address seminars and conferences and submit papers to people here and in the United States. There has been widespread interest in animal welfare all over the world and this interest will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saddened that we are now winding up this Committee but, hopefully, everyone will support the rural affairs committee when it comes to the Senate on Wednesday week. I think we should carry on the good work of this Committee and expand its reference so that it can look at other things associated with rural and primary industry areas. </PARA>
<PARA> A very important area that I do not think we have looked at is the companion animal industry. I believe that is an area we will want to look at closely in the future because it is an area where animal welfare practices are not as good as they should be. I believe the animal welfare issue is vital for rural Australia and for the entire community. As I said before, I am saddened at this Committee's passing, but I look forward to its continuing in another guise. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some of my colleagues are very worried about the fact that I am not addressing myself to this report. Obviously, Senator Patterson wants to talk about something else. But I believe this report is a good report. I congratulate my colleagues on the job that they have done as members of this Committee: for example, the hard work that they put in all through the Northern Territory when we were investigating the welfare and the culling of large feral animals. I know that Senator Collins will be very happy with this report, and I am quite sure that this report will receive favourable comment from the Government as well as from the people in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very proud of the report of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare on the culling of large feral animals in the Northern Territory, in the knowledge that there are various points of view as to how we should go about doing that. The Committee, under its reference and its title-animal welfare-really should not have been concerned about economics. When I say `economics' I mean in terms of the pastoral industry where one might use the store of feral animals to make a profit. Our concern was animal welfare, but of course in the process of discussing our report economics did come into it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Along with Senator Brownhill, I am very much appreciative of the role of the staff in this inquiry. They organised visits, public hearings and gave the Committee certain research work which enabled it to perform fairly well. I also pay tribute to the fact that the members of the Committee did not operate on the basis of party politics. We looked at the issues and we were fairly objective in our views. I can assure the Senate that they were not always at one-and this report shows that, just as other reports will. However, I think the staff and the Committee operated fairly well and gave to the Senate and to the nation a report which has been fairly well received. </PARA>
<PARA> The witnesses, also, had great convictions and beliefs about what should be done about animal welfare. There were those who felt that animal welfare was already well served. While there was a difference of opinion about where we should go, the conviction and the preparation of witnesses when they came to the Committee to answer questions was fairly obvious. I would also like to thank those people. </PARA>
<PARA> The culling of feral animals has a worldwide application. There are people in Europe who are very concerned about shooting wild horses from helicopters. They have long held the belief that it was based on rich sportsmen who went out just to shoot horses for sport. They did not understand that it was about the elimination of those animals which were destroying the environment and which, quite often, died very painful deaths in times of drought. I believe that the decision of the Government to circulate this document worldwide to our various embassies to make that information available is a very important and very sensible approach. </PARA>
<PARA> There are people who would say that we should keep a depository of feral animals because they are useful for hunting by people who like to shoot off guns at anything that moves, and there are people who believe that there is some economic gain to be had. I make it very clear, as Chairman of the Committee, that we should eliminate every feral animal in this country. We would then do away with the animal welfare problem, the problem of the destruction of the environment and all of those adverse effects on people on the land who find themselves with problems because of feral animals destroying their livelihood. There are people who believe that we should keep those animals in our community. That is fine, but let them manage the animals and not let them become feral, running wild and destroying the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> After this session tonight the Committee will no longer exist. I think it is useful for me to comment on a few things. Next week, when I present to the President reports on equine welfare, transport of livestock and racing, the work of the long running Select Committee on Animal Welfare will be completed.</PARA>
<PARA> As the current Chairman of the Committee, it is appropriate to take this opportunity to comment on the contribution that the Committee has made over the last eight years. Honourable senators will be aware that in November 1983 the Senate established this Select Committee to inquire into and report on animal welfare in Australia. During the life of this Committee more than 700 submissions have been lodged by organisations and individuals, more than 150 volumes of oral and documentary evidence have been published and, I dare say, hundreds of public hearings have been held throughout the country and thousands of witnesses have been called and examined. I suppose that there are other committees in the Senate that have similar records, but I do not think they would be select committees, they would be standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Committee began its program of public hearings in May 1984. Those hearings covered a range of topics allowing members to gain a better appreciation of the issues involved in the animal welfare debate. At that time, the Committee decided to concentrate on three topical issues: the live sheep export trade, whales and dolphins in captivity and kangaroos. Reports on these matters were tabled in 1985, 1986 and 1988 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 the Committee commenced a series of hearings. These hearings resulted in the reports on animal experimentation, tabled in 1989; sheep husbandry, also tabled in 1989; and intensive livestock, tabled in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Committee, I am particularly proud that, as a result of the work over the last 10 months, the current Committee will add a further three reports to this list. These reports address issues relating to the culling of large feral animals, the transport of livestock within Australia and equine welfare. The Committee also hopes to report on evidence presented in 1988 and 1989 on the racing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to take up the time of the Senate with a review of all of the reports tabled and Government responses to them. I would, however, like to make some observations about the role and the contribution of this Committee. It is my view that over the last eight years the Select Committee has provided a very valuable forum for the review of topical and sometimes emotive issues relating to animal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the debate on animal welfare issues in other countries has been volatile and, in some instances, violent. Generally, this has not been the case in Australia. Several commentators, and even overseas visitors, have recognised that the Select Committee has played a constructive role in fostering a rational and considered debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard I would like to quote from correspondence recently lodged with the Committee. It is one thing to make a statement, but it is another to have it backed up by clear evidence of the views of others. First, I wish to quote from a primary industry association. The association states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has seen fit at times to criticise some animal welfare matters within the industry. This has been a small price to pay to gain access to an independent, objective forum where claims about the industry can be examined and responded to. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, I quote from an animal welfare group. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The work of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare has been of great importance in providing a forum, leading the way to improved welfare of all animals whose lives are influenced by people. The continuing debate on welfare has been stimulated and guided by a series of public hearings and subsequent reports of the Committee. All views on animal welfare have been heard and considered and a wealth of information has been collected and documented. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a credit to the 14 honourable senators who have served on the Committee that a Select Committee has established this profile and prestige. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that all of those who have served on the Select Committee will join with me in paying a particular tribute to former Senator George Georges, Chairman of the Committee from 1983 to 1987, and to Senator David Brownhill who has been a member and Deputy Chairman of the Committee since 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, this Select Committee has demonstrated that, although reports and recommendations to Government are important, maintaining a dialogue and establishing a conduit between concerned citizens and the Parliament are also most productive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare is a remarkable Committee. In this Committee we would not, at any stage, have somebody shouting at us to sit down. It is not that sort of Committee at all-quite the contrary. It is, at times, very hurtful that people for whom I have nothing but the greatest respect shout at me across the floor as was done on this occasion. It is certainly something that would never come from your lips, Madam Acting Deputy President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I sincerely say that this is a good Committee-it is a great Committee-and I think the atmosphere here tonight shows that. What struck me is that a senator whose office is near Lygon Street, Melbourne, does not look out upon the animal kingdom. On the other hand, I got from the people whom I associated with on the Committee a feeling of the love of animals that they really have. I did not realise that Senator Burns has had a lot to do with horses. Senator Brownhill-and I hope he is listening to this, because it is said sincerely-has shown to me just what love for animals is. I say the same for Senator Bell, Senator Calvert and Senator Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Calvert, along with Senator Brownhill, introduced a very sensible and rational approach to this aspect. It is an area where great emotions can, at times, run a little astray. On that topic-and I simply want to use this as an illustration-I refer to shooting from helicopters. I think it would be fair to say, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to both Senator Burns and Senator Calvert that this had us worried, but when we saw what damage was being done by feral animals, and that this was the only way of controlling them, we recommended that it continue. Helicopter shooting was very dangerous to the people in the helicopter at times, and the concern that they showed was quite amazing.</PARA>
<PARA> I also pay tribute to our Committee Secretary, Neil Bessell. I think everybody would agree that he has been an outstanding Secretary. This Committee has been under the Chairmanship of Senator Burns, Senator Morris and Senator George Georges- whose praises have been greatly sung tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee has done great work because we have introduced into the community a concept of animal welfare that was not there before. Senator Brownhill would agree that we have done that quite magnificently. It is also an exciting committee because, in contrast to other committees, it is devoted to that hymn of life. I say in all sincerity that one feels closer to God and closer to nature as a member of this Committee than as a member of any other committee that I have been on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table a revised explanatory memorandum and move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill will amend several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature or which correct existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major new policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments will not have a significant financial impact. The proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977 are expected to lead to savings of the order of $15,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will permit the Trade Practices Commission to charge for material published by it. It is estimated this will result in revenue of $33,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill. I intend to confine my comments to the more noteworthy amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>A provision is to be inserted into the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to provide that, where a State or Territory law alters the name of a body or of an office, a reference in a Commonwealth Act to the body or office under the old name shall be construed as a reference to the body or office under the new name. The amendment will overcome difficulties which recently arose where the name of a State Crime Commission referred to in a Commonwealth Act, was altered by State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>An amendment will also be made to allow a board member of a statutory body to participate at board meetings by telephone, closed-circuit television and other modern electronic means of communication. Several Acts already make provision for this form of participation. The amendment will remove the need to enact such provisions in individual Acts, and overcome the problems which arise if members are precluded from participating in board meetings unless physically present. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will repeal provisions in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 requiring estimates of receipts and expenditure to be approved by the Attorney-General before monies appropriated can be spent. These provisions are not necessary, as the Tribunal and courts operate under the Department of Finance Ledger System whereby the funds appropriated are controlled and released by the Department of Finance in accordance with validated claims submitted by each agency. Such claims must be in accordance with Finance Regulations and Directions. The issue of funds is also in accordance with the running cost splits separately identified in the Budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933 will clarify the current provision dealing with proceedings related to the winding-up of companies. The revised provisions will make it clear that the powers given to the Master and the Registrar in relation to winding-up proceedings may be exercised interchangeably between the Master and the Registrar. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the ASIO Act will bring procedures for the handling of warrants relating to postal articles into conformity with the procedures for the handling of warrants relating to telecommunications and will place the Australian Capital Territory in the same position as the States and the Northern Territory so far as the performance by ASIO of its functions is concerned. The Bill also includes other amendments of a consequential nature. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment to the Bills of Exchange Act 1909 will remove the provision for adding three extra days, known as `days of grace', to the maturity date of bills of exchange that are not payable on demand. This practice, which allows extra time for payment of a bill of exchange or promissory note, is out of step with general international practice. The proposed amendment will bring Australian law into line with similar provisions under United Kingdom and New Zealand law. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977 have a two-fold purpose. First, to abolish the National Legal Aid Representative Council, and second, to amend the Act to enable a further member to be appointed to the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee (NLAAC). </PARA>
<PARA>The Council, a twenty-member body, was established administratively in September 1987, and given a statutory basis by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Act 1988. The Council is one of two advisory bodies established by the Act, the other being the NLAAC, a 7 member body of persons possessing particular expertise relevant to legal aid policies and programs. The Council was created to give representatives of major legal aid providers and consumers a forum for discussion and to enable them to provide advice to the responsible Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the past 3 years, both bodies have been responsible for advising the Minister on legal aid matters. However, while the NLAAC meets about 5 times a year, the Council only meets once a year. </PARA>
<PARA>The three occasions on which the Council has met have shown that it is not an effective body. Its continued operation, at a cost of approximately $20,000 per year, is an unjustified duplication of effort given the role of the NLAAC. In July 1990, the NLAAC presented a detailed report on a 2-year review it had conducted of legal aid programs and policies. </PARA>
<PARA>In its Report, the NLAAC has recommended that there be regular national and international legal aid conferences at which a wide range of interested organizations, groups and individuals could discuss legal aid issues. Such conferences would provide a more effective forum for exchanging ideas and developing new policy proposals than the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The other amendment will expand the NLAAC to 8 members, thereby broadening the relevant expertise and experience of its members. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments to the Statutory Declarations Act 1959 will simplify the processes for witnessing statutory declarations and provide a more accessible service to members of the public and business community by broadening the categories of persons able to witness statutory declarations. The amendments will also remove the requirement for the Attorney-General, or his delegate, to make appointments as a Commissioner for Declarations. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will authorise the Trade Practices Commission to make charges and impose fees in certain areas of its activities, thereby improving the Commission's revenue base and providing a means for the utilisation of the user pays principle in relation to some of the Commission's activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will authorise the Commission to make charges in relation to the supply of material it publishes in the course of carrying out its functions or exercising its powers. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will also enable regulations to be made permitting the Commission to make charges or impose fees in relation to a person's attendance at or participation in an activity arranged by or on behalf of the Commission, such as a seminar, the provision of prescribed discretionary services by the Commission, such as providing a speaker at conferences, and the making of an application for an authorisation or the giving of a notification to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments to the Law Officers Act are to ensure that a pension will be payable to a Solicitor-General who has served in that office for at least 7 years. The Act currently provides that a pension is only payable to a Solicitor-General who has served at least 7 years and who has not been reappointed at the end of his or her term of office. </PARA>
<PARA>I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two matters on the adjournment. The first relates to comments that I did not wish to make while the blockade of Parliament House was in progress. Now that it has finished I would like to make some remarks about that blockade, picket line, or whatever one wants to call it. In particular I want to deal with the role of former Senator John Morris in this matter. When Senator John Morris was here he was renowned for indolence. I might say that he is much more energetic outside this Parliament than he ever was inside it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A low blow.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but an accurate one. I raise former Senator Morris's role in this matter because he was the key union organiser of the picket. It was he who was continually misleading his unionist colleagues about the nature of the industrial dispute. I regret that John Morris took the view that it was worth while misleading his union members largely in order to run a `get square' campaign against his former colleagues inside-and I refer in particular to the Presiding Officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the Senate are aware of the fact that both Presiding Officers are members of the right wing of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales. I think both Senator Sibraa and Mr McLeay were assistant secretaries of the Labor Party at one stage- Senator McMullan nods in acknowledgment-and apparatchiks within that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> John Morris received his comfortable ride into the Senate on the basis of a deal done with the right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales under which he guaranteed his support for the Federal Executive of the Party in exchange for being endorsed on the Senate ticket. He agreed to support the right wing at the Federal Executive. There was a pay-off, and I understand part of that pay-off was that he would get endorsement and lead the Senate ticket in the 1990 election. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, that almost came to pass. He was preselected to lead the ticket; I will not say preselected by the normal methods but, nonetheless, he was to lead the ticket for the 1990 election until the Labor Party became aware, as a result of some comments that I made in the Parliament, just how little Senator Morris had done to earn his money-at least, how little he had done in the chamber to earn his money as a senator. I think I established that Senator Morris's activities here cost the Australian taxpayer about $72 a word. He had made two speeches, totalling 4,200 words, in four years as a senator when I raised the matter again in June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I have gone into this background to dramatise that former Senator Morris then got dumped from the Labor Party ticket and was replaced by Senator Loosley. It was clearly not in the Opposition's best interests to have generated that change. Senator Loosley is a far more effective senator than John Morris could ever have hoped to be. But the point is that former Senator Morris did get dumped. It seems to me totally inappropriate for former Senator Morris then to generate the sort of hostility towards this place among former employees of the catering service, who were members of his union, such that they felt they should picket Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> Former Senator Morris generated and encouraged that dispute for the purpose of personal satisfaction, I suppose one could call it. It was a `get square', in crude political terms, bought at the cost of some of his union supporters. After listening to what the President has had to say in this chamber about that dispute, there is no doubt that there was an enormous gap between the `facts' that the unionists were being told by John Morris and the facts as we understood them in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised by many of the people working in the privatised dining room that the issue, as it was put to them, was not basically about the redundancy package or retraining requirements of only about 20 or so of the people involved. It was basically a dispute, in Morris's view, as expressed to them, over the issue of privatisation. He was seeking to reverse the decision that the Presiding Officers had taken, which saved something like one and a quarter million dollars a year of taxpayers' money. The disputation was over privatisation. Morris described those people who continued to work for us and with us-people who are our friends, who have worked for us for so many years and with whom most of us have very friendly and happy relationships in the dining room-as scabs because they had ratted on his opposition to privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying all this after the event because I did not want to worsen the dispute. The dispute is now over, but I find it intolerable that a person like Morris-who certainly did not distinguish himself in this chamber and who certainly was not a person that this chamber or any member of this chamber would be proud to be associated with-should have played such a role in trying to disrupt the operations of the Parliament and to incite the people working for us in the dining room, with whom most of us had a very good personal, friendly relationship, into such action. That he should have taken such a position is intolerable. That was only one of the points I wanted to make. I have very little regard for former Senator Morris who, I should add in passing, is now facing fraud charges in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The next thing I want to deal with is a matter of much more significance. I am most concerned about what the Government is up to in its dealings with South Africa on sport. I was under the impression that the Government was prepared to agree that, where criteria set down by the ANC-dominated organisations of South Africa were met, there was no real problem in allowing the resumption of sporting links with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Australian Cricket Board announced last week that a South African team could be included in the 1992 World Cup to be hosted jointly by Australia and New Zealand in February and March because, apart from anything else, there was no ground swell of public opinion against the South African cricketers and they had met the necessary criteria. On top of that, a spokesman for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, also said that there should be no impediment to South African cricketers playing internationally because the International Cricket Council had readmitted South Africa as it met the criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is supposed to be the situation, why did the Australian Government frustrate, delay and ultimately prevent a group of South African water-skiing officials from coming to the Australian water-skiing championships, which have taken place in Darwin over the past week? Apparently, there has been no policy statement from the Government saying that they must not come. It was simply done by the devious process of bureaucratic delay. It may well be that it is simply incompetence, in which case my conspiracy theory may fall apart. I hope that the Australian Government's people in South Africa do not have the level of incompetence that would be required to have made such a mess of this. If not, it was a specific, deliberate and determined effort of governmental frustration. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are as follows: the criteria appear to have been met. I have a letter from the National Olympic Committee of South Africa, that is, NOCSA, whose Chairman is Ramsamy. This body is the new integrated head of sport in South Africa, and it appears to relate even to non-Olympic sports, such as water-skiing. It adopted on 30 June 1991 a resolution which says:</PARA>
<PARA>Recognising the positive role played, until recently, by sports sanctions in isolating racist sport, and acknowledging the need for adapting our approach to the changed internal and external environment INOCSA (now NOCSA) decides to maintain the sports moratorium in its undated form whereby outside coaches, trainers and administrators be allowed into the country and to reserve the option to selectively exclude from such sanctions those sports meeting the following conditions . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The resolution goes on. One condition is to the effect of having been accepted by INOCSA after fulfilling the conditions listed. Water-skiing appears to have met that criterion. Instead of, in this case, outside coaches and trainers going to South Africa, the object of this exercise was for the administrators, for officials of the South African Waterski Association, to go to a world championship to see how it is done, to increase the capacity of that sport in South Africa to be administered. In other words, it basically met the requirements of NOCSA. It did more than that. I understand from correspondence that, when the Australian Government refused to act on the request for visas for these officials on the basis that they needed approval from NOCSA, the officials involved from the South African Waterski Association contacted Mr Ramsamy of NOCSA and wrote the following letter:</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to our telephone conversation this morning at 10:00 local time and enclose documentation for your information. </PARA>
<PARA>I also contacted Mr Harvey Redman, Chairman of the Ski Racing Association. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ramsamy contacted me on 14 August and said that he had no problem with visa applications-</PARA>
<PARA>that is for the water-ski officials-</PARA>
<PARA>and that we should continue with our arrangements; he is just waiting for Mr Tim Yeend of the Australian Embassy to phone him back. </PARA>
<PARA>He is probably still waiting. This letter was dated 16 August, by the way. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We were unsuccessful in contacting Mr Tim Yeend, he wasn't available. </PARA>
<PARA>We are proceeding with the applications, although Mr Yeend initially told us that it would take 4 weeks. Application as sports administrators and not tourists were made on 2 August `91. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems then that Mr Ramsamy was on side; in other words, the criteria had been met. There was no evident reason for obstruction and there was no doubt that the water-ski people were certainly welcome guests in Australia as far as the Australian organisation was concerned, because it had in fact invited them to attend. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems extraordinary that Mr Yeend told the South African water-skiers that they could not come, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Further to your contact with the Embassy, we have received advice that no visas will be issued for the Water Ski Racing Championships in Darwin from 14-26 August. We would only be prepared to consider further applications linked with the sport when it has received affiliation to the National and Olympic Committee of South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the National and Olympic Committee is in fact a national olympic committee, and water-skiing is not an olympic sport. Mr Yeend seems to have confused whatever the organisation is. There was an attempt to contact Mr Yeend; he was not available. All I am saying is, for heaven's sake, what is the Government up to? Why is it putting obstacles in the way of resuming sporting links with South Africa when the criteria appear to have been properly met?</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that it may have had something to do with the fact that, coincidentally, Mr Sisulu was visiting Australia and maybe the Government did not want this sort of thing to happen while he was here. In other words, there was some pretty poor petty politics being played because Mr Sisulu had taken a contrary view about whether we should remove our sporting bans with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sisulu disagreed with Professor Ross Garnaut, a former Prime Minister's adviser, who believes that sanctions against South Africa are no longer helpful to the cause of dismantling apartheid. He believes that we should resume our links, both commercial and sporting, with South Africa. However, when Mr Sisulu was here, at the same time as all this was going on, he called on Australians to stop the South African cricket team from playing in next year's cricket world cup because he did not think it was the right time for Australia to resume sporting links with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> My further concern about this matter is that other groups in Australia, frankly, have been dealt with pretty roughly by the Australian Government. In July, a South African women's netball group were in Australia on tourist visas and were approached by the media for interviews. This was during the world cup. They were not playing; they were observing. They were visited by immigration officials who told them that if they talked to the press they would be deported. What sort of a nation are we here at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that in the run-up to the foreign Ministers' meeting in New Delhi the Australian Government appears to be behaving not like the sovereign government of an independent people but like the toadies of people who seem to be controlling its activities from outside. I find that a very unattractive way for this Government to behave. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words tonight about National Child Protection Week, which started last Sunday and finishes on 24 August, and about its organisers, NAPCAN, which is the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Children, of course, are people. As they are our most precious resource, we need to listen to them. Looking after them is not enough; we must nurture them to ensure their lives are safe and happy. We must realise that neglecting them is actually a form of child abuse. We often hear horrendous stories of physical and sexual child abuse, but how often do we pay attention to the other forms of child abuse, which are neglect and emotional abuse? If we are unable to listen to our children or to desperate parents' cries for help, we as individuals are contributing to such abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> NAPCAN, which is an organisation that needs a lot of recognition, was established in 1987. It is the first national organisation of its kind in Australia working to promote effective care and protection of children. In my motion this morning, I mentioned Rosemary Sinclair, a foundation member of NAPCAN. She was its first president and this year she is the national coordinator. I congratulate all the people of Tamworth who were mentioned in the motion which was declared formal this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote a poem that was written by one of the young children for the celebrations of the National Child Protection Week in my home city of Tamworth last Sunday, to which I was asked to go as representing the Federal and State governments. The poem was written by an 11-year-old girl called Katrina Ward. It goes like this:</PARA>
<PARA>Will you listen to me I roared at my mother</PARA>
<PARA>Not now not now I am talking to your brother</PARA>
<PARA>Go and talk to your father he'll listen to you</PARA>
<PARA>So I went to Dad and what does he do</PARA>
<PARA>Please listen Katrina not right now</PARA>
<PARA>I'm watching the football here and now</PARA>

<PARA>They teased and tormented something different from the others</PARA>
<PARA>In came Dad to save the day</PARA>
<PARA>I'll watch the football on replay. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there is a message in that for all the people in this chamber and for people in the community about neglect of our children when we do not listen to them when they want to be listened to. The theme of the National Child Protection Week was `Listen to the Children'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to read a statement by Senator Bell, Senator Bourne, Senator McLean, Senator Coulter, Senator Kernot and Senator Lees. In the light of widespread misinterpretation of statements made on our behalf in recent days in connection with the leadership of the Australian Democrats, I make this following statement: We became aware several weeks ago that there had been exorbitant claims for overtime by one of Senator Janet Powell's staff, Mr Bill Scetrine. We now know that Senator Powell was aware of these payments by at least April 1991 and took no action to dismiss Mr Scetrine, nor did she consult with her deputy or any of the senators making this statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The evidence we have received tonight reinforces our conviction that the hours claimed by Mr Scetrine were well in excess of the hours worked, the claim being $59,000 over the nine months from 1 July 1990 to 28 March 1991, that amount being over and above his base salary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Hansard of 21 December 1990 shows that Mr Scetrine's base salary was between $30,370 and $31,150. We are convinced that Senator Powell either did know or should have known that these claims were excessive and that her failure to take decisive action constituted gross mismanagement. This conviction was central to our reasons for expressing the lack of confidence in Senator Powell last Monday. We dissociate ourselves from Mr Scetrine's claims and Senator Powell's response to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a short statement to clarify the situation as put forward by Senator Coulter. When I became Leader of the Australian Democrats, Mr Bill Scetrine was placed on the APS grade two staff position, having been moved from my electorate staff to assume the job of Press Secretary to the Leader. He was also briefed to coordinate media work of all senators. In late April, I was formally notified by the Department of Administrative Services that overtime payments were accumulating at a very high level. I immediately took action to move Mr Scetrine to a private secretary position which attracts a set ministerial staff allowance rather than overtime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subsequently, on 7 May 1991, the Assistant General Manager of the Department of Administrative Services wrote to me saying that he had carried out a review, that the amount of overtime claimed `must be regarded as excessive', and acknowledged my remedial action. This is the first time that a leader of the Australian Democrats has used a full time press secretary. It is now obvious, given the heavy demand on time, that the private secretary position is the appropriate one for such a staff member. I acknowledge my lack of oversight and I believe that a review of the situation around the end of last year, after all the other positions on leader staff had been filled, might have been wise. However, once I was alerted to the situation I took prompt action and this was acknowledged by the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA>
