<TITLE>Pensions: CPI Relativity</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that pensioners are being burdened with an increase in the cost of living and are receiving no compensation for it. Because the CPI is not specific to the spending patterns of pensioners, a decrease in the cost of living has been shown as 0.1% which therefore cuts out a rise for this September. CPI has shown a negative movement because within its basket of goods, are luxury items that have dramatically decreased in price and therefore cover the increase in basic consumer items that are relevant to the spending patterns of pensioners. Also the wage/tax deals that have occurred between the Federal Government and unions has meant that Australian workers have received an increase in their take home wage but we have seen no counterbalance occur for pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to negotiate with the Federal Government to introduce a pension CPI measurement that takes into consideration the spending patterns of pensioners. Also that a $4.50 rise be granted to pensioners to compensate them for the wage/tax deals that occurred in January `91.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not taking it out on anybody, except that it is the third time that it has occurred, and throughout the whole of this week I am going to exercise my rights under the Standing Orders so that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) clearly gets the message that it is not fair to make arrangements for negating the adjournment debate when no negotiations have taken place with me or with a number of other honourable senators, as was the case last night. I do not know whether negotiations took place with the Democrats. The Minister might have the power to negotiate, and honourable senators on the Government side may have given the Minister the authority to negotiate a negation of the adjournment, and that may have been the case on the other side of the Senate, too, although I do not know. But so far as I am concerned, last night was a case in point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an interesting example last night, because those people who did the negotiations, presumably the Leader of Government Business in the Senate and his opposite number on the other side of the Senate, well knew that the matters that were to be debated in relation to the Estimates Committee E report included matters about which I had indicated reservations. They would have known that in those circumstances I should have been consulted. Indeed, officers involved in that Estimates committee debate did not expect that the adjournment would be negated and therefore were not in their offices. My own officers did not expect that to occur and therefore they were not in their offices. It is unfair that that sort of action should be taken behind our backs and for us to then be told, `Oh well, if we are more than half way through debate on an Estimates committee report we will negative the adjournment to allow us to clean it up'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Determination by the Minister for Social Security of directions under subsection 1237(3) of the Social Security Act 1991 dated 8 July 1991, tabled in the Senate on 13 August 1991, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not spend a lot of time on this motion today as I understand that the Opposition will not be supporting us. We did allow more time so that this matter could be looked into thoroughly, and I must say I am very disappointed now that the decision has been made not to support this motion. However, I do want to make sure that all honourable senators understand what it is that they will be voting against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These directions issued by the Minister under subsection 1237(3) of the Social Security Act 1971 are, I believe, yet another attempt by this Government to fetter the discretionary powers of courts and tribunals. I want to make the point that the directions under discussion are before us in this disallowable form only because of our initiative, an initiative of the Australian Democrats earlier this year, and an initiative that at that time won the support of the Opposition. This forced the Government at least to provide the opportunity to the Parliament to study this document. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, as passed during the autumn session, contained a clause which removed from the review of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal a determination made by the Minister under what was then section 2511b of the Social Security Act 1947 to give directions to the Secretary about the Secretary's power to waive a debt due to the Commonwealth resulting from an overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the Scrutiny of Bills Committee expressed its concern that this removal of the power to review was being put in place and noted that such a decision by the Minister was also not desirable;  that is, section 2511C required the Minister to allow any such decision before Parliament, but there was no provision for either House to disallow the decision. The Australian Democrats and the Opposition were not happy about removing this power from the SSAT. We certainly believe that ministerial determinations should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This was also the course of action preferred by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on debt recovery under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume in recognition of the potential of the ministerial determinations to significantly fetter the authority of both the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Opposition agreed to support the Democrat amendment to make a determination a disallowable instrument under this subsection. I might add that we had to move this amendment twice and both times it was supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 July the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) made a determination of directions under the subsection and issued a notice in which he set out the specific circumstances in which the power of the Secretary can be exercised to waive the right of the Commonwealth to recover a debt owed to it under the Social Security Act 1991. It needs to be clearly understood that, as well as binding the Department, these determinations also lock in the SSAT and the AAT in this particular set of directions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have concerns about both the content and the effect of these directions. Before I discuss what these are, I want to make clear what effect this disallowance motion will have, as there has been some misunderstanding in the past when I have endeavoured to disallow a motion. A successful disallowance motion involves both legislative and political action. If the Senate disallows this instrument, it simply ceases to have effect. However, the idea behind the disallowance motion is that, if the Senate has the numbers to disallow the instrument, the Government has to come up with a motion that is acceptable, something that the Senate will pass. In other words, it is a negotiating tool and one that does have some power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government does not want to be left in a vacuum in the area covered by the disallowable instrument, it must redraft the instrument or regulation fairly quickly and re-present it. In relation to this instrument, it could be withdrawn or redrafted&mdash;that would be fine&mdash;but it also quite simply could be allowed to lapse because its absence in this case would not leave any vacuum at all. This is because, firstly, the present mechanisms that are in place are adequate and, secondly, the Government could, if it chose to do so, issue these directions as departmental guidelines, thereby restricting their application to the officers of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to our main problem with the instrument:  it undermines the principle of independent review of administrative decisions. Indeed, it represents, as the Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney has accurately noted, an attempt to bind independent tribunals with administrative directions which carry a political agenda. I believe it is very important for the Opposition to see beyond the subject matter of this particular instrument and to look at that. This instrument is part of a pattern of government legislation that I believe is not desirable and may well be highly dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular instrument deals with overpayments made under the Social Security Act. Recovery by the Commonwealth of any overpayment has, of course, always involved the exercise of some discretion. This is understandable. There may well be a variety of factors at work that explain why the overpayment was made. No-one would wish to remove from government the right to issue guidelines about the exercising of that direction. The issue here is whether this Parliament should permit the Government to extend its authority in this area to the SSAT and the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over time, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the courts have suggested a number of factors which are relevant in the exercising of that discretion. The intention of the courts is to lay down broad principles around which the discretion can be exercised in a fair manner, taking into account all the individual factors in each specific case. The criteria most often referred to with approval by the AAT and implicitly accepted by the Department are laid down in the 1983 Federal Court case of Hales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These seven factors set out in the Hales case are: first, the fact that the applicant has received public moneys to which he or she was not entitled; secondly, the way in which the overpayment arose, whether as a result of innocent mistake or fraud;  thirdly, the financial circumstances of the prospective defendant;  fourthly, the prospect of recovery;  fifthly, whether a compromise is offered;  sixthly, whether recovery should be delayed if there is a prospect that the circumstances of the person who received the overpayment may improve;  and, seventhly, compassionate considerations and the fact that the Act is social welfare legislation and any financial hardship which may result from an action for recovery must be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under each of these headings the AAT has developed a number of subfactors enabling the tribunal to apply them to diverse individual circumstances. These principles or criteria have proved their operational worth and soundness and it is generally accepted that they are a fair balance between the rights of the individual on the one hand and the public interest on the other. Indeed, in the course of my discussions about this instrument with various interested parties I could not find anyone who believed that these well established judicial principles did not provide an appropriate balance between the Department of Social Security and its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this place before, there is simply no evidence that the current system of occasionally waiving debts is not working. Of an annual budget of about $20 billion, about 0.4 of one per cent of this figure is debt owed to the Commonwealth. The Department acknowledges that 80 per cent of overpayments are a result of administrative error and do not stem from any deliberate fraud. Furthermore, in 1989-90 about $2.7m in debts to the Department was waived out of a total of $81.4m raised as overpayments. It can scarcely be argued that there are thousands of social security recipients defrauding the Department of Social Security and then having their debt to the Commonwealth waived by some mischievous people sitting on the SSAT, the AAT or, indeed, the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply untrue to imply that a system is not working and then use that as an excuse to constrain the powers of independent tribunals to make fair decisions. The implicit suggestion behind this instrument is that the tribunals and courts reviewing the decisions of the Department of Social Security are waiving debts inappropriately and improperly. The evidence indicates otherwise. I suggest to honourable senators that it is highly undesirable to allow any government, once a matter has gone to an independent review body, to restrict the ability of that review body to exercise its independent discretion to review the decisions of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that this Government does not like it when people dare to disagree. It is a fact that both the SSAT and the AAT often disagree, certainly with the Department of Social Security. The value of having an administrative review system separate from government is not just that courts and tribunals can disagree with government but that persons aggrieved by governmental decisions have a fully independent avenue for seeking redress. This instrument, in conjunction with earlier legislation, sets up a situation where a Minister can issue directions that will directly bind tribunals and limit their ability to exercise their full and independent discretion in a crucial area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, we are not suggesting that government does not act to recover debts owed to it. There is nothing to stop the Minister putting forward these criteria as departmental guidelines and binding the DSS officers to follow those. But when these criteria are also applied to supposedly independent tribunals it seems to me that we are getting onto very dangerous and shaky ground. The Opposition has recognised these dangers in the past and I believe should be supporting us and sticking to its principles in disallowing this instrument. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the uninitiated, when a DSS debt is waived it ceases to exist. A waiver is a permanent bar to the recovery of the overpayment or the debt.

Director-General of the Department of Social Security, sets out seven factors, which Senator Lees has already outlined, that were considered when deciding whether a debt should be waived. These seven factors became the basis for SSAT and AAT waiver related decisions. I doubt whether the comment that Senator Lees made that the Hales case was accepted implicitly by the DSS is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The different courses taken by the DSS and the two appellant tribunals has resulted in the responsible Minister, Senator Richardson, claiming in a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that his Department's criteria:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . which were in line with those applying in most other Commonwealth departments and agencies, were undermined over time by successive administrative review decisions. I do not believe that review bodies should be free to operate in this area according to principles of their own devising and so the Minister's directions under subsection 1237(3) should be applied consistently both by departmental staff and the review tribunals alike.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lees said that this would affect the independent review of a decision. This is not affecting the independent review of a decision. It is saying that those tribunals can make the decision independently but following the guidelines that are given. There is quite a subtle difference in that and that is the difference we have been looking at. For colleagues and senators here, we have been looking at a very fine line. The coalition has taken an enormous amount of advice and has sought to examine this very carefully. We do not believe that the independence is being fettered but that the tribunals can review the decision, given the guidelines, and review that decision independently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June, the Social Security Act was amended, notably with the support of the Democrats, to ensure that directions such as those being debated here could not be reviewed by either the SSAT or the AAT. The Democrats' reasons for disallowing this direction appear to mirror closely the reasons put forward by the Welfare Rights Unit in a letter to Senator Alston dated 2 October. In this letter, the Welfare Rights Unit expressed four particular concerns in relation to this direction. Firstly, it claimed that the direction would fetter the discretion of tribunals to waive debts. Secondly, it claimed the direction would substantially narrow the circumstances in which debts could be waived. Thirdly, it contended that the direction was based on the false premise that tribunals have gone soft on the recovery of debts and were not interested in deterring fraud. Finally, and of lesser importance, Welfare Rights claimed that the direction did not pay sufficient regard to the special circumstances of assurance of support debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very strong arguments can be made to refute each of the concerns of the Welfare Rights Unit. The `fettering of tribunals' powers' argument, which I referred to earlier, can be refuted by recognising the true role of the SSAT and the AAT. It must not be forgotten that both of these tribunal agencies are reviewing agencies and not courts of law. The SSAT draws its powers from the Social Security Act and its task is to provide independent review of decisions that have been made under that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is both illogical and inappropriate that such a body should be allowed to develop its own criteria, by way of case law, for reviewing decisions made by the DSS. If the waiving criteria had been specified in the Social Security Act from the beginning&mdash;a move which the Welfare Rights Unit itself has supported&mdash;then these tribunals would have had little or no opportunity to diverge from these criteria. The SSAT and the AAT have only been able to develop their own precedents in relation to waiver decisions because the circumstances in which waivers should and should not be granted have not been clearly defined in the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the second important point in understanding the role of these tribunals. It must also be remembered that just as they are not courts, neither are they an arm of either the Government or the Parliament. It is the role of the Government and the Parliament, and not the responsibility of these tribunals, to decide the circumstances in which debts owed to the Commonwealth should and should not be waived. Of course, the Parliament is confining or fettering the powers of these appellate tribunals by the very fact that it is making a decision on this ministerial direction. I ask the Democrats: is this not the role that the Parliament should play?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very pertinent to return to the Senate debate which occurred when the idea of such a direction was first mooted. Back in late 1988, the Democrats seemed totally and utterly unsure about whether they wanted the circumstances for DSS waivers to be decided on by the Government through the Parliament. At the same time as Senator Powell moved that this direction should be a disallowable instrument, she also moved that the Secretary of the DSS should only regard&mdash;this is very important&mdash;such directions. Has anyone ever heard anything so ludicrous?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Powell has proposed that the Parliament waste its time making a decision about whether it will disallow a piece of delegated legislation relating to the use of public money that will not have any legislative strength. At the same time, a review body set up under the very same legislation is free to go off on any tangent it desires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When refuting this fettering of powers argument, it should also be pointed out that it is very important that the ground rules upon which the decisions are made should not vary between decision makers. No matter whether a decision is being made by DSS, the SSAT or the AAT, it needs to be ensured that affected clients receive equitable treatment based on consistently applied criteria for the waiving of debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this ministerial direction sets in concrete those circumstances in which the Department and the appellate tribunals can waive debts or overpayments. It provides very clear guidelines as to when a debt owing to DSS can and cannot be waived. To this end, this direction can result only in greater consistency, greater certainty and greater equity between decisions in relation to the waiving of social security debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the overriding reason why the Minister has issued this direction is to ensure that each and every case that comes before the Department, or either of these tribunals, receives equitable treatment. This direction will ensure that there is consistency in decision making, both between tribunals and the Department and amongst decision makers within the tribunals as well as the Department. It will mean that anyone seeking a DSS waiver will know the specific circumstances in which it can and cannot be granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because these circumstances will be set out in black and white, a person will be able to make a reasonably well-informed decision as to the possibility of having a debt waived. The Department and the tribunals will be able to provide waiver applicants with clear and definitive reasons why they make decisions about the waiving of debts. Further, the setting of clear-cut guidelines will mean that it will be far easier for debtors, their advocates and the Department to assess whether there is a realistic chance of winning an appeal against a decision that has gone against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that this direction narrows the circumstances which can be taken into account when deciding whether a debt should be waived can best be refuted by examining its actual content. When considering the fairness of this direction, it must be remembered that the direction conforms with recommendation 13 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of June 1990 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Debt Recovery under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act. </EMPHASIS>The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a client receives an overpayment in the honest belief that it is part of his or her entitlement, and the overpayment occurs solely through administrative error or unreasonable administrative delay, recovery procedures be undertaken only if the department concerned shows that recovery would leave the client in no worse a position than he or she would have been had the correct payments been made.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's recommendation has been taken up in circumstance (a) of this ministerial direction. Furthermore, legal advice I have obtained points out that the present direction actually refers to the very factors the Federal Court relied upon in finding that recovery of the overpayment should be waived in Hales's case; that is, administrative error, client hardship and the possibility of recovering the overpayment. This legal advice has also concluded that the direction does not make decisions to waive or not unduly depend upon an administrative decision that is not subject to review on the merits by an individual tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also needs to be pointed out that the direction allows the offsetting of family allowance payments, as recommended by the Senate Committee in 1990. I believe that this is a fair concession. It is not appropriate to offset other unclaimed DSS benefits against a DSS debt for the simple reason that it is not possible to know with any degree of certainty that the affected person would have been eligible for the other benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not be forgotten that the direction also contains a special circumstances clause. Quite rightly, these circumstances must be extremely unusual, uncommon or exceptional. For the special circumstances clause to allow a general widening of the scope for the waiving of debts, as the Welfare Rights Unit proposes, would simply defeat the whole purpose of adopting this direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When assessing whether this direction passes the fairness test, it is also worthwhile to look at the effect it has had since it came into effect last July. My office has been advised by an officer of DSS that since this direction came into effect there have been nine relevant SSAT cases reported to its national secretariat. In two instances it was found that the SSAT's discretion was confined, but in both of these cases the debt was written off. In three of the nine cases the SSAT agreed with DSS. In two cases special circumstances were found. In the remaining case, the offset clause was used. These early results indicate to me that the direction is both effective and relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, I call on the Minister to continue to monitor those cases to ensure that this direction does not have any unintended consequences that we have not anticipated. I will be asking him to bring in a renewed direction if he sees circumstances in which it is believed that the direction could be changed to alleviate any problems that may not have been foreseen. I notice that the Minister is nodding his head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third Welfare Rights argument, which claims that the direction is based on the false premise that tribunals have gone soft on the waiving of debts, can best be refuted by referring to Hales's case. In Hales, both the Federal Court and the AAT held that DSS's failure to regard an annual review statement was the substantial or dominating cause of the overpayment, despite the fact that the respondent had failed to follow DSS's instructions and notify a change of circumstances. This set a very dangerous precedent for DSS. It is worth noting that one of the major differences between this direction and Hales is that the former provides that the debt must be `caused solely by administrative error on the part of the Commonwealth', while the latter allows for a combination of administrative error and client failure. The question is not so much whether the tribunals have gone soft, but whether it was open for them to go soft in a way that fundamentally contradicted DSS's own guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the Democrats that the coalition has taken this disallowance motion very seriously. However, we are adamant that, when all the arguments have been considered, the only sensible conclusion that can be reached is that this direction should be supported. I wholeheartedly believe that it will provide greater equity, fairness and efficiency in DSS-related waiver decisions. It will result in greater certainty for decision makers, debtors and their advocates. Contrary to the Democrats' claims, it will not result in any great narrowing of the circumstances that can be taken into account by decision makers, nor will it unreasonably fetter the powers of the appellate tribunals. Rather, I believe, this direction will ensure that the waiving of DSS debts is conducted in a more administratively and financially efficient and equitable manner. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that the Australian Democrats and the Opposition have both put a considerable amount of time and effort into determining a view on directions. I should say at the outset that the only purpose for doing this at all is to achieve some consistency in decision making, because that is always the problem.

That is the only purpose involved in the exercise today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power of departmental staff to waive debts due to the Commonwealth has existed under the Audit Act for a very long time. The exercise of the power to waive is regulated by guidelines under the Audit Act and issued by the Minister for Finance. In general terms, those guidelines require that for a payment to be waived, it must have been made as a result of departmental error and payment must have been received by the debtor in good faith. The exercise of the power to waive a debt under the Audit Act is not open to appeal to appeals tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection (1) of section 1237 of the Social Security Act provides for the possible waiver of a social security debt due to the Commonwealth. Subsection (3) of that same section permits the Minister for Social Security to issue directions concerning the waiver of social security debts. Subsection (2) of that same section of the Social Security Act makes such ministerial directions binding on the Secretary and his delegates. Paragraph (m) of section 1250(1) of the Social Security Act also makes such ministerial directions binding on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. By extension, of course, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is also bound because it has to work under the same conditions that apply to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 July I issued the set of directions which are now before the Senate in this debate. These directions are based on the guidelines of the Minister for Finance which apply to Audit Act waiver powers. They are adjusted as required for the specific needs of my portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just my view but a pretty firm view within the Government that the directions are justified in the interests of promoting the consistency to which I earlier referred.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without these directions, as a matter of law different decision makers can decide, and have decided, similar cases entirely inconsistently. In addition, any two social security appeals tribunals in different States&mdash;and even in the same State&mdash;can decide two identical cases differently. I would have thought that is not in the interests of clients or the Department and it is not a bad idea for us to do anything we can do to stop it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any one social security appeals tribunal, for its own reasons, can decide that it wants to depart from informal guidelines that are followed by the departmental decision makers. Therein lies a real problem. When a tribunal decides to depart from guidelines that it knows the decision maker was operating under, we have never ending examples of inconsistency. That is why we are here today. We need greater certainty and I think the application of consistent and fair guidelines is the only way we will get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few points to note in considering these directions. Firstly, the criteria that are set down are general in scope. They are not blanket criteria forbidding any waiver decisions. I am not certain that that has been entirely reflected in Senator Lees's views. The criteria echo what is generally applied in the Commonwealth public administration and are based, as I said earlier, on the guidelines of the Minister for Finance which apply to the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The directions bind the tribunals in the same way as do regulations. There is not much difference between these directions and regulations anyway. They are disallowable by either House; and they have been considered by a Senate standing committee. So, in any event, I would have thought we were talking about a pretty fine line of difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these directions are adopted, they still leave appeals tribunals with the jurisdiction to consider social security overpayment appeals. It seems to me that the directions still address the basic concern in respect of welfare rights. But there is still that power. Few, if any, other departments raise overpayments which can be reviewed by appeals tribunals; they are a pretty rare breed. So I would have thought it is only fair that if the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are to be in that somewhat rare category, they should have to apply consistent principles in resolving their cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Patterson, I have taken careful note of what has occurred since the directions came into effect. I think they tend to bear out the Government's view, and I understand the view of the Opposition that this disallowance motion should be defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The directions have not, as yet, created any situations that are in the category of unforseen circumstances. On no occasion thus far have I seen the need to alter anything in them. But I accept what Senator Patterson said in terms of the need for continued monitoring. I can undertake to have that not only continued but also reported in the Department's annual report so that every honourable senator can see what has occurred during that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put in a reservation about program 4, relating to assistance for people with disabilities. I did so because of serious objections I have, which have been reinforced by others in the community, in relation to this program. I can do no better than quote from a speech given by Mr Brian Corcoran, First Assistant Secretary, disability services program, on 1 September at Mount Eliza in Victoria. I quote from his introductory comments at that conference:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are four years into a five year formal transition period, which all would acknowledge has not fully realised the ambitions of the DSA when it was enacted in 1987. The last four years have been a valuable learning period for all the stake-holders involved. Both the Department and service providers now need to reflect openly on where we are at, and jointly on what the prospects are for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant numbers of parents and consumers continue to be concerned about the impact of the Disability Services Act on their lives, and do not clearly understand the rationale of government policy on disability services. In this regard the Department will need to pursue a more active and strategic approach to marketing the program and the benefits it offers. Fear and uncertainty are major inhibitors of development and ones which affect service providers and the Department equally critically, although in different ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The front cover of the spring edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endeavour Foundation News </EMPHASIS>from the Executive Director's desk has the following heading: `The Federal Budget&mdash;An Unexpected Disappointment'. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">August's Federal Budget has had a devastating effect on the operation of all community based service providers for the 1991/92 year.</PARA>
<PARA>The Endeavour Foundation is the largest community based charitable organisation of its type in Australia. It started in Queensland in 1951 and it provides services to some 3,000 Queenslanders with an intellectual handicap. It has 20 branches, with facilities and services at more than 180 locations. In addition, there are 36 sub-branches throughout Queensland. It has clinical support services, assessment and diagnosis services, family counselling, recreational programs and client development programs. This is what the Endeavour Foundation said about the disability support program in the Federal Budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recession has already forced organisations into a position where the emerging needs of people with an intellectual handicap are not able to be met and waiting lists for services grow longer every day. People with the highest support needs and people leaving special schools at the end of this year will be especially hard hit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Federal Budget, all organisations had their Disability Service Programme block grants slashed by 2% without warning. Endeavour's grants have been reduced by $160,000 from the amounts included in the contracts signed only two months ago. To be advised by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services that this reduction was a bureaucratic decision and not to blame the Government is just not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a further consequence to the Federal Budget, there will be no increase in the Invalid Pension this year&mdash;this will obviously affect every Client of Endeavour Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a reduction in real terms in disability funding and people may well ask whether disability is helping to pay for the new Federal initiative&mdash;the Building Better Cities Campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On top of the recession, it's all bad news for disability services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the Department's reply? The Department's reply from the under secretary is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department will need to pursue a more active and strategic approach to marketing the program.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department's reply is to market the program. How can the Minister reconcile these two separate statements? On the one hand, the disability services program is said to be answering the needs of the clients and, on the other, we have the reply from the Endeavour Foundation, the largest community based charitable organisation in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the moneys made available for the types of activities undertaken by the Endeavour Foundation have not, overall, been decreased. There has been some marginal change to indexation factors, but in fact the Government has continued to indicate its very real support for the betterment of the conditions of those with disabilities in the Australian community. That does not mean that a perfect outcome has been achieved. It is very important that governments listen to such organisations as the Endeavour Foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where critical comments have a base in either the actual delivery of services or in the policy underlying that delivery, I am quite sure that this Government will be open to persuasion that an alteration might be made. There has to be a recognition from both sides of the good faith of each side so that, on the one hand, as I say, there is a proper recognition by government of the sorts of organisations to which Senator Herron refers which deliver services to enable us to be a compassionate and just society as far as persons with disabilities are concerned, and that recognition is expressed in practical support from the Budget. With that goes a recognition that that experience ought to be listened to by government. On the other hand, it is important that these organisations also recognise that the Government, within the constraints of the moneys which taxpayers are prepared to provide, does attempt to ensure that the legitimate needs of those in the community with disabilities are met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the Estimates hearings, I asked for a copy of the most up to date figures in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service. I have since received these figures for over 50 Federal agencies for the period 1989 to 1991. Each agency collects its own figures annually by way of staff questionnaires and then provides its figures to the Public Service Commission, which collates them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) may recall that I sought and received similar figures at last year's Estimates for the years 1986 to 1989. He may also recall that virtually one year ago today the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and now Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Brian Howe, expressed his concern in relation to the declining recruitment by the Australian Public Service of people with disabilities. Mr Howe was launching the Public Service Commission's disability information strategy at the National Press Club. The Minister may remember that the Government had allocated $50,000 from last year's Budget for the development of a Public Service wide disability information strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously disgusted by the news that between 1986 and 1989 the base grade recruitment of people with disabilities by the Australian Public Service had dropped from 5.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent, Minister Howe stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regard as totally unsatisfactory the reported decline in the level of recruitment of people with disabilities into the public service. The Government cannot accept a situation where the public service is operating in a manner that is inconsistent with the broader objectives that the Government has set for the employment of people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>In this speech, Minister Howe gave a personal commitment to talk to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters,</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook, to see `what further initiatives can be taken on this issue'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I undertook an analysis of these figures of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service, broken down according to agencies, it became patently obvious that the problem to which Minister Howe was referring is occurring virtually throughout the entire Public Service. Of the 50 agencies where comparison could be made between 1986 and 1989, the proportion of total employees with disabilities had fallen in 44 of them. It had risen in only five agencies and remains static in the remaining agency. So in 44 of the 50 agencies it had declined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 December last year I issued a media release calling for immediate action to arrest this across the board decline in the employment of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service. Considering the strong rhetoric from the highly influential Minister Howe as well as his commitment to seek further remedies in consultation with Senator Cook, I thought I was not being too optimistic in believing that something might be done to improve this totally unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of these latest figures shows that, rather than improving, the situation has actually worsened in 1990 and 1991. Between</PARA>
<PARA>1989 and 1991 it was possible to undertake a comparison of the employment of people with disabilities in 54 Federal government agencies. Of these 54 agencies, 40 reported a decline in their employment of people with disabilities between 1989 and 1991. Thirteen reported an increase while one agency remained static. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the decline which has occurred between 1986 and 1991, one sees that the picture is even gloomier. Over these five years, which coincidentally are also the first five years of the implementation of the Disability Services Act, the employment of people with disabilities in the Australian Public Service has dropped in 38 of the 43 agencies in which a comparison can be made. It has risen in only four agencies and has remained static in one agency. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is at a time when the Disabilities Services Act which the Government is advocating, with the support of senators and members of this Parliament, is being implemented&mdash;implemented with a policy of ensuring that as many people as possible who are able to be placed are placed in open or supported employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the public sector is not setting the example. I think the Minister would agree that this situation becomes doubly unsatisfactory because of the Government's policy in relation to the placing of people with disabilities in open or supported employment. The objective of subprogram 4.2 which we are currently talking about is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that people with disabilities have access to, and choice of, wage generating work with job security and opportunities for job mobility and career advancement through a range of vocational services and supports.</PARA>
<PARA>An objective with which, I am sure, not one of us in this chamber would disagree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Minister Howe has stated, the disability task force realised that the bottom line for ensuring that its initiatives would be successful was to increase the access of people with disabilities to paid employment. Minister Howe has also claimed that the disability task force also recognised that the Australian Public Service would have to set an example to ensure that this occurs. It is obvious from the figures that that is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability services program's labour force and disability work force consultancy came to the same conclusion when it brought down the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Employment Initiatives for People with Disabilities</EMPHASIS> in August 1990. Recommendation 6.6 of this report called on the Commonwealth Government to explore all potential strategies in relation to the development and implementation of EEO and AA programs in both private and public sector employment, including local government, to provide full opportunities for full and equal integration into the general labour market for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultancy's Strategy Six called for a broadly based targeted access program which would be initially implemented in Commonwealth Government departments, statutory authorities and wholly owned government corporations. This targeted access program would address the needs of people with intellectual, physical or multiple disabilities to enable them to gain access to the general labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Minister that I consider the Government's absolute failure to address the continuing decline in the employment of people with disabilities by the Australian Public Service to be particularly distressing when one considers the other changes which the Government is currently making in terms of the employment of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very relevant to the issue we are discussing is the fact that on 12 November the Government's disability reform package will be implemented. From that date, disability support pensioners will have action plans drawn up for them in a concerted and welcome attempt to help them achieve mainstream employment. The labour market is depressed enough at the moment. Mr Kerin has made it official that we are in the worst recession in 60 years. People with disabilities and their families certainly do not need the added burden of knowing that the Australian Public Service is employing fewer and fewer people with disabilities every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also very relevant to the issue we are discussing are the continuing concerns that are being expressed about the implementation of the transition phase from sheltered workshops to supported and competitive employment. While I applaud the overriding objective of greater integration, it is proving very difficult to put the theory into practice. The problems are only exacerbated when the largest single employer in the country, with over 160,000 employees, is not holding up its own end of the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it bluntly, it is time that the Government realised that, in terms of the employment of people with disabilities, social justice begins at home. It begins at home in the Australian Public Service and statutory authorities. It is all well and good for Minister Howe to claim that in the development of its social justice strategy the Government has given particular attention to the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, but the Government must back up its rhetoric with action. It must get its own house in order. As I said before, social justice begins at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of questions for the Minister in relation to this important issue. Will the Minister find out what work has been done by the Deputy Prime Minister, in consultation with Senator Cook, to undertake further initiatives to improve the employment of people  with  disabilities  in  the  Australian Public Service since the launch of the Public Service Commission disability information strategy one year ago?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about this matter straight from the heart. I have not any prepared material, but I wish to compliment Senator Patterson on the very fine presentation she gave regarding people with disabilities. I also compliment Senator Herron in this regard. In Queensland I am patron of an Endeavour Foundation at Kingaroy, and I know the tremendous job that the Foundation does within our State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also a patron of the Keystone Activity Therapy Centre at Woodridge in Brisbane, a co-patron of which is the Premier's wife, Mrs Roisin Goss. We know the amount of work the centre does in that area. I have been associated with that centre for many years. I have watched the young people as they have become integrated in what is really a very big business in the Woodridge area. It is very good for the people who are there to be able to work together. They are very interested in their work. Only five or six weeks ago I had the opportunity to go to the centre to look at the different types of work it is doing. It has a printing press and many firms in Brisbane give the centre work to do. That type of work involves people working together within their own capabilities&mdash;the work force there includes deaf people&mdash;and they are being paid some wages for their work. When Keystone started the clients had to pay Keystone to get some work done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must realise that the people concerned in the centre have handicaps&mdash;they really have got problems&mdash;but the Department's theory now is that they should get out into the work force. That is all very well provided that the standards have improved so that such people are able to get into the work force. I understand from Keystone that of 70 clients, only three have had enough ability to be able to go out and compete in the work force. The proposition seems silly when even people who are fit and well at present in this country cannot get jobs. But the Department is suggesting that people with disabilities can go out and compete in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that the idea is quite all right, but I do not know how it can be done in practice. The Department is trying to put in place a very difficult process. I also think about the position of the carers of these people, as well as the parents at home, who will find the idea difficult to accept. They care for young people who have handicaps and who are unable to manage as well in the work force as people who have all their abilities; although sometimes employers might say that people who have all their abilities are not 100 per cent in the work force, but that is by the way. Certainly the parents and carers of these people must worry considerably about what will happen to these young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Director of Keystone is doing a fantastic job and that the centre is developing in many different areas. It does woodwork, makes trophies and there are wonderfully capable workers in the organisation, but I believe that they are capable in the area in which they are able to work. To put them out into the broad spectrum of the work force will not help people with disabilities. When they have work to do that is within their capabilities and in which they know their limitations, when they also know the people with whom they work and with whom they have been associated for many years, that is a different matter. But the Department's plan is too ambitious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in Queensland the Department has told the Keystone Activity Therapy Centre and indeed the Endeavour Therapy Foundation that they have to put people into the work force, but the Department itself is not willing to employ people who have handicaps. This is quite wrong. The executive director wrote a letter, to which I added an endorsement, to the Department saying that if the Department is so willing to make these suggestions it should be willing to take action itself and provide some job opportunities. So far, although the Department in Queensland talks about it, it has not been willing to take any action in this regard. This needs to be brought to the Department's attention. If the Department is asking other employers to take on people with disabilities, I believe that the Department itself should also be willing to give an example to other employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Endeavour Foundation in Kingaroy, of which I am patron, I have watched the people there make the most marvellous biscuits. Indeed, I think that perhaps they could set up a business, and indeed make some pumpkin scones as well to go with them. They have a wonderful clientele who buy biscuits regularly from the centre. The people there take in ironing, and indeed one of my daughters is a customer. They have opportunities to do these things, but to do them within their own area of ability. They are helped and trained by the wonderful people in the Endeavour Foundation and in activity therapy centres&mdash;not only the centre in Woodridge but also in various other activity centres in Brisbane and throughout the State. It is important that the Department keeps that in mind for people with handicaps who need assistance and also for their carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are just some of the things I want to speak about from my heart today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was inspired by Senator Bjelke-Petersen's address from the heart. I, too, wish to speak from the heart. I have had experience over 32 years with disability services, in that my eldest daughter has an intellectual handicap. I am appalled at what I see occurring with the Disability Services Act. Two weeks ago I was at Help Industries at New Farm, which looks after 160 people with disabilities. It is governed by a board of retired businessmen and is basically self-supporting. To give an example of what the people there are capable of, they have developed a machine which assembles clothes pegs. This machine is the first of its type in the world. They have a patent on it and in fact they have negotiated and sold one of these machines to Japan. This machine was developed by one of the businessmen as a result of him seeing the rows of people with intellectual handicaps putting together clothes pegs and thinking that there must be a better way of doing it. So he designed this machine and it has been put into effect. It was built on the premises and a world patent has been granted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Services Act and the Department that controls it wants to close down Help Industries. It is an absurdity. The clients who go there are developed to the maximum of their ability. They are encouraged to go out into the work force. I asked at the Estimates Committee hearing a year ago whether the director of the program had been to inspect Help Industries at New Farm. The answer was no. I was there two weeks ago and the answer was still no. The boffins in Canberra have not deigned to go and see one of the most effective and useful enterprises in this country. The local people have been to see it, but the mandarins in the citadel have not bothered to go and see it. That is one example. The effect of the Disability Services Act will be to close that down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another centre in Brisbane called the Mercy Centre. It has attached to it a commercially effective laundry. In fact, it had the laundry contract to look after the linen for the railways in Queensland. It is staffed primarily by intellectually handicapped women, and a large number of them live on the premises. The effect of the Disability Services Act is that it will not allow what is called backfilling. The way that term is used in the nomenclature sounds as though we are filling in a pothole, but that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, namely, that if any of the elderly ladies there, or the young ones for that matter, leave the Mercy Centre the nuns are not allowed to fill that position with someone coming onto the premises. They have to be placed somewhere off the premises, and the Mercy Centre has bought houses in the area so that some of these disabled people can live together in groups of four. Social workers come in and take care of them from nine to five Monday to Friday. One can imagine what occurs out of hours and at weekends with severely intellectually handicapped people. There is not the tender loving care on the part of the volunteers or the nuns to look after them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the way in which the Disability Services Act is being administered. It is all very well to have highfalutin ideas and aims. No-one would disagree with them. It is like disagreeing with motherhood. Of course we want these people to achieve their objectives and to be absorbed into the community, but it ignores the reality of the severe intellectually handicapped&mdash;some like my daughter who cannot speak&mdash;of whom people are saying they should be trained and sent into the work force. It is absurd. I would like the mandarins and the boffins in this sheltered environment, this sheltered workshop of Canberra, to go out into the community and see what is being done by these organisations that are looking after the people and caring for them with that four-letter word&mdash;which is not understood by the mandarins and boffins of Canberra&mdash;`love'. It is not understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a cost containment exercise. It is an attempt to shift onto the community people who are incapable of surviving in the community. Senator Patterson has demonstrated the hypocrisy of the whole system when, with all these highfalutin ideas and all the statements about wanting to do what is best for the community, the Department has a mote in its own eye. It cannot even employ people with severe disabilities&mdash;or with any disability. The numbers in employment are decreasing, as Senator Patterson has shown with the figures that she produced. That is the hypocrisy of the system and I would like the Minister to respond to this point, which was also raised by Senator Harradine and by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. What is the response to the facts that have been produced by Senator Patterson?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, it has been made clear that there is no intention on the part of the Government to close down or defund those projects which cannot meet what has been considered to be a proper objective. If that cannot be met, then the organisation concerned will still receive funding for the provision of its services, as long as there is an observation by that organisation of the standards which are expected and which ordinarily are achieved and achieved well above the minimum stipulations set down in the various documents put out by the Department relating to the human rights of the clients of these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to agree with much of what has been put to the Committee about the very grave difficulty of putting this objective as though it were able to be practically implemented in a fairly ready way when quite clearly the experience is that it cannot be. Senator Patterson's major matter of concern, in a very full presentation&mdash;and I am glad that she delivered it in a fairly slow and measured way so that I could pick up some of the figures, which is her normal way of addressing the chamber&mdash;was to point out quite rightly that there has been a slight overall decrease in the number of staff with disabilities employed within the Australian Public Service. That has to be recognised&mdash;it is a fact&mdash;and Senator Patterson has put that into a form which highlights that fact. One of the difficulties that has to be recognised in using these figures, and the matter of whether a person in the Australian Public Service is categorised properly as being disabled, is a question for that person. In other words, it is a question of self-identification. It may be&mdash;I just say `may be'; I am not saying that this would make a huge difference to the figures&mdash;that there are some people in the Australian Public Service who do not wish to identify themselves as being disabled. I suppose they might be at the end of the spectrum, which would indicate that they have a less severe disability than some others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was only mentioning that as one factor, and I conceded it was a very minor one. The fact is that there will be people within the Australian Public Service who might otherwise be objectively described as disabled but who have not identified themselves as such. It is as simple as that. But the real point is that there has been an decrease&mdash;there is no doubt about that. In part, it can be attributed to an overall reduction in the number of base level staff due to the restructuring of departments and streamlining of functions at lower levels, the reduction in suitable jobs due to technological change and multiskilling, and limited regional APS job opportunities due to concentration of the Commonwealth Public Service primarily in capital cities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister said that there had been a reduction in the Public Service and this was one of the excuses put forward for the reduction in the lower grades. We have just had an increase of 4,000 public servants, as the Minister would be well aware, because there have been numerous criticisms, certainly from the Opposition, that we need an increase in employment in the private sector too, and that the recovery should not really be just led by public servants. Apart from that fact, if there had been an increase of 4,000 public servants I imagine that there would have been an increase in the number of disabled, even in the lower strata.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Minister missed a point I think Senator Herron particularly made, and that was that the Department will not close institutions that are badly needed by the profoundly disabled. I am not quite sure what description the Department puts on that because I and other members of a Senate committee which is presently looking at this matter are finding difficulty with the description of some disabled who are unable to be employed. But the Minister ignored completely that ability, which Senator Herron pointed out the Department has refused to acknowledge, to allow backfilling. So these institutions that care for the profoundly disabled are not allowed to backfill&mdash; to put someone in who is presently coming up through the school system or through the system. We have profoundly disabled people arriving at the doorstep every day who have not previously needed care but now do. The Government is not permitting the backfilling of those institutions. Therefore, this is a problem which all the institutions bring to us and which must be addressed by the Government. </PARA>

That is the sort of thing that all of us on both sides of this chamber would be expecting from the departments which are implementing a government policy of putting people into open employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we say there has been a decrease, each one of those figures is an individual; each one is a person. As I moved around Victoria going to sheltered workshop after sheltered workshop, some expressed their desire to remain in those workshops and a number expressed their desire to go into open employment. If they are to go into open employment, then the Public Service and statutory authorities ought to be setting the example. We ought to be seeing by now first-class enclaves really working and demonstrating and setting an example to the private sector of what can be done. The only evidence I have seen of that was last week when I visited the Portland aluminium smelter. It is in the process of setting up an enclave for 10 people from the school for intellectually handicapped. The company itself, in conjunction with that school, is undertaking some of the work being done at that school at the smelter itself by incorporating those people. There is a whole program being set up to ensure that the staff are prepared and ready to accept those people as they come in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that it is a difficult task to do that and we must prepare the work force to accept those people as they come in.

We were assured that this multiskilling would not affect the opportunities for employment of persons with disabilities. Now the Government is telling us that that is one of the reasons for the decline in the number of persons with disabilities employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. The Government would have it both ways. If that is the advice that has been given to the Government by the Department of Social Security, it had better look at Senator Cook's Department which was supposed to ensure that multiskilling did not have that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to another question. We have to look at the whole area of disability services in the broad.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to my State of Tasmania and to a former electorate officer, Mr Phil Vincent, who is now an employee of a Commonwealth department in Tasmania. Mr Vincent is a cerebral palsy sufferer. He has pointed out that what is to take place in Tasmania is a further discrimination against, a further barrier to, persons with disabilities gaining employment. The State Minister for Community Services, Mrs Judy Jackson, has indicated that there will be a change as from 1 November to what is now known as the transport access scheme, formerly known as the transport and parking concession scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a report in the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 30 October 1991 and to what Mr Vincent said in that report. It is very important that the Minister, the Department and the Committee know, when considering whether the allocation that is before us is appropriate, that from 1 November, I think, the Federal Government's disability allowance is to be increased from $11 a week to $20 a week for persons who are working. From that date, the Tasmanian Government has imposed a means test on its scheme. That means test will result in employed persons with disabilities virtually being prevented from receiving the amount of allowance that they received under the original transport and parking concession scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Vincent said in the report that the Government would not consider someone for the scheme until that person gave up his or her job and went back on an allowance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Vincent said the changes would discourage disabled people from looking for full-time jobs, make it extremely expensive for them to get to work and stop many from doing their own shopping and going out socially.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter with the Minister which I do not think has received attention as yet, and I think it should. It relates to the Baume review recommendations concerning the exchange of evaluation reports and the acceptance of evaluations in certain other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I preface my remarks by pointing out to the Minister that in this area we should appreciate that there needs to be considerable caution. We need to recognise the enormous financial interest that international drug companies have in ensuring the rapid spread, as it were, the rapid sale, of their products. Quite clearly, they are most interested in obtaining approval for their product. It is absolutely essential in whatever we do in this area, whatever the Department does in this area, always to have that aspect in the forefront of our minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer as an example to the drug Depo-Provera in the contraceptive area. The particular manufacturer was very keen to promote this drug. Indeed, when the conference was called in 1981 by the World Health Organisation's HRP program coordinating committee, the manufacturer was amongst those who were making recommendations for the drug's approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the toxicology review panel on that occasion, the first name one sees is Professor Michael Briggs. The Committee may recall that it was Professor Briggs who was found to have falsified information relating to the ill effects of the contraceptive pill in research he was doing. That research was being paid for by the American manufacturer of the pill. Frankly, I do not think Deakin University has recovered from that scandal. It should be well and truly in the forefront of our minds that manufacturing companies, certain drug companies, will do almost anything to ensure that their drugs are approved. In the Baume report, the Commonwealth Medical Officers Association comments on page 5:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unwise to assume that foreign regulatory agencies do not have any bias in favour of their own local manufacturing industry and that proper scrutiny of the scientific validity of processes will occur in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Association is aware of this aspect. I turn now to the specific indications of this report. On pages 22 and 23, under the heading `Evaluation', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of the recent reviews of drug evaluation in Australia have recommended the exchange of evaluation reports with countries of similar standards. The PSB review stated:  given the high level of success the Australian regulatory authorities have had in recent years, the team would be reluctant to see marketing approval granted automatically on the basis of approvals granted in other countries. However, there do appear to be opportunities available to reduce workloads over the longer term through the exchange of evaluations with those countries with a similar industry structure, population and regulatory standards as ours. Sweden and Canada would seem to fit these criteria best.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 25 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Alex Proudfoot, Principal Medical Adviser of the TGA, is on record as stating that the Swedish agency has lower standards of clinical evaluation than Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It is significant that the Committee should understand that here is a situation which gives a cautionary note. Overall the report seems to promote the view that there should be an agreement between, for example, Australia and Canada, and presumably Sweden and certain other countries. I ask the Minister: what, in effect, will be the result of such an agreement? Would it mean that the approval of the drugs in those countries would result in automatic approval in Australia and, if not, what further conditions would apply? I also ask the Minister to detail to the Committee whether any representatives from Australia will be attending the drug harmonisation conference which is taking place this month in Europe. If so, what briefings will those officers have? Is the Minister aware that this drug harmonisation conference is very strenuously supported by the international major drug manufacturing industries?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my habit to say in the Senate at Question Time what the Cabinet is considering in relation to particular matters. For example, the question of new taxing powers and the guaranteed share of income are matters which have been put on the table, or are likely to be put on the table, by the States at the Premiers Conference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to reports this morning that Serbia has again, during the latest round of the peace conference in The Hague, rejected the European peace plan for Yugoslavia.  What are the prospects now for Lord Carrington's efforts in light of this latest development? What is the Australian Government's response to the Serbian attitude? What is the current assessment by our Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2527" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear that the efforts that have been made to achieve a negotiated and comprehensive settlement are at a rather critical point at this stage. As Senator Loosely has noted, Serbia did again reject the European peace plan when the peace conference run by the Europeans in The Hague convened last night our time. That plan proposed to transform Yugoslavia into a loose grouping of six republics and had been supported&mdash;or at least not opposed&mdash;by the five republics other than Serbia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In rejecting the plan as it did last night, Serbia is understood to have proposed instead a plan for border changes within Yugoslavia that would have allowed Serbian minorities in other republics to take their territory with them into a redefined and Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation. The Republic of Montenegro seems now to have supported that Serbian proposal, whereas previously it had not opposed the EC plan. But it was rejected by the other republics, not least for the serious implications it would have had for their current territorial status. So there does seem to be an impasse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the break-up of yesterday's round of talks, at which Serbia and Croatia did agree on yet another cease-fire, Lord Carrington warned participants in the conference that if that cease-fire failed to hold he proposed that next Friday&mdash;that is, in a couple of days time&mdash;the conference be adjourned indefinitely. EC Foreign Ministers indicated a couple of days ago, on 4 November, that economic sanctions against Serbia would be considered on Friday, when Lord Carrington is due to report to them, if there was a continuation of the refusal to endorse the peace plan. I understand that EC Ministers are now looking at the possible suspension or termination of the benefits under various bilateral agreements which presently exist between EC and Yugoslavia and, specifically, the possibility of an oil embargo. Of course, that may well be the most effective form of sanction because, whereas Croatia has some domestic oil production capacity, Serbia is almost wholly dependent on oil imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to our governmental reaction, we have consistently and repeatedly made known, both in public statements and in direct communications to the Europeans, our support for the EC peace efforts. There is no doubt in the minds of European leaders of Australia's support. While we are obviously not a party principal to the negotiations in The Hague, we do of course support any peace proposal which is agreed to by the parties directly involved. No such plan should be allowed to founder on the basis of rejection by one republic&mdash;or two republics if one brings Montenegro into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the EC is essentially looking for from Australia and other like-minded countries are supportive measures. I indicate again, as I did yesterday, that the Australian Government stands ready to participate in any measures in line with those being considered by the EC or the UN Security Council. The Government's position is also well-known to the parties on the ground. Our Embassy has consistently made our views known directly to the Serbian authorities. But, in case there is any misunderstanding at all in light of the latest developments, I have this morning instructed our Ambassador in Belgrade to make quite clear, yet again, that we firmly believe that a solution to the situation in Yugoslavia must involve compromise by all the parties involved&mdash;in particular right now, the Serbs&mdash;and that we are deeply concerned at Serbia's rejection of the EC peace plan and will have no option but to support international sanctions against Yugoslavia if they are put in place. We will also, of course, keep the Europeans up to date with our reaction, as we have done consistently until now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again I refer the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support to Mr David Lockwood's wind analyses of the proposed operation of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport with a third runway. Mr Lockwood estimates that downwinds, as distinct from cross-winds, which were covered in the Minister's last answer on this subject, will require 23 per cent of traffic on the north-south runways to operate in a northerly direction. Is this estimate double the estimate in the EIS? Does Mr Lockwood's analysis also show that cross-winds will require the east-west runway to be used by 1.9 per cent of traffic&mdash;much more than the 1.2 per cent estimate in the EIS? If Mr Lockwood's analysis is correct, would the 2,000 diversions of large aircraft away from Sydney each year as a result of downgrading the east-west runway be acceptable? Finally, do the predicted reductions in numbers of people affected by noise, previously quoted by the Minister from the EIS, depend on the accuracy of the EIS estimates of both usage of the east-west runway and direction of traffic on the north-south runways?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is all right then. I did say in that answer on 16 October that I would meet with Mr Lockwood. I subsequently did so, and I also met a number of other people who were with him. Arising from that meeting, I arranged for Mr Lockwood to have complete access to any civil aviation officers he wanted to speak to so as to check the accuracy of his information. He did that. Mr Lockwood met with officers of the Department in Sydney on 28 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reassert the fundamental flaw in Mr Lockwood's analysis. He has set up an entirely theoretical model based on his experience of meteorological matters. In the past, Mr Lockwood has been the director of marine policy for the New South Wales Department of the Environment. I do not dispute that he knows a great deal about wind, but he knows nothing about the operations of an airport. As I said on 16 October, and I reassert that it is important, the EIS is based on actual meteorological observations from the tower at Sydney Airport, not on a theoretical model, as Mr Lockwood's work is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lockwood met with officers on 28 October. It was explained to him that the criteria of five-knot tail winds and 25-knot cross-winds for runway usage are well below the safe operating limits of most modern aircraft. It was also explained that the pilot is ultimately responsible for deciding what operation is safe and that air traffic control does not direct pilots to use runways if the pilots have doubts about the safety of the operation. The pilot is in command. Mr Lockwood's assertion about safety being prejudiced by CAA cross-wind criteria for runway selection is therefore entirely unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATC also explained to Mr Lockwood how wind velocity is observed at the airport and used to decide which runways will be utilised. He was presented with 10 years of data collected from the control tower that show an actual long term useability of the north-south runway of 84 per cent, which is significantly higher than the theoretical figure of 76.8 per cent asserted by Mr Lockwood. This shows the danger&mdash;and I stress it again&mdash;of relying on theoretical assessments that totally ignore the actual operating conditions of the airport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS>. The EIS is based on actual rather than theoretical observations. Mr Lockwood was also given four years of data relating to the times the cross-wind runway was used when weather conditions precluded the use of the main north-south runway. I would have thought that that was the most fundamental piece of information on which to rely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the years 1987 to 1989, 3,392 aircraft per year&mdash;that is, 1.7 per cent&mdash;utilised the east-west runway when the cross-wind, including gusts, on the north-south runway exceeded 20 knots. However, under the new procedures, aircraft use the east-west runway when the cross-wind, including gusts, exceeds 25 knots. That is because of the additional capacity of modern aircraft. In 1990, this meant that 1,178 aircraft&mdash;that is, 0.2 per cent&mdash;used the east-west runway. These actual figures are substantially lower than the theoretical figures Mr Lockwood asserts are likely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data collected at the airport casts substantial doubt on the value of a very theoretical study done with no appreciation of the practice of airport operations. Far from confirming Mr Lockwood's findings, they show the study to be totally out of touch with reality. It should be noted that the proposal by the FAC eventually to reduce the operational length of the east-west runway will occur only if the airline industry is in agreement, and it will occur beyond 2010 when alternative runway capacity is available at Badgerys Creek on those limited occasions when there may be excessive cross-winds at Kingsford-Smith.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information we have obtained from these various sources is inconclusive. The official military account is that the deaths occurred in the context of a fight between Timorese groups outside the church&mdash;which may have had something to do with a fight between supporters and opponents of integration&mdash;and that two people died in the incident in question. A number of eyewitness accounts suggest that shots were fired.

If information sharing from the bases is extended, would Australia have power of veto if, for example, the Soviet Union decided to use its missile capability against one of its own republics in the event of internal conflict? Further, does the current proposal with the Soviet Union extend to the British, the French and the Chinese, along with other countries concerned about proliferation of ballistic missiles?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray answered a question yesterday on this subject in terms which indicated that, although some information sharing in relation to information derived from these facilities might be in contemplation as part of the general approach to these matters in the aftermath of the Bush and Gorbachev statements, that has not been specifically pursued yet and, if it is pursued, it will be in consultation with us. The Americans have made that perfectly clear. It is premature to embark on a kind of speculative extravaganza about the various contexts in which information might be shared in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

It provided advice on workplace bargaining which ensures that there is no discrimination when we move to that area of bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newsletter referred to in the question is published by the unit. It addresses a couple of important key matters. First, it shows that women's rates of pay have increased at a faster rate than men's in recent years. This is due in part to the minimum rates adjustment process that this Government supported in previous national wage case decisions. It means that women can be evaluated on the basis of skill, competence and responsibility whereas in the past those assets may not have been properly evaluated in the pay setting approach. Unfortunately, it also shows, however, that average weekly earnings for full time females employed in the work force are still only 81 per cent of average weekly earnings for full time males employed in the work force.</PARA>

This mill would not be entering the world paper market for at least four years, even if the assessment process were begun now. So the current state of the world market is not of particular relevance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can in fact confirm that recently there was a very constructive meeting held in Melbourne of the Australian police Ministers which enabled Ministers from all jurisdictions to put aside political differences, which seems to be an inheritance of this Commonwealth deriving from the States and Territories having borders which can at times lead to different laws in relation to such an important matter as gun control throughout Australia. I believe Senator Gerry Jones has been a persistent asker of questions on this subject, asking very constructive and creative questions on this matter, and that is why I am able to surmise the type of question the honourable senator was asking. It would relate to the police Ministers conference which made it very clear that we are changing the philosophy of the ownership of guns in this society. That is to say, the possession of guns and firearms in this society is a privilege and not a right. This is a very fundamental philosophical point agreed upon by all Ministers and which has enabled us to establish a common position on licensing of firearms throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

That question of continuous rosters for underground mining is a matter for the Western Australian Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many very well informed views about the potential use of magnesium metal for environmental reasons, particularly in industries such as the international motor vehicle industry. Magnesium is a strong but very light metal which will be increasingly used by industries such as the Japanese and European automotive industries for structural components in cars. It is lighter and it has beneficial environmental effects in terms of lower fuel usage, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as Australia is concerned, there are outstanding deposits of magnesite ore which constitutes the raw material from which magnesium metals are produced. The CSIRO, in conjunction with some others, has been for some time involved in research into the process for making magnesium metals. The current methods employed overseas have been unavailable to Australia because of the control of the technology by a major company in the United States and a major company in Europe. Therefore, if Australia is to obtain the benefits of adding value to the resources it has, it is very important that the research work of CSIRO, in conjunction with three companies, be carried forward to the pilot plant stage. Because of this situation, the Government has recently made a decision to support CSIRO in the development of an appropriate pilot plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential issues are the capacity to develop a value added industry based on a very important raw material, a resource.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the bases of the Government's recently made decision. There are other reasons for it as well. The question appropriately comes from a Queensland senator because the deposit is located near Rockhampton and some of the work has been carried out in Gladstone.

This is a very encouraging prospect for north Queensland and for a major future industrial development in Australia.</PARA>

I am pleased to say that governments around Australia, including at long last the Northern Territory Government, which originally opposed this proposal on the astonishing ground of cost, have now indicated their intention to introduce legislation to require the carriage of these devices. They have saved 157 lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far back as July 1988, State and Territory transport Ministers agreed in principle to legislate for mandatory carriage of EPIRBs, provided the Federal Government installed the ground terminal to access the satellite monitoring system.

I am pleased to say that at this stage most States are now close to implementing the legislation. As I noted, even the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works, Mr Fred Finch, who originally opposed this proposal on the ground of unreasonable cost to the boat owners, has in the past few weeks indicated a change of heart on the part of the Northern Territory Government and has indicated that his Government will now legislate for the mandatory carriage of EPIRBs.

<PARA>I thank the Senate for giving me this opportunity. I raise the matter at this time because it is of vital importance. The Federal Government has now stepped back from its willingness to give the States a new capacity to raise taxes, which of course was linked with the promotion by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of new federalism as part of an important structural reform resulting in greater efficiencies for Australia. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) might yawn. I suspect that is the attitude of the Government to this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, are you going to give me any protection? Mr Hawke was prepared to advance this as the flagship of his fourth term in office&mdash;this new federalism, the new relationship between the States and the Commonwealth that would break down the structural inefficiencies that have existed for so long. He promoted it, and he promoted it after the July Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What changed? The change occurred on 22 October, when Mr Keating, taking the opportunity of the Prime Minister being out of the country, decided to weigh in and attack the Prime Minister's position. Mr Keating did so, describing the Prime Minister's position as a disaster. At the National Press Club he said that it would gut the Commonwealth. The following day Mr Keating took up the favourite commentator's program, that of John Laws, and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . federalism is a very broad label, there is a sense of rationalisation of functions but there is no sense in giving revenue back to the States, none.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this change will go on to haunt Australia forever, that is developing six fully resourced State Governments able to rely on their residual powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the threshold of us re-entering the big international scene and the big international debate and the international world of commerce we chop Australia into six governments. I mean, it is just not a goer in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That position happened to be the one Mr Keating had taken at previous Premiers Conferences when he was Treasurer. He has clearly been long opposed to the issue of either transferring new taxation powers to the States to overcome this vertical fiscal imbalance or, alternatively, looking at a sharing of taxation powers. While he was Treasurer, it could not occur. When Mr Keating was gone, for a moment or two both the Prime Minister and Mr Kerin had the courage to advance it. Then Mr Keating came out and made it part of the leadership issue. The sequence of events logically followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a few days later Mr Keating again lifted the pain and went on to attack a suggestion that the Prime Minister might adopt Premier Kirner's requirement of a statement on jobs. Mr Keating advanced the heat by saying that what Australia needed, in his view, was an immediate one per cent interest rate cut, an incentive plan to generate new production, more help for long term employment, et cetera.

We saw an example of it again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three times Senator Button was given the opportunity to say, `I support the Prime Minister', and refused to do so. Senator Richardson was also given the opportunity. Whilst Minister Dawkins and Minister Richardson undermine the Prime Minister and whilst Senator Button is not prepared to stand up and say that he supports the Prime Minister, it is not surprising that the Prime Minister himself does not have the guts to make any positive decisions, because he is on the edge of the end of his reign as leader. The numbers are being counted. You know, Mr Deputy President, that they were being counted again in this place last night. There is no doubt that eventually Mr Keating will wear him down. There is no doubt about that at all. It is a process of exhaustion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell the Senate why the issue is important. Whilst the Leader of the Government in the Senate got up today and said that he is not prepared to tell the Senate whether the Federal Government now has a position on tax sharing, the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was ringing around State Premiers confirming to them that the Commonwealth has no position&mdash;going one step further; in fact withdrawing the communique group that was supposed to meet to draft the communique for the forthcoming Premiers Conference because the Commonwealth's position is changing. Why has the Commonwealth's position changed? It has changed because of the leadership crisis and the paralysis that that has brought upon this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said the undermining is not only in the organisation, not only in the back bench, but also in the Cabinet, which reminds me of the next event in this unholy sequence of events. That was the former ALP national president and Queensland Deputy Premier, Tom Burns, coming into the act on 3 November. He attacked Mr Keating; he said he was sick of the disloyalty of Mr Keating. What did he say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal president in my day would have rung him and said: `Mate, you are stepping out of line'.</PARA>
<PARA>He would have stopped him. Who is the Federal President of the Labor Party? Senator Loosely. Would he do that? Of course not. He cannot do that. He came out instead defending Mr Keating. He defended the right to comment, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the task of the President to make certain that people in the ALP have an opportunity to argue ideas in the forums of the party.</PARA>
<PARA>Would he have done that with anyone other than Mr Keating, the person he is supporting to be Prime Minister of this country?  What did Senator Richardson come out and say when Burns, one should have thought quite reasonably, was saying that it was time that Mr Keating was brought into line? Senator Richardson, a member of Mr Hawke's Cabinet, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Tommy's said that, Tommy's wrong. Then again, that would not be the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any form of public dispute can damage the party. Having said that Mr Keating is also of the view that unemployment is damaging the party.</PARA>
<PARA>So we had both campaign managers for Mr Keating&mdash;a member of Mr Hawke's own Cabinet, Senator Richardson, and the Federal President of the ALP, Senator Loosely&mdash;standing up for Keating and in effect saying that he has the right to undermine the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened then, of course, is that this Monday we had the Caucus meeting on new federalism. Prime Minister Hawke was drawn before his own people to explain his ever-changing position on tax sharing. As a result of that, we read in the press&mdash;and it has not been disputed&mdash;that Mr Hawke backs away from the undertaking he gave to the Premiers at the July conference. He now backs away from the undertaking to give them a new share of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the reaction of the Premiers? The reaction of both Premier Carmen Lawrence from Western Australia and Premier Bannon from South Australia was to condemn him. Carmen Lawrence acknowledges that the issue of new federalism, the sharing of tax, is now linked to the leadership issue. She recognised that that was what forced Prime Minister Hawke to draw back from his previous position. What did Premier Bannon say? He said that, unless the Commonwealth is prepared to return to its previous position and seriously give the opportunity for the States to take these new taxing powers, or at least to share these new taxing powers, the conference might as well not be held at all. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, Mr Hawke is again giving himself the out. In other words, being pressed now by the Premiers, he changes his position again and says, `Yes, we will look at a sharing of taxes but I give myself the out by saying to the State Premiers that there are many theoretical and practical difficulties'. So it is not surprising that the Premiers are angry. It is not surprising that the Party is angry.

Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate&mdash;the third most senior Minister&mdash;refused to condemn the man whose existence is now devoted wholly and solely to destabilising the Government of which Senator Button is such a senior figure. He refused to condemn the man who is blatantly, openly, deliberately and arrogantly devoting himself to pulling down, to overthrowing, his Prime Minister&mdash;the Prime Minister of this nation.

It was a reshaping that the Prime Minister launched with great bravado in July of last year&mdash;only 16 months ago. He announced&mdash;and we welcomed&mdash;a series of Special Premiers Conferences to reshape this nation and the relationship between the Commonwealth and State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a reshaping that looked as though it was going fairly well, until 23 October. What happened on 23 October? Paul Keating got up and made a speech saying that he did not like what was happening. What happened? Within 10 days this Government completely reversed thrust on what it had been saying was the move towards the most important reform in Federal-State relations in our history. Every Australian will suffer grievously from that absolute back flip, that absolute 180 degrees turnaround by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the Government done that, but it has further exposed just how little people can believe what the Prime Minister says, even in this Parliament. Yesterday in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister said that he did not know of any proposals by the States to have income tax sharing arrangements of any description, or any hand back of income taxing powers to the States, to be put forward at the Perth Special Premiers Conference at the end of this month. We know that that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premiers met last week in Adelaide and virtually agreed on a piece of paper which sets out those proposals in detail. The Prime Minister has been advised; he knows the content of that paper. Indeed, Premiers Bannon and Greiner have an arrangement to meet the Prime Minister this Friday after the EPAC meeting to formally give him the paper that he informally knows the content of already. That paper includes unanimous, specific proposals for handing back to the States a share of the income taxing powers of this nation, with an initial proposal that it be 6 per cent. That would bring to the States a measure of revenue of approximately $10 billion, which would go an enormous way to correcting the so-called vertical fiscal imbalance, the mishmash between expenditure and revenue responsibilities, as between the Commonwealth and the States. It is known and universally accepted as one of the major problems in achieving efficient government and efficient division of responsibilities in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Prime Minister said that he did not know anything about that at all. That&mdash;I have to be careful not to be unparliamentary&mdash;is not the truth. Today in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister refused again to acknowledge any knowledge of that. The point is that this continual misleading&mdash;deliberately or otherwise&mdash;of the Australian people, this continual dissembling to the Australian people, is due to a lack of leadership in this nation. It is due to great destructive, vicious divisions within the Government, which are leading to a total policy paralysis. Every Australian suffers as a result. </PARA>

Not just I, but my colleagues on this side, have asked very serious questions about the state of the nation, the state of the economy, the state of all the other areas of concern in this nation.

As a result, the one million unemployed, the other Australians who fear for their own jobs and their own economic welfare, are indeed being betrayed by somebody's simple wilful ambition to take over the leadership of the Australian Labor Party for the withering days of power that are left until we get to the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, Mr Deputy President, if you have a good look at the Standing Orders, at page 42 you will see that during Question Time questions may be put to Ministers relating to public affairs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look further at what has happened because of this lack of leadership. There is an endeavour to turn many people in our society into welfare recipients. We have seen the recent announcements with regard to the rural adjustment authority and what is occurring there. That is all about lack of leadership. It is about an ex-Treasurer, trying to become a Prime Minister, who is incapable of being a Prime Minister and who, in fact, was incapable of being a successful Treasurer. He created a lot of misery for our country. But we now find a situation where that very same man who wrought misery on so many people in this country is undermining the Prime Minister. We also see that the Ministers and the people who sit on the other side of this chamber will not stand up and support the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We cannot say much for the Government of Queensland and the people who run it, but at least we can say that little Tommy Burns was prepared to get up and support Mr Hawke and tell Mr Keating, if I quote him correctly, to shut up. At least Mr Burns was prepared to do that. No-one on the other side is prepared to stand up and support the current Leader. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) was given three opportunities to support Mr Hawke, but not once did he take up the opportunity. Senator Evans, one of the senior people in the Government, was given the opportunity, but he did not take it up. Of the few others who are sitting around&mdash;some of them supposedly Hawke supporters&mdash;not one of them is prepared to get up and support Mr Hawke. They interject and carry on about other people talking, but they are not game, they are not prepared, to get up and speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw Senator Maguire come in, and I am waiting for Senator Cooney to appear. The Government usually trots them out when it has a difficult task for someone, some function that nobody else in the Labor Party is game to carry out. The Government trots out Senator Maguire and Senator Cooney to come in and support it. But not even Senator Maguire is getting to his feet to support his Leader. At least in Queensland Mr Burns is prepared to support his convictions, but one might think that he is not doing it with a tremendous amount of altruism. One may think that possibly it is all part of the grubby little deals going on in Queensland at the moment for preselections that are directly related to the inertia that is affecting this Government because of the challenge between Mr Keating and Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> that perhaps Mr Burns's idea in telling Mr Keating to shut up really meant more about entrenching the Right-Left coalition in the Queensland ALP than anything else. As I understand it, there is a move afoot to try to get the numbers to take away the endorsement of Mr Gary Johns, the honourable member for Petrie, because he is a supporter of Mr Keating. He is in the wrong faction, as I understand it, whatever the factions are in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Johns was warned last time by the Queensland bully boys&mdash;including Mr Ludwig&mdash;when they came down and got the Queensland ALP people to toe the line. Mr Johns went the other way and was prepared to support Mr Keating. He was warned then, to such an extent that the matter came before the central executive meeting of the ALP in Canberra. It had to try to protect Mr Johns and let him have the freedom to support the candidate of his choice without being stood on or blackmailed or bullied by the factions that control the Queensland ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe I am giving Mr Burns too much credit when I say that at least he had the courage of his convictions. Maybe it is part of that plot to grind Mr Keating into the ground, to grind into the ground anyone in Queensland who might dare confront the powers that presently control the Queensland ALP. Whatever it is, those people in Queensland are prepared to get up and say and do something to support the man they claim to follow.

<PARA>In speaking to the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women &amp; TAFE&mdash;A National Plan of Action</EMPHASIS>, I point out that the issues affecting women's training and participation in the work force need to be addressed within award restructuring and workplace reorganisation. As the report says, women continue to experience disadvantage in the labour market. They make up some 41.6 per cent of the work force; 39.5 per cent of women workers have part time jobs which are often casual. They are concentrated in a small number of occupations at the bottom of the employment hierarchy. This is reflected in the pattern of women's participation in TAFE. This is a very well put together paper. I believe that it should be recommended reading for members of the Senate. It is a very well presented document. </PARA>

It covers two full pages but says almost nothing. What is the reality? There are several paragraphs entitled `Fee Relief'. What does it really mean? It means that this Government has reduced fee relief for the very people wanting to use the TAFE courses. Occasional care is what is needed by most women undertaking TAFE courses, and this Government is reducing the amount of fee relief available to them. So much for having paragraphs on fee relief in this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the Senate's attention to the funding of child-care and the child-care funds provision under the JET scheme, which is being used by many women undertaking TAFE courses who are sole parents. Last year the JET scheme handed back $2m in unspent child-care funding. Representatives from the scheme told the Senate Estimates Committee that there was no demand, yet sole parents tell me that they are being turned back from access to child-care under the JET scheme because there is no money.

It is intended that these changes come into place on 1 February next year, and that date is being aimed for. If the software company incorporates these changes in the normal way in which it updates the programs, there is no problem. If there is a problem, we can discuss the question of the cost of updating or changing the programs with the Government.

There would be regular block payments which would not be directly linked to the number of services provided. There could be a core practice grant which would supplement the fee for service income of the practice. It is thought that would reduce the pressure to perhaps provide an inappropriate form of GP consultation service involving the temptation to rapid throughputs of patients, clients or persons calling on the GP. It could also be that another range of practice grants could be available to provide incentives for desirable activities such as health promotion and prevention, immunisation, provision of allied health services, such as physiotherapy and nursing, or to target areas of special need, for example, rural areas, services for Aboriginals, palliative care, geriatric care and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

That grant will be then be greater than if a general practitioner bulkbilled individual patients. This would be done in the hope that the general practitioner, because of his bulkbilling, would not be financially disadvantaged and therefore could put through fewer patients than he would otherwise feel pressured to do for financial reasons. As I understand what the Minister said in relation to  that particular area, a block grant given to that GP to bulkbill or to have a service which is not a fee for service for patients would not financially benefit the GP over and above what it would if he were conducting a bulkbilling for a lesser number of patients.

I do not know that I ever mentioned bulkbilling as being what was sought to be displaced: it could be some other form of billing. However, fee for service was not to be the sole revenue generating mechanism in the GP's practice concerned, and the block grant or some formula like that would cover a payment simply not directly linked to the number of services provided.</PARA></TALK.START>

One is talking about all of the costs associated with the provision of the medical service from a particular premise, including lighting, heating, the physical requirements of waiting rooms and consulting rooms, et cetera.

If a grant&mdash;or a wage, under any other name;  we can call it whatever we like&mdash;is made, in the end the Government, not the patient, will be paying the doctor. When we get down to the nitty-gritty of this proposal, we find that the Government's philosophy has always been to socialise as many doctors as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can only emphasise that I do not see it as a wage. There is no contract of employment between the Government and the medical practitioner concerned. A payment will be made to the practice to defray all the costs of the practice. A portion would be a remuneration of the general practitioner concerned.

It may be that the doctor will get a range of possibilities which will back up, be of assistance to or supplement the intuitive, physical or face-to-face diagnosis that might be undertaken by the GP. That process seems to me to be very plain and straightforward. I understand that these computer programs are already being used in hospitals. Senator Walters shakes her head.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the Estimates Committee process, I questioned the definition of quality and I asked, `Does that goal include the quality of the care provided?'. The under-secretary said, inter alia, `Yes, it does encompass the idea of appropriate good quality health care'. I said, `The word "quality" is not used throughout the whole report'. The under-secretary said, `I believe it is encompassed in the word "appropriate"'. I had another go, and on this occasion my question was answered by Ms Batman. I said, `But you still do not have anything in place'. Ms Batman replied:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do have a monitoring strategy that we can put in place to monitor the impact of the 1 November changes. It is something that we are still working on.</PARA>
<PARA>I then asked of Ms Ariotti whether she would define quality. At this stage I began to think, `Perhaps I am wrong;  perhaps I do not understand the meaning of the word "quality"'. So I looked it up in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford English Dictionary</EMPHASIS>. `Quality' is defined as `degree of excellence, relative nature or kind or character'. I then looked up the thesaurus and found the words `calibre, distinction, excellence, grade, merit, standing, status, superiority, value or worth'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon, Senator Tate has talked about governments providing access, and I understand that. The bureaucracy is concerned about delivery. But patients and health care providers are concerned about quality, and that seems to have escaped both government and bureaucracy. There is a fundamental malaise in health care delivery in this nation, whether we like to believe it or not. It does not involve just health care financing: it also involves the quality of the service that is delivered. We have seen the recent changes by the Government in fooling around with decreasing rebates&mdash;$2.50 and $3.50. Just imagine the effect that reducing the rebates will have on quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw in an as yet unpublished paper by two authors of eminence something which encompassed the beliefs I have in relation to general practice in this country. We should bear in mind that general practice is the cornerstone of health care delivery in this nation. Unlike other nations&mdash; for example, the United States&mdash;we have a far greater number of general practitioners in proportion to specialists than does the United States; so there is no comparison. I quote from this document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life for Australian general practitioners is becoming a succession of professional and clinical contests. Still reeling from the destabilising debates over vocational registration, they now face turbulence over the question of restructuring. Professionally, many doctors feel impotent in a system that does not value their skills, progressively decreases rebates, excludes them from hospitals and leaves them exposed to the competitive pressures exerted by a growing surplus of community-based health professionals. The danger in the current situation is that general practitioners will become so immersed in adversarial conflict that the possibility of real and useful reform of the system will escape from their grasp.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clinically, many general practitioners feel that the current system is inhibiting the practice of good medicine. Rising community expectations for `quick cures' and the advent of entrepreneurial 24-hour, bulk-billing clinics have ensured that traditional general practice is struggling for its share of the primary medical market. Many general practices are marginally viable at present, and it now seems distinctly possible that the effects of the latest Budget changes will result in the professional demise of significant numbers of general practitioners at the same time as it increases costs to patients.</PARA>
<PARA>This leads me to the questions I want to ask, which cover some of the material Senator Walters asked about in relation to practice budgets. It is obvious that there is a design&mdash;and it is mentioned in Budget Paper No. 9&mdash;and an ongoing process. It is not good enough to say, `We are waiting for discussion with the professionals or the royal colleges'. It is not good enough, if this Government believes that it is planning for the future. One does not plan, produce something, deck it out, and then say, `We are waiting for discussions'. What if the professional bodies&mdash;the AMA and the College of General Practitioners&mdash;say to the Government, `Get lost; we are not going to discuss it with you'?  Does the Government have a fall-back position?  Will it impose it on them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This appears to be a government that knows what it is doing&mdash;although I doubt that. One only had to see what occurred in relation to the reduction of rebates. That was an absolute debacle, which is continuing and is fuelling the debate about who should be leader, because of the division within the Labor Party itself. My first question is: how much money does the Department envisage will be available, on a year by year basis, over the next five years for capital grants to general practitioners?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that there is no amount in the Appropriation Bills for Medicare rebates. There is a standing appropriation under section 125 of the Health Insurance Act for the Health Insurance Commission to spend what is needed for rebates.</PARA>
<PARA>The program performance statements for 1991-92 set out very clearly the reduction in the Medicare benefits at pages 196 and 197. Initially it was $3.50 and later $5. It sets out very clearly the changes to be made. Page 197 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimated outlays of $4,431.8m for 1991-92 represent an increase of $196.5m or 4.6% on outlays for 1990-91. An increased population base, a continuation of the historical increase in per capita utilisation and some fee drift (ie a shift towards more expensive services) offset by savings from benefit reductions, are estimated to account for $124m.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an estimate of the costs of Medicare benefits. Also, the Budget statement at page 3-63 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The most important of the measures is a single package containing the following two major components relating to the introduction of further co-payments under Medicare and changes to general practitioner (GP) funding arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister, but of course he could not expect that I would find it satisfactory. Firstly, for the Department itself and for all those officers who have served the cause of veterans for so long and so well, it is reflecting extremely badly on that Department and the tradition of those officers. For that I am extremely sad. A few people are tearing down the good relationship that has existed for many years between veterans and that Department; that is the first thing. Secondly, these employees of the Commonwealth who are in a very privileged position right now, with security of employment and security of tenure, when their countrymen are out of work, walking the streets looking for jobs, are being allowed to get away with not doing the job for which they are being fully paid. I do not accept that the Government is treating this matter with the urgency it deserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point is that these officers in their dispute with the Government are taking it out on the people who have fought for this country and the people who provide those veterans with the services to which they are entitled by way of compensation. How long can some of these domiciliary nurses and other health providers continue to provide a service for which they are not paid? Some of those domiciliary nurses are providing the only income to their households, are the sole parents or sole breadwinners in a family where the other spouse is out of work. Now, it seems to be that in Canberra, in protected Canberra, we can have this matter wander along in a very gentle way. I do not regard it as a gentle matter. For those reasons I regard it as extremely serious. I do not see the sense of urgency that I would have thought the Department and the Repatriation Commission would have felt on such an important matter. I am very disgusted. </PARA>

Referring to program 1, I would like to raise some questions about the defence service home loans. In response to questions which were taken on notice by the Department, it was explicitly stated that the 8 January amendment to subsection 4(1) of the Defence Service Homes Act was intended only to preserve the entitlement of one partner for later use. Given that the 8 January amendment has not had the effect intended, will the Department be seeking to further amend the legislation, and what section should have been amended to achieve the desired result?</PARA>

In the correspondence between the Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defence Science and Personnel that has been given to me by the Department, Mr Humphreys and his Department come out of this as being pretty caring of people caught up in this situation. I cannot say the same for Mr Bilney, whose correspondence is clearly much more concerned about the National Australia Bank's or Westpac's interests than about compensating or putting right people who have been caught up through no fault of their own by an incorrect interpretation of the law. I was extremely disappointed in the letter that Mr Bilney sent to Mr Humphreys which was signed on 9 August.

Also, the acting chief executive for the hospital, Mr Norm Davie, was reported as saying that MRSA was not considered dangerous and should not be confused with the more commonly known golden staph. The medical advice I have had, which was firstly about the nasal swab, is that this can kill, which is fairly dangerous to anybody, I would have thought, and particularly to elderly people such as we have in the repatriation hospital. That is why I am particularly concerned that proper procedures were not followed.

The executive said that the ward would reopen in about 10 days. I am also told that, once that particular bacterium is found in a hospital, it is extremely difficult to eradicate. It can be present in a hospital for years. So we are not just playing around. I am concerned to think that the repatriation hospital is being used as an overflow hospital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting point arises in relation to the various areas examined by our Committee, such as Industrial Relations, Primary Industries and Energy and Transport and Communications. We have found that the answers, particularly on Transport and Communications, have hit us on the deadline. Once again, that does not give us sufficient time to examine those answers and prepare the appropriate responses. This has not applied in the portfolio of Industrial Relations, but it certainly has applied with regard to Transport and Communications and Primary Industries and Energy.

I will not list them all; I just use those as examples.

I am sure the Public Service is pleased to hear acknowledgment of good performance and I think he gave that today with respect to my Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane's question concerns the National Health and Occupational Safety Commission, officially known as Worksafe Australia. The Commission is made up of representatives of the States and representatives of what we call the social partners, that is to say, the employers and the unions. It is a body chaired by Mr Lou Marks, a distinguished commercial figure with a commercial background in transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee of Worksafe Australia has set down a series of priority areas in which one can rationally direct attention to achieve the most valuable impact for money spent on research. I do not have the list in front of me, but I do know that it concerns investigation into back pain, the use of certain chemical materials and so on. There are a number of priority areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding of how funds are allocated is that Worksafe has a budget for allocation. Those priority areas are indicated to the world at large and groups interested in doing research or undertaking projects which assist in furthering knowledge about occupational health and safety then apply. They are assessed by this representative body and grants are given according to the type of project, the priority Worksafe has for it and the capacity of the organisation to deliver a result that is useful and meaningful. That is the basis of the allocation of those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane asked what happens in the case of an organisation with funds for a project or some research not expending the full value of the money that has been allocated. I am not advised of any example of that. I will seek confirmation in a minute from the officers in attendance as to whether they have any knowledge of under expenditure on a particular allocation. As Senator Crane knows, and I am sure recognises, all of this is subject to audit attention by the Auditor-General. Worksafe itself has a huge responsibility, a massive list of priorities and great demand for activity on its behalf. It never has anything like the funds that are necessary to meet all of the demands placed on it at any one time. Therefore, it is a sparing organisation in terms of funds allocated and accountability. I will now seek confirmation of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not advised that there is any area in which underexpenditure has occurred. There is no knowledge of such an event. If there were to be, then Worksafe could call back the money; or if the recipient of the grant were able to present additional work that might be done to further the objectives that the grant was given for in the first place, or objectives that fit with the priorities that Worksafe has declared, then Worksafe has an ability to authorise that additional or ongoing work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every so often the misallocation of public resources becomes so glaring and unjust that it is necessary to raise the issue in this chamber. Tonight I wish to draw the attention of the Senate, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to a very real problem that exists in the far north of Western Australia. Broome may have developed a growing national reputation as a tourist destination but the Kimberley region has more than its share of social dislocation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One agency that is fighting valiantly to provide crisis accommodation and family support is Catherine House. Anyone who visits there, as I did not so many months ago, cannot fail to be impressed with the dedication of its staff and with the enormity of the problems that they face. For 16 years Catherine House has been providing crisis accommodation to children whose families have broken down. While it does not cater exclusively for Aboriginal families, it is true to say that more than 90 per cent of its clients are Aboriginal, as are half of its board members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am talking about may not be an Aboriginal program per se. However, it is a clear commonsense issue involving Aboriginal welfare. This is not only a matter of accommodating children until their family situation has stabilised. Over the past year parents have been referred to alcohol rehabilitation and other specialised services, or have benefited from individual programs of the family support service. I should mention here the work that has been done by Christina Seenikatty, the coordinator at Catherine House, in the fight against the causes of family breakdown among Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be stressed that in the entire Kimberley region there is no other such support service, and Catherine House must also cater for Derby and Fitzroy Crossing. In the first six months of this year 70 children who were the victims of neglect, abuse and domestic violence were accommodated in Catherine House. Some of the children placed in Catherine House are seriously disturbed and violent, which increases pressure on the staff. Turnover of cottage parents is very high, not because of any lack of dedication&mdash;far from it&mdash;but purely and simply because of burn-out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay a special tribute to the work of Christina Seenikatty, who has kept the refuge operating while having to devote more and more of her time to the writing of submissions for funding. I was sad to hear today that Christina has now had to leave because of a lack of funding. She has done a wonderful job, as have so many of the house parents and cottage parents. Their work has been very much an integral part of what has been going on at Catherine House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This essential service is threatened by lack of funds. To provide an acceptable minimum service Catherine House needs $171,000 annually, only part of which is met by the Western Australia Department of Community Services. With the burden of WA Inc., there is not much chance of increased support by the State Government. I hope that the Federal Government will see reason on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed is a further $91,000 annually to enable Catherine House to survive and continue its essential community work, with some respite for a staff that presently functions at 2.3 full time units. Only this week the axe has fallen, with the coordinator's position and the family support services being discontinued. Catherine House will remain open for crisis accommodation but nothing can now be done to tackle the problems that make its continued operation necessary. Aboriginal families are the very big losers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has explained, that child welfare services are primarily a State responsibility and that the ATSIC budget for the Broome region for 1991-92 has been exhausted. I understand that the possible funding avenues through the Federal Department of Health, Housing and Community Services have also been exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There comes a time, however, when all these reasoned excuses have to take second place to meeting the most urgent needs of Aboriginal Australians. We have to remember that Commonwealth spending on Aboriginals exceeds $1 billion, with $640m allocated to ATSIC for 1991-92. When Catherine House cannot afford even to replace a vacuum cleaner or repair a television set, as I learned this week, I just wonder where some of these funds have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly ironic that on 25 October Australia Council Aboriginal arts grants totalling $2.2m were released. Of these, 28 grants totalling $524,000 were provided in Western Australia, and those awarded in Broome itself for writers, arts administration, music and oral history total just under $180,000. The grants in Broome alone are double the amount that Catherine House is asking, remembering that it needs only a further $91,000 annually to enable it to survive. But here we are talking about a sum of $180,000 in the Broome area alone in respect of arts. When other grants in the Kimberley are included, we are looking at close to $290,000 in Australia Council largess. As I have said, Catherine House services the whole of the Kimberley. When one pits $91,000 that is required for this essential service against $290,000 given out in arts grants it is all a little strange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need to be told that this money comes out of a separate department altogether but we have to remember that it all comes from the same source, namely from Australian taxpayers. The taxpayers of Western Australia whom I represent do not necessarily criticise arts grants to Aboriginal Australians or anyone else. Indeed, there are Aboriginal people with real and magnificent artistic talent in Broome, and I am not suggesting that the recipients of the $180,000 were undeserving in any way. I know that they are deserving, but I think the Aboriginal communities must also decide among themselves what is more deserving. Is it a question of trying to keep Catherine House going, or is it more important to promote their arts and culture?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, people have the right to ask why this Government, why our society, finds money for writers' grants when the most essential of services for the most disadvantaged members of the Kimberley community have to be so tragically curtailed. I really wonder why a society that gives Mr Michael Mansell $15,000 to write a book on social and political relationships plays pass the parcel on the matter of funding a refuge for Aboriginal children and providing support for their families. It is very illogical. This grant to Colonel Gaddafi's mate and admirer makes about as much sense as awarding public money to a Liberal Party activist to write a criticism of the policies of the Hawke Labor Government&mdash;although there would probably be more merit in that than there would be in giving $15,000 to Michael Mansell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only fair to note that the Australia Council has also announced 29 grants, totalling $1.2 million, for the performing arts in Western Australia. Again, I do not dispute the worthiness of many of the recipients, but I must ask once more:  where are our national priorities?  These grants include $8,000 for the Public Sector Union, a mere drop in the ocean when added to the $30 million&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. It is a bit like banning the veterans' payments, as Senator Newman says. That is a very important comparison, because we have these two areas of the community that are fighting for survival, that are fighting for money, yet we seem to have money allocated everywhere else. As I say, the grants include $8,000 for the Public Sector Union. Considering the $30m granted under various headings to unions by this Labor Government up to June last year, where is the justice?  In public life we all hear complaints that we live in an imperfect world with demands that we should solve problems overnight through `Where there's a will there's a way', as the old saying goes. Very often, as we all know, that is too simplistic. But is it simplistic and unreasonable for us to ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to start pulling levers, to start looking into hollow logs, to defer non-essential spending, and to talk to the Western Australian Government just to make sure that Aboriginal children and families in the Kimberley community do not lose this essential support?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until we can get our priorities right and fund those dedicated institutions and their staff&mdash;which must cope with the consequences of family breakdown, alcoholism and a whole range of other problems&mdash;we have no right to call ourselves a compassionate society; we would have to say that we are a very wasteful and stupid one. I hope that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, as a Western Australian, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table at the moment and who is a Western Australian but now not living in Western Australia, will take some interest in Catherine House and make sure that it does continue and that these Aboriginal children and their families are not just dumped in a ditch and left to die. Very many good people have put in an enormous amount of time to provide an excellent facility in a very remote region of Australia. I certainly hope that the money can be found&mdash;a mere $91,000&mdash;to keep Catherine House going. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what my fellow Western Australian senator has said about the funding for Catherine House. I think it is important that it does get the support that it needs to continue operating. The subject that I want to address tonight concerns something that has been bothering me over the past few days, and that is the question of the role of the so-called joint US-Australian facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar. There has been a lot of confusion over the role of these bases in the past few days following the publication of Professor Des Ball's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter</EMPHASIS>. I think it is important to put on record some of the contradictory and probably deliberately confusing information concerning these facilities, particularly that emanating from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and from the Department of Defence&mdash;or is it a case of the relevant Ministers not knowing what is going on?  In either case, it is pretty appalling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) about the role of the facilities following the recent changes announced by the United States and the Soviet Union with regard to the deployment of nuclear forces, I was told once again that it is not the Government's policy to comment on the role of the joint facilities or to speculate publicly about their future roles. We now learn from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, through his speech to the National Press Club on 4 November, that the United States had informed Australia that sharing early warning data with the Soviets was under consideration when the US President, Mr Bush, announced his nuclear arms cuts at the end of September. He quite clearly said that on 4 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the Government knew perfectly well that changes were under way, yet all Senator Ray could say to me on 8 October was that I should refer to the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the House of Representatives in 1988, a statement which is totally irrelevant in the enormously rapidly changing international climate. It is tragic that, even though the Cold War and the era of East-West confrontation is over, the Australian Government chooses to perpetuate the obsessive secrecy characteristic of the past era and refuses to allow any community discussion about the future of these bases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, we learned what the peace movement had alleged all along was the role of Nurrungar during the Gulf war, although at the time the Government again refused to confirm or deny the allegations. We have been saying for years and years that Nurrungar has a war fighting role as well as a verification and arms monitoring role. In fact, the arms control agreements that Pine Gap and Nurrungar are meant to monitor were not even in place when the bases were established. This has been our claim over many years and we have now been proved to be absolutely right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 20 years, both coalition and Labor governments have refused to acknowledge the roles of the bases. But, finally, it was spelt out yesterday in the Senate by the Minister for Defence. That was highly overdue. Of course, it was still a denial not only that the role of the bases was important in the early warning of Scud missiles emanating from Iraq during the Gulf war but also that all the information was important for the so-called strategic bombing by the coalition forces of the Iraqis. It was very clearly a war fighting role. Anyone familiar with the strategic role of such facilities knows perfectly well what they are about. Many books and articles have referred to these roles, but the Australian Government has continued its pattern of obsessive secrecy by refusing to comment on the role of what are in effect US bases on Australian soil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had hopes that, with the changing global situation, this Government would take up the opportunities presented by re-examining Australia's commitment to a military alliance drawn up and signed at the height of the Cold War and to the role of these bases that were set up just over 20 years ago to serve US global strategic requirements. But, no, all we get from Senator Ray is a comment that ANZUS had proved its durability and relevance over a period of 40 years and that he was confident that it would prove to be just as durable into the foreseeable future. Alliances come and go, and when they are no longer relevant they sink into the dustbin of history, like the South East Asia Treaty Organisation and the Baghdad Pact, and it is about time that the ANZUS alliance sank into that dustbin of history as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obfuscation continues with the role of Nurrungar since the changes announced by the United States and the Soviet Union. According to an ALP report on 4 November, a senior Australian defence official had said on the previous night that the Australian Government was well aware that Soviet military personnel `might' inspect the Nurrungar facility, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> of the same day quotes the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) as saying that the Australian Government was unaware of a US invitation to the Soviet Union to inspect a secret missile tracking base in South Australia, adding that he expected that the process of `demystifying' Nurrungar would continue soon. It can hardly be a continuation when the previous pattern has been obsessive secrecy. But, of course, Mr Bilney knew something then, which of course Senator Ray did reveal to the Senate yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 4 November quoted Senator Evans as saying that he was unaware of any US proposals to allow the Soviet Union to share nuclear early warning data from joint US-Australian bases. It reported:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`I am not being evasive,' he said. `I just have not read or heard anything which is sharply focused on any implications for the operations of the facilities.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that particular context at that time there was a communication from the US Government to our Government saying that the US was thinking about discussing sharing that warning information with the Soviet Union, but that the US would, of course, consult with Australia before pursuing that further.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on 5 November Senator Ray told Senator Spindler that there had been no approach from the United States to explore the possibility of expanding the current so-called joint facilities, or expanding new ones. The Minister then told Senator Faulkner that Professor Des Ball was jumping to conclusions in suggesting Soviet access to Nurrungar data and especially in relation to Soviet visits to Nurrungar. He went on to say that US officials have assured us that no discussions have been held with the USSR about sharing data from Nurrungar or about Soviet visits to Nurrungar, adding that none are currently contemplated. Now, when I attempted to ask more about what was going on in Question Time today, in light of these conflicting reports, I was once again fobbed off with a non-answer. The Minister confused is not a pretty sight. The Minister waffling is bad enough. The Minister not knowing what is going on is a disgrace. Two Ministers not knowing what is going on or deliberately misleading the Parliament is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of government to government communication did Senator Evans allude to, both at the Press Club the other day and here in the Parliament today? It is very clear, he says, that there was a government to government communication. Was it a cable, a telex, a phone call, a letter or some other form that we know not of? Was it another Bush-Hawke phone call towards the end of September?  President Bush is renowned for getting on the telephone and buzzing international leaders to inform them of his latest international strategic plans. Did he buzz Bob Hawke towards the end of September and say `Well, Bob, I am about to announce significant cuts in nuclear tactical weapons and this is going to have an effect on New Zealand, of course, and I neither confirm nor deny that a treaty is up for deliberation. It is going to embarrass the New Zealand Government into trying to change its policy on denying nuclear ships visits. It might have an effect on Australia also regarding the bases.'? Was there some phone call like that that we had not yet heard about? We just do not know what sort of government to government communication there was. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade says there was one: the Minister for Defence says there has been no approach and it is not likely in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence is totally unaware, if we are to believe his statements to Senator Spindler and Senator Faulkner yesterday, of these developments. It is interesting too that he was so dismissive of Professor Des Ball's claims, a tactic the previous Minister for Defence also used against Professor Ball's findings about Nurrungar's SDI links, which of course they have not bothered to refute in detail or in substance. That would give too much away. But Professor Ball is generally recognised as the expert in Australia on the operation of the US bases in this country. His research is painstaking and he is not likely to make empty or extravagant claims. As I said, the Government has never before proved him wrong. Whether there are Soviet personnel due to visit Nurrungar or not is beside the point. What is very significant is the proposal to share information gleaned through Pine Gap and Nurrungar with the Soviets or anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As a supporter of Glasnost and having consistently called for transparency in arms transfers, I support the sharing of information for peaceful purposes, but of course not for war-fighting roles, which is how Nurrungar information was used during the Gulf war, now by the Defence Minister's admission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But most of my questions to the Minister today remain unanswered. What about sharing information with other nations? I specifically asked that of the Minister in my question today, and because I had not given him notice he did not answer. These are meant to be questions without notice and one would think the Minister in charge of foreign affairs would know enough about his portfolio to be able to answer a question about this matter when it has been so much in the news lately. I asked him particularly: does the current proposal, if indeed there is one, extend to the British, the French, the Chinese or other countries concerned about the proliferation of ballistic missiles? There are 20 or so other countries either approaching or with ballistic missile capability. Are they also going to be privy to information gleaned through Pine Gap and Nurrungar?  It would not be a bad idea if, as I said, it was to be used for peaceful purposes. What about the power of veto resting with Australia? That part of the question, of course, was totally ignored. Of course, it is far too embarrassing because we know very well that Australia has never in the past insisted on the power of veto and, as I framed it in my question today, if the joint facilities were used, if information from them was used in a regional war situation that the Australian Government did not approve&mdash;a long shot I know but, as I said, we must live in hope that such things are possible&mdash;what about that? What about the situation if the Soviet Union was privy to information from Nurrungar? Would the Soviets be able to use that for use of ballistic missiles against one of the republics within the Soviet Union in their internal conflict situation, which could escalate?  Would Australia use the power of veto in that situation?  The Minister absolutely ignored that part of the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If, as the Minister for Defence would have us believe, we have an independent foreign policy&mdash;as he was so proudly proclaiming at the launch of his new book just two days ago&mdash;Australia should have the power of veto. After all, these are bases on our soil. Do we automatically get involved in any conflict which the United States gets involved with?  I know that we have not actually had anything to say of a negative kind about their adventures in Korea, Vietnam, Granada or the Gulf, and that is an unfortunate part of our history. It could occur in the future that we do not actually agree with the Americans. Are they going to pass on the information to other nations with whom they are in alliance but with whom we are not, as happened in the Gulf war? Australia's so-called policy of neutrality was breached during the Gulf war by the United States passing on information to its allies with whom we have no defence agreements. Now that is not a situation of a country which has an independent foreign policy. The Minister for Defence, of course, also likes to claim that we have an independent defence capability within an alliance framework. There is nothing independent about either, when, as this fiasco reveals, neither Minister is clear about what is going on regarding US bases on Australian soil. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only good report in today's news is that President Bush will not be visiting Australia next month. Thank goodness. The taxpayers might be saved a bit of taxpayers' money. It was going to cost at least $1m for members of the House of Representatives to be brought back to Canberra so that they could kowtow and ooh and ah for President Bush, as well as provide President Bush with the opportunity to address a joint sitting of parliament. This is not the Australian way of doing things when visiting heads of state come here. But this is what the Prime Minis-</PARA>
<PARA>ter was preparing to turn on for the President of the United States. Of course, we have already spent heaps of money on advance security preparations, and that cannot be recouped. However, thankfully, we will be spared the humiliating spectacle of our Prime Minister grovelling to the United States President on Australian soil, and that is a small mercy for which we must be grateful. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The income tax rates schedule for pensioners is the same as for taxpayers generally, and provides a tax free threshold of $5,400. In addition, persons who qualify for a full or part Australian Social Security pension have access to the pensioner rebate, which can extinguish tax liabilities where income is in excess of the $5,400 tax free threshold. In 1991-92, the pensioner rebate will enable single pensioners to earn non-pension income of up to $42 per week and married pensioners up to $74 per week combined, and pay no income tax.
