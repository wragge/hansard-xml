<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I do not want to take an unnecessary length of time before we move onto this debate, but the Opposition is disturbed that one of the facilities open to the Opposition in meeting its responsibility is that of Question Time. We are surprised and disappointed to see that the Government has set down an order of business for today which does not include a Question Time. It is particularly relevant as both the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) are in the Senate. We would wish to ask them a whole range of questions, as we believe it is our responsibility to do on behalf of the people of this country. Today we are not being given that opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand the Government has indicated that it will have a Question Time tomorrow, but that will be for simply one hour and will not provide the availability, clearly, that two Question Times would. Some of the matters that we will no doubt want to raise tomorrow will arise out of the debate that is going to take place. But there are many other questions on the public agenda now that we do not need a debate or a statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to raise. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) whether he is prepared to indicate the reason the Government chose not to allow the Senate a Question Time today and, in fact, whether he will consider Ministers answering questions by providing us with a Question Time at a later hour this day, either for an hour before the dinner break or an hour after the dinner break. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-There have been no formal discussions that I am aware of, other than relayed messages to the various people that normally set up the procedures in this chamber. We were most anxious, if this chamber was not to be reduced to a second level chamber, to have a simultaneous debate with the House of Representatives. That is the sole motive for Senator Button seeking leave to move a motion at the same time. I understand that the television cameras will go from one chamber to the other. I did not want to see, firstly, this chamber relegated to a second rate chamber and, secondly, the accusation being able to be made against any of us that we were playing petty politics in Question Time prior to dealing with the motion. We listed the normal procedures for tomorrow, including petitions, notices of motion, condolences and questions because the debate will be somewhat advanced by then. There was no desire by the Government to hide from Question Time, but there was a desire to get on with this most important matter-as most people in the chamber would acknowledge-at the same time as the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) reaffirms its support for an on-going role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations and in particular the resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) affirms its support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 678 for support in implementing that Resolution;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) expresses its full confidence in, and support for, Australian forces serving with the United Nations-sanctioned multi-national forces in the Gulf;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) deplores Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack upon Israel; and</PARA>
<PARA>(e) recognises, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel, once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, on 2 August 1990 Iraq's armed forces assaulted, seized and subjugated Kuwait. Now, with the authority of the United Nations (UN), and only after Iraq has made it clear that it would defy the United Nations by remaining in Kuwait, Australia has joined a great coalition of nations in a military commitment to defeat that invasion and to restore Kuwait's sovereignty and independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to commit Australian armed forces to combat is of course one that constitutionally is the prerogative of the Executive. It is fitting, however, that the Government places on parliamentary record the train of events behind this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> On 4 December I informed the Senate that following a decision of Cabinet, Australia was prepared to provide forces to participate in operations under the United Nations Security Council resolution 678 should that become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 January, after consulting senior Ministers, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave effect to that decision by authorising our naval task force in the Gulf to par-ticipate in such operations. The Prime Minister then formally notified the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Governor-General of the Government's action. The Prime Minister subsequently requested you, Mr President, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to recall Parliament so that the Prime Minister could report to the Parliament and to the nation on this grave issue, and so that honourable senators could have the opportunity to express their views. </PARA>
<PARA> The passage of this resolution will solemnly and forcefully underline to Iraq, to the United Nations, to our partners in the multinational force, and to our fellow Australians serving in the Gulf, the strength of Australia's support for our armed forces there and for the role to which they have been committed under the authority of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the most serious step any government can take, just as indeed war is the most serious action on which any nation can embark. In this turbulent century Australians, like many others, have endured severe trials of war and have made tremendous sacrifices to enjoy the fruits of peace. The last few days of fighting in the Middle East have served to remind us once more what a terrible price is paid when nations embark on war, and we must be prepared for worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The protests within Australia over recent days have reminded us too how deeply felt are the emotions aroused by any military commitment such as this. Let me assure every member of this Senate and every Australian that this Government is deeply concerned to see that this conflict is ended as soon as possible. Every decision and action we have taken since 2 August was aimed at preventing this war in the only way it could have been prevented, by upholding the United Nations resolution for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. Every member of this Government, not least the Prime Minister, shares with the overwhelming majority of the Australian people the sense of sadness, the compassion and sorrow for all the victims of this war, not least for the Iraqi people who have been hurled into this tragedy by a dictator. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been few wars-perhaps none in history-which have been debated so intensely and widely before the actual outbreak. In Australia there has been, as there should have been, the most intensive and comprehensive public debate. This is the third occasion on which the Government has initiated formal debate in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion it is of vital importance for us as senators to ensure that our constituents-the people of Australia-understand clearly why this war has come about, why this allied military response has become necessary, why the decision to commit Australian forces was a proper and a just one and what the goals are for which we are now fighting. Australians should be ready to commit our forces to combat only in the highest cause and only as a last resort. The Government believes most fervently that the cause which our forces now serve does embody nothing less than our highest aspirations and interests, and that we have committed our forces to combat only as a last resort. Those will be my themes today. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to commit Australian forces to this war in the Gulf is without historical precedent. Never has Australia's military action been undertaken with such global consent and within such a broad alliance. We stand with the coalition of nations the like of which, in its diversity, strength and authority, has never before been assembled. Never have the nations of the world acted in such overwhelming concert to condemn and to reverse an action as they have in these last few months condemned and acted to reverse Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> One hundred and forty-four nations in the United Nations General Assembly have condemned Iraq's invasion. About 40 nations have agreed to provide or help sustain military forces deployed in the Gulf to uphold the United Nations position. North Atlantic Treaty Organisation nations, former Soviet bloc nations, Arab nations, Muslim nations, Pacific nations-nations from every continent-have provided troops, ships, aircraft, medical teams, supplies and money. Members of this coalition are now conducting military action with the highest authority that the international community can bestow-the authority of the United Nations Security Council, given in resolution 678. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason this unprecedented coalition has come into existence is to achieve and preserve three interests of truly global importance. Each of these three interests is of tangible importance to each of the members of the coalition of nations, including Australia. None of the three can be achieved without first achieving, as the essential precondition, the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. These are indeed stakes worth fighting for, by peaceful means if possible but by force of arms if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> First, we seek to establish the conditions for peace and stability in the critical region of the Middle East. There can be no security in the Middle East while Iraq remains in occupation of Kuwait or continues to threaten the whole region. As this resolution acknowledges, it can only be after the current crisis is resolved that we can, as we must, intensify our efforts to establish peace and stability in the region, including through convening an international conference as part of this objective. As honourable senators know, we supported the concept of an international conference before this conflict erupted. We continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we seek to prevent the catastrophic distortion and disruption of the international economy that would result from Saddam Hussein being placed to pursue his goal of domination of the world oil market. This can be done only by restoring Kuwait's sovereignty. Let me nail that easy but mindless catchcry `no blood for oil'-as though we could somehow wish away the strategic, utterly vital nature of oil to our daily lives for the prosperity of our nation and the economic health of the world. The one who is shedding blood for oil is Saddam, who has shed the blood of so many Kuwait people on the altar of his ambitions, as he did for eight years the blood of his own and the Iranian people for the same purpose. It is he who seeks to dominate the oil market, and it would be he who would exact for it not only an economic but also a political and strategic price. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, beyond even these vital interests, we seek to achieve the promise of a freer, more peaceful and more prosperous world order in which the goals of the charter of the United Nations can at last be fulfilled-the promise that, until Iraq invaded Kuwait, was so tantalisingly within our reach now that we have put behind us the draining rivalry of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of civilisation is in large part about the attempt of humankind to move from the law of the jungle, where blood and might prevail, to the rule of free men by just law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a tragic truth, however, that our century has known more of the jungle than of justice: two world wars and tens of millions dead; countless smaller wars; and the development of weapons of mass destruction-chemical, biological and nuclear. The League of Nations collapsed, and for many years the United Nations was emasculated by great power contention, thereby denying the world, especially smaller nations like Australia, the prospect of a just system of collective security. </PARA>
<PARA> The last few years, however, have seen a dramatic turnaround. The Cold War has ended. The prospect of global nuclear holocaust has significantly diminished. Despite the current problems within the Soviet Union, we must hope, and work towards ensuring, that there will be no return to the superpower confrontation of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> We have entered a new global environment where the possibility of effective United Nations response to conflict or aggression has been growing ever stronger. The United Nations, in which the great powers now cooperate, has helped or is helping to bring peace in Namibia, Afghanistan, between Iran and Iraq itself, and potentially to Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein's special guilt lies in his defiance of the United Nations and his attempt to return to the era of unpunished aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> And our special responsibility is to try once more, but this time with real hope in our hearts, for an effective international system against aggression, a system in which all countries, great and small, play a part. If we fail in this obligation, in this the first test of the new international order after the Cold War, the consequences for our medium and long term security and for that of many other countries are deeply disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who say that this international system, centred on the United Nations Charter, is a system which rejects the use of force, I say that they have not read the Charter-or if they have, they choose now, conveniently, to ignore it. The centrepiece of the United Nations Charter, as established in the 1940s, was the collective use of force in extreme cases where no other way was left to punish and defeat aggression. This should be utterly unsurprising. The United Nations was, after all, founded by men and women who had just lived through a global slaughter the like of which had never been seen before. They knew why this slaughter had happened. It happened because men and women of decency, compassion and hope had turned their eyes away from the great evil which had arisen in their time. They hoped it could be reasoned with, placated; it could not. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that each generation has to learn anew the same hard truth-that peace without justice is a dangerous charade but that peace with justice is not given free of charge, but sometimes demands a high and terrible price. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister said to the people of Australia on Thursday, Mr President:</PARA>
<PARA>We all of us wish for peace. But we cannot have peace just by wishing for it or just by talking about it; we have to work for it, and sometimes, tragically, we have to fight for it. The great lesson of this century is that peace is bought at too high a price, if that price is the appeasement of aggression. </PARA>
<PARA>Do any of us believe that, if allowed to go unchecked, Saddam would have been content with Kuwait? Does anyone believe that he would not have sought to master Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, and manipulate his control over the world's oil supply, to the massive detriment not only of developed countries like Australia but also developing countries and the newly-emerging democracies of eastern Europe? Does anyone doubt that he would have used, once more, his chemical weapons-against his own people, or against his neighbours? Who doubts he would have continued to develop, and then perhaps use, biological and nuclear weapons?</PARA>
<PARA> These concerns are not merely our speculations-they reflect his actions in the past and in many cases his explicit threats for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a leader who, after his eight-year war with Iran, has attacked, without provocation, two countries in the last six months: Kuwait and, only in the last few days, Israel. This is a man who has brutalised his own people and the people of Kuwait, and who was prepared to take innocent hostages, including Australians, and use them as human shields. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a self-proclaimed leader of the Arab people, who has killed Arabs and crushed an Arab nation. He did not, as he later claimed, invade Kuwait for the sake of the Palestinians. Indeed, his exploitation of the Palestinian cause was for the most callous and transparent of reasons-to help him satisfy his own greed and territorial ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that the majority of the Australian people understand and accept the reason why this war has come about and why Australia has become involved. We believe the majority of Australians recognise the magnitude of Iraq's challenge to the world community and the importance of our campaign to meet and overcome the challenge. There are, of course, some voices raised in protest against the war and against our involvement. The Government does not in any way question the right of those voices to be heard-vocal protest is a proud part of Australia's democratic heritage-but it most profoundly disagrees with what those voices are saying today. </PARA>
<PARA> Here in the Senate, with logic and patience, let those criticisms be answered. It is vitally important, as we embark on a military endeavour that may not be short or simple, that every Australian understands the facts-not the slogans or dogmas, but facts-on which the Government's position is based. We have heard some say that this alliance serves only to promote the interests of the United States. But truly, Mr President, it serves the interests of the United Nations and of each of its members, including, of course, the United States, who rightly demand the freedom of collective security and individual sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard others say that this is purely an Arab problem requiring an Arab solution. But the solution chosen by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the Gulf states, including Kuwait itself, is clear: it is to seek the support of the United Nations and to participate in the multinational force against Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, we have heard others still who oppose this war and this Australian involvement because they opposed the Vietnam war and Australia's involvement in it. To them we say: do not debase the principled opposition that was voiced to the war in Vietnam and do not demean the motives of those who opposed it. Today we face a conflict of an utterly different kind. None of the great principles at stake in the Gulf-the principles I have outlined in the Senate today and previously-was at stake in Vietnam, and none of the principles on which we based our opposition to the Vietnamese war applies to the Gulf today. Most significantly, on this occasion as distinct from then, the processes which sought first to avoid conflict and which now mandate this action are the processes of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has appreciated the bipartisan support given to it at this time by Opposition members, and I take this opportunity to thank them for it. They will therefore understand the sense in which I make this point. My Party disagreed with Australian involvement in Vietnam. That is a clear matter of record which needs no elaboration here. But the Government will not be dissuaded from taking what is the right decision today by the invocation of that decision of 25 years ago-it is irrelevant and massively irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one issue on which all Australians of goodwill must stand united at this time. That is, we should all condemn without qualification any harassment, abuse or discrimination directed against Arabic and Muslim Australians. The suggestion that the entirely understandable concern of these people for their relatives, friends and former homelands constitutes some kind of disloyalty to Australia is a perverse and utterly distasteful one to me and to this Government-particularly so since, in the words of so many Arab Australians, they enjoy and value their new life in this country precisely because Australia is a land of peace, civil liberties and religious tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that there are many in the community who may well accept all that has been said so far, but who still feel disquiet on the grounds of timing-who judge that the allied military response is premature. Let me remind these people that this war did not begin on 17 January 1991. This war is not four days old. It began on 2 August last year, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. It is a war now in its sixth month. It is a war that has been fought against the innocent people of Kuwait in flagrant defiance of world opinion. It has been a war of ruthless suppression of Kuwaiti resistance fighters. It has been a war of systematic and premeditated plunder of Kuwait's assets by its greedy neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a war that has forced hundreds of thousands of Kuwaiti and foreign nationals out of their rightful homes. And it has been a war, as Amnesty International reported on 19 December, where the human rights of those who remain in Kuwait have been repeatedly and awfully violated, including through detention, torture, rape and summary executions. </PARA>
<PARA> In this war, an allied military response began only on 17 January. And none of the destruction that has been caused to Iraq's military capabilities in the allied bombing since then would have been necessary-none of it-had Saddam simply brought a halt to this war by complying with the United Nations and withdrawing his forces unconditionally from Kuwait. He can still bring a halt to this war by such compliance and withdrawal. We continue to hope that he will do so. </PARA>
<PARA> So, Mr President, let it be clearly understood that we-the allied nations-did not initiate this war; we did not want this war. We sought to resolve this conflict by diplomacy, not by force. But let it be equally clear why diplomacy could not prevent this war. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the 5 1/2 months since it invaded Kuwait, Iraq has ignored or rejected every international initiative aimed at resolving the crisis by peaceful means. The United Nations Security Council has, since the invasion, passed 12 resolutions on the issue. The message and the extent of its international support could not have been made clearer to Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, six weeks ago, the United Nations authorised the use of military force, if that should prove necessary, to compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The Security Council gave Iraq until 15 January-`as a pause of goodwill'-to withdraw of its own free will. Those six weeks passed. Iraq did not withdraw its forces from Kuwait. It showed no willingness even to consider withdrawing those forces. It refused the very generous proposals put forward by the UN Secretary-General as late as last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Over those weeks the nations supporting the UN made it clear that they were resolved, if there was no alternative, to liberate Kuwait by force in accordance with the UN's resolutions. Iraq's Government was under no illusions about that resolve. It knew it had only two choices: to withdraw peacefully or be expelled by force. </PARA>
<PARA> Over that same period Iraq's Government made it more and more clear that it had no intention of withdrawing from Kuwait. Saddam Hussein talked about negotiation, but he never talked about concession. Nothing that he said suggested that Iraq would ever relinquish Kuwait. Everything he did made it clear that he intended to hold Kuwait forever. Because that has been Saddam Hussein's decision, the rest of the world has faced a choice equally stark, and equally tragic; we must either accept Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, or we must fight to reverse it. There is, now, no other way. And the world has agreed that Iraq's seizure of Kuwait cannot be allowed to stand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The UN has demanded that Iraq should withdraw because the invasion of Kuwait, the destruction of its state, the slaughter of its people and the plundering of its wealth are contrary to every principle upon which the UN was built, and upon which peace depends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The UN has demanded that Iraq withdraw unconditionally because the nations of the world recognise that making concessions to aggressors is like making concessions to terrorists; it makes the world more dangerous for everyone. </PARA>
<PARA> The UN has agreed that, by giving concessions to the invader of Kuwait, we give away the principles upon which the United Nations was founded. Those principles are not airy abstractions; they are the laws that make the world safe for all of us. It cost the world the Second World War to establish those principles; they are too precious and too important to be bargained away to save Saddam Hussein's face. They are important enough to fight for. </PARA>
<PARA> At this moment of crisis, let us pay tribute to the courage and skill of our fellow Australians who serve aboard the HMAS Brisbane, the HMAS Sydney and the HMAS Success. They do us proud. They know the importance of the task we have asked them to perform; we know that whatever the danger they will perform that task as well as it can be done. We want them to know, and we want their families and loved ones to know, that we will bring them home as soon as possible when the job is done. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us ask the question in its most basic form. Why should Australia, here in the southern oceans, send its young men and women to fight thousands of kilometres from our shores? Why should we be concerned with, `a far away country of which we know little'-if I may borrow from Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain his description of Czechoslovakia as he consigned it to destruction in 1938? The answer, of course, lies in that very event-the fatal appeasement of Hitler. </PARA>
<PARA> The Czechoslovakians know something of life under a tyranny, having emerged from the Nazi scourge only to come under the rule of totalitarian communism. So it was truly significant to hear that the new democratically elected Government of Czechoslovakia expressed on 17 January its full support for the Gulf action. Earlier, President Vaclav Havel had said that no price is too high where aggression is concerned. Of course, there is special force, as well as poignancy, in that statement from President Havel. Czechoslovakia symbolises not only our terrible failures of the 1930s but also our great hopes for the 1990s and beyond. That is why his words are both a statement and a symbol of why this allied military campaign is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Czechoslovakians, invaded by a neighbour and abandoned by the rest of the world in 1938, know how important it is that Kuwait, invaded by its neighbour, not be abandoned by the rest of the world in 1991. They know it and, with the overthrow of the tyrannies of eastern Europe, they can express it and moreover can do something about it. Today, Czechoslovakian chemical decontamination teams are supporting the multinational effort to free Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The allied nations, with Australia, shall prevail against Iraq's aggression. We shall restore the sovereignty of Kuwait. In doing that we shall have done much more: we shall have established the conditions for peace and stability in the Middle East. We shall have protected the health of the international economy and we shall have erected and strengthened the framework for a world order in which all nations can live in greater peace and harmony. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, of course, no-one can expect that there will never again be a dictator like Saddam or an outrage such as his invasion of Kuwait. But by our actions now we will have made it harder for such outrages to be perpetrated and we will have made it easier for them to be punished and remedied by the world community, because each time aggression is resisted it becomes harder for the next aggressor; just as each time aggression is appeased, it becomes easier for the next. Australia, as much as any country, must surely value that achievement. We must surely value the way the world is asserting this truth. </PARA>
<PARA> The very coalition building that has united us since last August and the very resolve displayed by us through the United Nations are the very qualities that we want to preserve and protect when this Iraqi crisis is over. They are the very qualities that we want to see as the hallmarks of the new world order. It is fundamental to everything the Government has said today that when this crisis is over we will have opened the way to a safer and more peaceful world-a community of nations working more harmoniously through a reinvigorated and more effective United Nations organisation. Mr President, in such a world we are entitled to hold this basic and earnest wish: that we will be able to devote ourselves, as never before, to the real and urgent tasks of peace; not expending our resources on war, but investing them in social justice, economic development and human freedom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). I will take this opportunity to reiterate the reasons for the Opposition's support of the Australian commitment in this conflict. I also want to look at the new security order which might come out of the Gulf war and, in particular, what actions Australia might take in concert with others to influence an outcome which would enhance peace, stability and security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are, however, three preliminary points that I want to make. The first relates to the Parliament being given the opportunity to debate these issues, albeit after the commencement of the war. As you know, Mr President, parliaments in most democracies have been meeting and have endorsed the decisions of their respective governments to commit the use of force in bringing to an end the unlawful and brutal occupation of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's forces. It is clear that the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, had no intention of calling the Australian Parliament together and would not have done so but for the fact that he knew that the Senate was out of his control and was likely to be recalled. That conclusion is only logical from the statements that were made by the Acting Foreign Minister, the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Dr Blewett, and the spokesman for Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Parliament should not seek to usurp the constitutional functions of government, it is Parliament to which this Government is accountable, and the elected representatives of the Australian people should have the opportunity of questioning Ministers, receiving reports from government, and debating these momentous issues. I reiterate the regret I expressed a few moments ago that the Government has declined to give us the opportunity to question Ministers today on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before that there is no more grave a decision that a government might take than to commit Australia's Defence Force to armed conflict. We therefore want to make it clear that the Government should not assume that further issues will not develop over the next few days and weeks which in our minds will also require debate in this place, and may require debate before the Parliament is due to resume. The parliamentary system is a key to our democracy and our freedom. Our forces are being sent to help free another people who do not have our privileges and our safeguards. It is important that our safeguards are not taken for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The second preliminary matter I wish to raise concerns our armed forces. I take the opportunity, as the Minister did, to commend the contribution that our armed services make to our security. Those who give a life of service in this way, who know that in the event of hostilities it will be their lives that they commit for our protection, deserve much greater community recognition and support than they usually receive. This commendation includes their families, who make sacrifices simply by being service families but also know that their loved ones might be called upon at any time to make the supreme sacrifice. In commending Australia's forces in the Gulf, I include those who just as easily could be there. The Defence Force must know that we genuinely appreciate and recognise their key contribution to our society and our way of life. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I make arises out of the coverage of the war, which to me is being sensationalised. What is not coming through the coverage is the horror of war, the fear, the wasted lives, the maimed bodies and the families destroyed. In our liberal democracy we must reserve the use of force to preserve a freedom and a greater peace. It is legitimate to join collectively to do that, but the decision to use force of arms to achieve political objectives must always be recognised as a decision of enormous gravity. We can and should be proud of our forces. We can be pleased with the technical sophistication of our equipment, which hopefully will enable the achievement of objectives with the minimum loss of life, but we must never glorify military conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that President Bush, in carefully limiting the attack in terms of loss of life, in leaving open the option to Saddam Hussein to yield at any time and for his people to suffer no more, and for his care and caution, should be commended. He has acted with great dignity and we are fortunate that the world's great superpower is being led in this way. We are a little disappointed that that is not being recognised in the terms of the resolution that has been put to us. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important, as I said, to reiterate the position of the Opposition from the start of this crisis some five months ago. We supported an Australian contribution to resist the expansionist policies of Saddam Hussein and, in particular, his forceful taking of Kuwait. We in fact called upon the Australian Government to make a contribution in respect of what we perceived to be Australian interests at risk: first, the need to respect the sanctity and security of states from unjustified aggression; secondly, the peril of allowing an unanswerable dictator control over so much of the world's economy through, of course, the control of oil and the consequent suffering and conflict which could result therefrom-which does not seem to be appreciated by so many; thirdly, the need to preserve order and stability in a more complex world environment which was likely to follow the breaking down of the major power blocs-an end to the bipolar world, as it has been referred to. Mr President, in our opinion these are Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> We supported Australia joining in the United Nations (UN) resolutions and sending forces in support of the sanctions and their use, if it was ultimately necessary, to forcibly remove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. We believe that the Australian Government made the right decision. Certainly, we criticise the ambiguity of the original assessment, the confusion between Ministers over rules of engagement and the like, the lack of consultation with people such as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the divisions within the Government party, the Australian Labor Party, which demonstrated a lack of unity when it was necessary to show the strength of the Government's resolve. But we believe that the ultimate decisions were correct and we say so-no ifs or buts. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw sanctions as principally demonstrating the depth of resolve of the world community. They were to be part of a message. But we realised that if Saddam Hussein was not prepared to listen, sanctions would never force his withdrawal. Such is his style that he would make the people of Iraq suffer further before he would meet the international requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the decision to use force, in our opinion, had to be made and, as I said, in our view it was the correct decision. Those who doubt that, Mr President, should remember the following: first, it must be remembered there was no justification for Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Certainly, there was a quarrel over the price of oil. Saddam Hussein's nation, impoverished after eight years of war-which I must say he started-with Iran, wished that Kuwait would forgo its debts. And there was, of course, a dispute over the Rumaila oilfields. All these were capable of resolution by peaceful means. But Saddam Hussein acted in the only way he seemed to know to achieve an objective-through the use of brute force. </PARA>
<PARA> If historical claims were to be accepted as a legitimate basis for forceful invasion and occupation, then there would be no end to wars. So many of the national boundaries have been achieved through previous conflict or political bargains or seem to us to be arbitrary. But the current basis under which nation states seek to live in peace under the UN Charter is that they will respect those boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it should be remembered that Saddam Hussein's invasion and occupation was carried out with great brutality. Amnesty International has published horrifying accounts of the terror, the murder, the rape and, in fact, the systematic terror inflicted by the invading forces. If one adds to that the looting and pillage, as everything of value in Kuwait was seized, stripped and transported to Iraq, one is entitled to come to no other conclusion than that the conduct was totally abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, Kuwaiti leaders may live an extravagant lifestyle. There may not be in Kuwait the form of social justice which we might like to see. The powers of the Emir might be largely non-democratic. But none of these factors justified invasion and Saddam Hussein certainly could not claim that he was offering greater legitimacy in the field of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, thirdly we should never forget the inhuman use of innocent hostages to achieve political objectives. Already in some circles that behaviour is being forgotten. In using hostages as human shields for military installations, any semblance of internationally acceptable behaviour was forfeited. Fourthly, it must be remembered that the world community went to unprecedented lengths to convince him that he should voluntarily withdraw his forces. </PARA>
<PARA> These representations from friends and foe alike were universally dismissed by Saddam. After the visit of UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, it was apparent that Saddam Hussein was never going to voluntarily withdraw from Kuwait and that he would rather sacrifice his people than bow to the requirements of the international community to abandon his territorial acquisition. To the UN Secretary-General, an undisputed man of peace, he offered no hope-nothing at all to take back to the international community. Therefore, in the opinion of the coalition parties in this country, we believe that President Bush then had no other choice but to make the fateful decision that would lead the international alliance into war. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to deal with the technical aspects of the military conflict, assessment of hardware, tactics or other such matters but, as I said at the outset, I want to look at the form of regional or world order which might come out of the conflict and, in particular, the progress or otherwise towards a more stable and secure world order. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this war will in fact change the face of the region. With the defeat of Iraq, a major power vacuum could occur. But Iraqi policy over the past decade has hardly contributed to stability within the region. It has involved the Arab world in two major wars, the first of which lasted for eight years and cost one million lives. Iraq's quest for nuclear weapons had once provoked an Israeli attack and during the last two years had inflamed tension between Arabs and Israelis to levels unprecedented since 1973. The power vacuum, nevertheless, must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who have benefited and will benefit from the demise of Saddam Hussein's regime. Iran has already benefited significantly from the crisis over the last five months. Its enemy has been isolated from the rest of the world, the pre-1980 boundary between it and Iraq has been restored and it has experienced increased oil revenues. With Saddam Hussein's defeat, its most dangerous enemy will have been removed and the 1988 armed truce will have become much less fragile. Iran, however, will continue to resent any ongoing US presence. Its attitude towards Israel is also unlikely to change without at least a settlement of the Palestinian issue. How to bring Iran back into the family of cooperative nations is one of the greatest challenges the world community will have to face. </PARA>
<PARA> Egyptians will probably emerge with their leadership of the moderate Arab world intact and possibly strengthened. President Mubarak has clearly acted more skilfully than his admittedly courageous predecessor in rebuilding Arab support, but again there is evident in Egypt an underlying pan-Arabism which Saddam Hussein seems to be engendering. Again there is evidence of the fundamentalist forces which will seek to achieve political objectives through violent means, as they have done before in Egypt. Again, as in the case of so much of the Arab world, we find a country under enormous economic stress and, as we know, economic stress leads to instability and often political cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of Syria throughout the crisis has been one of great ambiguity and uncertainty. More than any other group the Syrian leadership has been deeply torn by the choices facing it. Its enmity towards its Iraqi sister regime has driven it into alliance with the United States and moderate Arab states, but its deep hatred of Israel remains. It is likely, after the war, that Syria will project itself as the most determined opponent of Israel. Its poor economic position and declining Soviet assistance to its armed forces will, however, almost certainly limit its ability to take independent action against the Israelis. Apart from the isolation of Baghdad, Syria has gained one significant advantage from the crisis: it has gained control over a vast proportion of Lebanon, including Beirut. It had a fair proportion before the conflict, but it has seized the advantage to take more. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this control is still fragile, it has to be recognised as a large step towards Syria achieving a goal which has eluded it for 14 years. The consequence of this control to certain minorities in Lebanon, particularly the Christians, is unclear, but to be other than concerned would be foolish. Syria has gained this advantage under the shield of its alliance contribution. It has therefore extracted advantage at potentially considerable cost. It might be argued, however, that its further commitment in the Lebanon will, at least in the short term, be a further factor in restricting its ability to take unilateral action against Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that of the Palestinians, Jordan's future is the most uncertain and problematic. King Hussein has previously traded on his reputation as a moderate Arab leader to secure support from the West and Saudi Arabia. This support will almost certainly dry up in the short term. He will have lost support of the Palestinians in his country. In order to accommodate his generally pro-Iraqi population, he has been driven to deal with political groups outside the traditional elite he has hitherto relied on. His recently elected parliament, with a clearly fundamentalist bent, has carried resolutions in support of Iraq. The stability of Jordan has been important to Israel and an unstable and impotent Jordan will present difficult policy decisions in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) typically nailed its colours to the mast of the Arab strongman it thought could challenge Israel, swiftly destroying the efforts of recent years to earn respectability with the West as a negotiating partner. It has not only now lost that credibility but also the sponsorship, particularly financial, of critical states such as Saudi Arabia as well as further alienating itself from Egypt with which it had been rebuilding bonds. This places the PLO in a desperate position and one fears that its answer might be to again resort more often to terrorism. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there was no suggestion that Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait to benefit the Palestinians, the crisis and his subsequent attempt at linkage has nevertheless served to bring the Palestinian question back to the attention of the world community. It is clear that there will be no ongoing peace or security within the Middle East until the Palestinian issue is resolved. I say that, of course, emphasising that any attempt at linkage must be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the Muslim world, far beyond just Arab communities, there is a certain solidarity with the Palestinian people and their perceived injustice. On the other hand, international conference or not, Israel will not reach an accommodation with the Palestinian people, and cannot be expected to do so, whilst it remains in a state of war with practically all Arab nations. It will not sacrifice its security for an insecure peace. Until the Arab and Islamic world is prepared to make peace with Israel, the Palestinian issue will remain unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA> An international conference, which is just another opportunity for the release of vitriol, might well be counterproductive. A better option might be a working group set up under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the UN-including the US, the European Community, Arab nations and Israel-to explore options. I have always thought-and notwithstanding the failures of the PLO in this exercise-that a settlement without the contribution of the PLO remains unlikely. I believe, therefore, that it should be given representation in any such group but that there should also be direct representation from the allied territories. </PARA>
<PARA> For Israel to accept such a working group would be an accommodation that it has not been prepared to make to date, because clearly it has not been prepared to deal with terrorists. But there are new concerns for Israel. The relative ease at which missiles are getting through; the fact that the first Islamic nation is not far off achieving nuclear weapons; the fact that settlement of this conflict will lead to massive rearmament within the region, the merit of which I doubt but which no doubt will occur; the growing power and sophistication in weaponry of countries such as Egypt, which may not always be under leadership such as that President Mubarak gives; and the growing loss of patience for Israel in Europe as to failure to achieve a resolution of these issues-all of those factors should be causing Israel to reconsider its long term security strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Iraq, there is no value in destroying Iraq as a nation. For years it has been seen to provide a balance and the rationale for that policy has not changed. What might happen to the Kurdish people in such a vacuum is too horrible to contemplate-the people who have, of course, already suffered the consequence of poison gas attack at the hands of Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf states will feel particularly vulnerable after this conflict and, in all likelihood, will seek a continuing United States (US) presence. Saudi Arabia might do likewise or compromise with some form of forward positions capacity. The US, having invested so much towards the goal of stability, will be tempted to accept these invitations. Yet, in the longer term, Islamic nations are not going to accept a continuing US presence which will grow as a focus for resentment and eventually lead to instability. The US must be particularly careful of simply being seen by the Arab masses as propping up feudal-type regimes which serve its interests. Reform will come from within such countries in due course and will provide new challenges, particularly to US policy-makers. </PARA>
<PARA> There must be greater effort made in the West to understand the Islamic and Arab peoples and their aspirations. Even within a country such as ours, more effort needs to be made to better understand our Muslim community, which numbers over 300,000. There is a deeply held view within the Arab world that they are exploited, that they have been milked of their natural wealth-that is, oil-and that their nations have been manipulated by Western powers and they suffer the indignity of holy places within occupied lands. It is true that millions of Arab people live in appalling conditions and there are in this tones of the north-south debate running through Arab issues. What I am saying is that it is important, in the long term, in the aspiration of seeking peace and stability within this region, to make more effort to understand the Arab point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> So there are major challenges which will arise out of a victory in war. It will not simply be a case of order replacing disorder. The Palestinian issue will have to be resolved; notwithstanding that, we reject linkage. Greater efforts will have to be made to overcome injustice and oppression within the Arab world. It is vitally important that the Arab world regain its dignity, which has been further shattered by Saddam Hussein's abuses. A formula will have to be found which enables Iraq to re-establish itself, hopefully under new leadership which will work to the goal of peace and improved prosperity for the long-suffering Iraqi people. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations, having been given new life, can help but it still has a long way to go. The UN can only be as useful as nation states allow it to be. Although it has played a useful function in this instance in providing a forum for debate, a forum for the coalescing of opinion and a sanction for actions that are to be taken, it is not the UN itself that has been able to resolve this issue; it is the US, in fact, that took the leadership. There is still no demonstration that the big powers wish to give the UN the authority of maintaining security, and probably it would still be premature. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an area in which Australia could play a visionary role. We have a good record in peacekeeping forces and other international functions. In this instance the US has shown leadership and made an enormous commitment. As the new multipolar world develops, it might not always be willing to do so, which lifts our responsibility and that of nations such as ours, which share our values, to meet it. </PARA>
<PARA> We pray that Iraq's aggression will be repelled, that the occupation will end soon, that the war will end quickly and with minimum loss of life on all sides. We look forward to then working to help meet the challenge of contributing to a more peaceful, stable and secure world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today debating a motion with regard to the conflict in the Middle East, a motion put before this Parliament concurrently in the House of Representatives and in the Senate.

<PARA> It defies belief that we are as a nation again at war. As we debate this motion, bombs with a total explosive power exceeding the Hiroshima nuclear weapon are being dropped daily on Iraq and Kuwait. Missiles are launched at non-military targets in Israel and Saudi Arabia, and there is a whole range of weapons with obscene potential for destruction being unleashed on vast numbers in the name of peace and the construction of a new world order.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. Despite the billing of this war as being an unprecedented television event, the immense suffering which is being inflicted daily is largely still out of view. We have seen the trauma of Israelis injured by Iraqi Scud missiles. We know the sufferings of the Kuwaitis under Iraq's brutal occupation, and we know Western airmen have died. Iraqis too have died in their thousands; most of these would be service personnel, but many would be civilians. None of these Iraqis have had any influence over the actions taken in their name by the dictatorial and brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. In their own way too they are innocent victims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst it is normal in war time to regard one's adversary's casualties as regrettable but unavoidable, we do not have the luxury in this case because the long term consequences of this carnage are likely to rebound badly against our own interests, and because death and destruction on the scale now being wrought-which in all probability already exceeds that wreaked by Iraq on Kuwait-was avoidable if alternative and peaceful means had been committed to by the United States, our country and other coalition nations. An alternative approach was in place and would have worked. That alternative was not appeasement, it was an alternative which sought instead to drive Iraq from Kuwait by means which were non-violent, civilised and proportionate to the initial crime, and would have prevented the emergence of deep divisions in the international community which are now inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The sanctions imposed on Iraq, the most effective and swift in world history, would almost certainly have had their desired effect if given time to work. The initial euphoric predictions of a quick victory have now been replaced by sober assessments that the war with Iraq will probably last months and will be bloody and costly, as many of us said in the months past as this inevitable consequence was being built up by the United States, by Australia and by other participating nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Anti-Western pro-Muslim feeling has erupted in many nations in Asia, deepening an existing international division based on religion, wealth and access to resources. Divisions are occurring within nations, including our own, as the government supports war while the people call for peace. The people's voice deserves to be heard in this place equally with that of the leadership which has now become arrogant and distanced from the people it is supposed to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> If the war goes on it is likely Iraq will ultimately be defeated, of course, but the hatred and resentment which spring from defeat will affect many generations of Iraqis and others to come, and will sooner or later come back to haunt us. None of this need have happened. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much talk of the war being sanctioned, and that is the term used in the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and by the United Nations Security Council in resolution 678. But resolution 678 called only for all necessary means to be used to remove Iraq from Kuwait. That is what the argument is about, to the extent that there is an argument in this Parliament, and thank goodness for the presence of those of us who are prepared to argue the case. While this leaves open the possible use of force of course, it also leaves it open to individual nations whether they believe that the use of force is warranted, and if so, whether to commit forces to war. </PARA>
<PARA> I would here like to stress that any of the reservations which I am expressing on behalf of my Party, and I believe on behalf of the majority of the Australian people, are not reservations with regard to our confidence in and our support of the service personnel who are deployed now in the Gulf. We certainly support that part of the motion of the Prime Minister, but we place the burden of responsibility where it belongs, squarely on the shoulders of the Federal Government and the Federal Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In our judgment there was no need to use force, as I have said, and no compulsion for Australia to take part in the United States led attack. It is possible at any time for our commitment in this obscene war to be reversed, and for the Australian Government to begin working for an immediate cease fire and a peaceful and just-and I stress the word just-resolution of the conflict. We have to ask ourselves whether placing the Emirs of Kuwait back in their positions of leadership in that nation would constitute justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to speak about the sanctions and the diplomatic action the subject of resolution 661, the first resolution of the United Nations that is relevant to the potential for a genuine new world order. That resolution represents the strongest action taken by the United Nations in this conflict, imposing mandatory and comprehensive sanctions on Iraq and Kuwait until Iraq withdraws. Resolution 661 won universal acceptance, including by this nation, and that was very much to our credit since we had a great deal to lose in trade terms. We hit ourselves in our own hip pocket where it hurts most. It was recognised from the outset that sanctions would need time to work, and we were repeatedly reminded of this by our own Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and his United States counterpart, the Secretary of State, James Baker. Sanctions experts reminded us that at least a year, perhaps two, would be needed. They also predicted that given the unprecedented effect of the sanctions, which have reduced Iraq's trade to a trickle, and given also Iraq's extraordinary dependence on trade, that the chances of success were very high. I would like to recall the words of Senator Evans on 31 August 1990, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no basis for assuming that the situation will be resolved by the end of the year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We must remain committed to staying the cause, doing everything we can as a nation, paying whatever price is necessary and securing a principal peace, however long it takes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the quote from Senator Evans. Whilst not ruling out the use of military force, Senator Evans noted that it was a means of last resort, and again I quote Senator Evans:</PARA>
<PARA>The concept of a quick, clean surgical strike to wipe out key installations while avoiding a wider conflagration, is a think-tank fantasy. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How right the honourable senator was. I go on with the quote from Senator Evans:</PARA>
<PARA>Any such exercise would be prolonged, messy and not especially productive. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I could not agree more. That was in August 1990, and I remind Senator Evans that the judgment remains valid now. Senator Evans, our Foreign Minister, repeated similar sentiments in October and early November, but in mid-November the Prime Minister stepped in. Reflecting a shift in the Bush Administration's position, he foreshadowed war, culminating in the December decision to commit our naval forces to the present conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is, as Professor Halliday warned in a Guardian Weekly article just two weeks after the invasion of Kuwait, that the Pentagon began agitating for a military strike from the outset. Within weeks its initial deployment for supposedly defensive purposes became an offensive force. The Pentagon never wanted sanctions to work. Our Government simply fell in behind this view. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote from an article in the Guardian Weekly which sums up what happened. That article was published on 23 December. I want to quote fully from this article because it is such a good assessment. The heading is an important one from the point of view of the position held by the Australian Democrats and, as I said, I believe by more than 50 per cent of the Australian community. The article, headed `Sanctions are not ``appeasement'' ', states:</PARA>
<PARA>One interesting figure needs to be kept constantly in mind during another week of increasingly frazzled Gulf diplomacy.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the week before Christmas, I remind the Senate. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>And the interesting thing about the interesting figure is how easily men who should remember it seem to forget. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure popped onto the public record only a couple of weeks ago, when the director of the CIA, William Webster, was giving evidence on Capitol Hill. He was talking about sanctions. Iraqi exports, he said, had been slashed by 97 per cent. That is an astonishing statistic (even more so than his Iraqi imports estimate, a mere 10 per cent of the trade before Saddam annexed Kuwait). It shows how total the embargo has become. It means the Baghdad regime is inexorably running out of the commodity on which its future depends: money. Oil revenues are the drip feed of Baghdad's life support system. Without them, the dictatorship will inevitably perish. </PARA>
<PARA> Why don't the allies trumpet this success? Why don't they repeatedly hail the economic noose that unprecedentedly effective, concerted world action has slipped around the transgressor's neck?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>These are uncomfortable questions. </PARA>
<PARA>And I note Senator Macdonald's discomfort. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The basic answer is that so much rhetoric and costly effort has been invested in the other melo- dramatic track of the policy-military build up, threatening war-that the slower burn of sanctions can't be stressed. Mr Bush cannot afford to wait. </PARA>
<PARA>No, Mr Bush could not afford to wait 15 years; he has a re-election coming up before 15 years are over. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>And when, as now, he pauses in anxiety, seeking an extra mile of diplomacy, his own previous dismissals of sanctions seem to leave that policy hanging irrelevantly as some wet, wimpish, purely delaying tactic. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be calmly observed that this is not so. Pouring men--</PARA>
<PARA>and, these days, some women as well-</PARA>
<PARA>and munitions into Saudi Arabia has not yet persuaded Saddam to leave Kuwait. Maintaining the current level of economic squeeze upon him would certainly do that, and more with time. Of course, tins of baby food and bottles of Jordanian beer seep into Iraq. Of course, the country can grow more food and hang on for months without appalling starvation. But Iraq cannot, in the end, survive if it can sell none of its oil: and the world, as the present situation makes manifest, can maintain that embargo for years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably, foolishly, the manic drumbeating about war has now rendered any return to a sanctions-centred policy politically impossible. But the embargo, rigorously maintained, is too important to be forgotten. If there is now, somehow, to be one last chance for diplomacy, oil sanctions are an integral part of the bargaining. Politicians talk freely in private about a nightmare scenario where a full or partial Iraq withdrawal from Kuwait leaves Saddam Hussein somehow triumphant, his war machine intact, his reputation bizarrely enhanced. They worry that he may steal a few oilwells in the subsequent haggling. But there is no cause for nightmares if the economic noose is kept drawn tight: there is no triumph of any sort for Saddam in a country brought to financial collapse by his own hand. Sanctions have-idiotically-become a codeword for ``appeasement'' in the current context. They are much more than that. They are already a formidable success: and they could have a greater role yet to play. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made in December. Since then, of course, we have seen the reality and the truth of that strategy put forward by the United States and supported by this country's leadership, to our shame. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to look at the questions of the impact and the effectiveness of this war. On the first day of this war the Pentagon trumpeted its success in having destroyed most of the Iraqi Air Force and its elite Republican Guard. Just today, we hear that only 11 or 12 of Iraq's 700 aircraft are confirmed destroyed, and the Republican Guard is again the target of the massive bombing raids led by the United States Air Force. President Bush has been quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I am somewhat concerned about the initial euphoria in some of the reports and reactions to the first day's developments. This effort will take us some time.</PARA>
<PARA>There is always a possibility that the conflict will be cut short by an Iraqi surrender, and we would certainly welcome that. However, that possibility is low and it is our contention that the risk should not have been taken in the first place, especially given the existence of an alternative non-violent strategy based on sanctions and diplomacy, as I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has truth yet again been the first casualty of war, but also we are now becoming aware that this war will cause tens of thousands-perhaps hundreds of thousands-of deaths, and even more injuries. There will be massive damage incurred by the civilian infrastructure of Iraq, Kuwait Israel, Saudi Arabia and possibly a number of other nations in the region: damage, destruction and death which, as I have said, could and should have been avoided. There will be enormous damage, and Senator Evans himself has noted the likelihood that Kuwait City will be destroyed once the ground war moves there. </PARA>
<PARA> There are political implications flowing from this war. We are already seeing demonstrations taking place, or being banned, in Muslim countries throughout Asia, such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Malaysia, as well as nations in the Middle East. The resentment arising from this resource war-and, make no mistake about it, that is what this war is-has enormous and ominous implications for the so-called new world order which President Bush and Prime Minister Hawke appear so enamoured of. We are not constructing a new world order by going to war; we are galloping backwards down the path to the past when that was the only option that national leaders could see-the option of attempting to solve international problems at the point of a gun. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, those problems have never been solved at the point of a gun. After the death and the destruction, the people involved in the conflict have had to sit down and talk, and that will be no less the case in this instance. The question must be asked: is all this damage proportionate to Iraq's crime? The answer is no. The death toll and the destruction of infrastructure will far exceed-probably already has exceeded-that already caused. The conflagration throughout the Middle East has only just begun. As I said earlier, we need to look towards a result arising from activity of a diplomatic and peaceful nature which will create the best balance of our concern for peace and justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has already been made of the response within our own community in respect of Arabic people and Muslims in this country. It is astonishing to know that as early as at least two months ago a very comprehensive report was put down about the problems-the discrimination and the violence-experienced in the early days amongst our Arabic and Muslim community. The staggering silence of the Government and the Opposition in that instance was quite notable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only in the last couple of weeks that we have heard anything from either the Government or the Opposition in support of the right-it is good to now hear it-of those people in our community to have concerns and to dissent, if they wish, from the decision of a government in a democratic country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are others of us, too, who claim the right to dissent, the right to voice that dissent. It is of deep regret that only 4 per cent of the parliamentarians in this place are prepared to oppose the action taken by our Government and by the United States. That 4 per cent clearly represents at least a majority of Australian citizens. Those Australian citizens-probably a considerable majority by this stage-have today been dubbed by the Prime Minister, who has been strongly supported in all of his statements by Dr Hewson in the other place, as mindless. That is an insult, first, to the democratic system and, secondly, to ordinary citizens of this country who have already mounted a wide range of demonstrations and protest actions of a size which took years to achieve at the time of the Vietnam moratorium. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Opposition need to think about what they are doing. After an historic decision in the post Cold War context of the United Nations-an historic decision imposing universal and strong sanctions which did work, which are working and which will work-this Government followed the path of a United States administration which clearly never intended to endorse, support and allow the implementation by non-violent means of the resolution of this conflict in the Middle East. Quite clearly, for whatever reasons, this Government decided that this United States Administration would be backed by this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not good enough for the people of Australia-a people who have been told by this Government that we have an independent foreign policy and that we have a self-reliant defence capacity. All of that has gone right out the window. That has been a fraud perpetrated on the Australian people. The Australian people now understand that and the Government and the Opposition, in its unanimity, will suffer from the backlash of that as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The rise in dissent against this Government represents far more than just a feeling about this particular action; it represents disillusionment with the Australian political system-with the old parties, which, to their shame, go as far as binding the consciences of their members who sit in this place. It is an utter disgrace. I have made a call to the Leaders of the old parties to free their members-people of conscience, wherever they sit in this Parliament-so that they can act according to their consciences when this motion, put before both Houses of the Parliament, finally comes to a vote at this special sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> We ask people-good people-to stand for election in this nation, in a free democracy. We need good people in this place; we need them to be able to bring what they say to the people out in the community into this place and to follow it right through to the point of the vote in the chamber, which is, after all, what this democratic system is all about. Nothing has more clearly shown the failure of the old political parties to bring genuine people's democracy into this place than this exercise-this futile, dangerous and unnecessary war. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion has a very interesting omission. It speaks not at all about further deployments. It certainly is a matter of enormous concern to the Australian Democrats, I am sure that it is a matter of concern to many members of the Australian Labor Party Government and it ought to be of concern to the wider Australian community, particularly in an environment in which the Government knows that there is enormous concern about the potential for escalation of this war, on a day when escalation is occurring, when there is another aircraft carrier on its way, when the British have committed further troops and when we face the possibility of President Bush making yet another telephone call and saying, `It's going to be a long one Prime Minister. I think we're going to need some more support from the Australian nation'. </PARA>
<PARA> We will need to take the opportunity-and I do so here-to ask the Government: Why that omission? Why is there no commitment against further deployments? Is this the open door that we need to leave for George Bush in case his fairyland scenario-to quote Senator Gareth Evans-really does not come off; in case the one-day war does not happen; in case it will not be a one-week war. If it is a one-year war there is certainly the potential for further requests of Australian personnel to go in there and fight and die in this futile war. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question relates to the fact that it is not only three ships that constitute the Australian involvement and support in this exercise. The United States bases on this soil, about which many of us have had concern for a very long time, about which many of us have protested on the streets and on site for many years, are playing a significant role-probably a more significant role than even the ships. There are questions to be asked of the Government on that score. What is their role? How much does Australia know about what is happening? How much control does Australia have over what is happening?</PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely essential that a comprehensive approach be taken to Middle East security. As I said, after the death and destruction, all the parties will need to sit down and talk. The problems in the Middle East are not just a question of border and resource conflict between Iraq and Kuwait. The conflict is historic and cultural in nature. The problems relate to the whole area. Nobody has mentioned the problem of the Kurdish people. That issue should be on the table in a comprehensive discussion of the issues in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also, of course, a whole range of concerns in that area. The Prime Minister's own motion refers to the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel. We agree that that is one of the major issue in the Middle East which needs to be addressed. But we ask the question on the whole range of issues: why not now? Why wait until death and destruction have been wreaked across the Middle East? It is quite clear, with the escalation of shelling of Israel and Saudi Arabia to begin with and the increased deployment of forces by the United States and the United Kingdom, that this conflict will be massively destructive even if we are able to bring it to an end relatively speedily. </PARA>
<PARA> But the question is: Why go through that? Why not sit and talk now? Why did we have to get into the entrenched provocative positions of those mindless old male leaders of this world, who can think of nothing but to take us back into the past and reject the peaceful options which are available in the post-Cold War era, when we could have had a new world order. </PARA>

<PARA> But sometimes wars have to be fought because the consequences of not fighting them are worse: postponing the destruction to another time and guaranteeing that it will occur on a greater and even more horrifying scale when it does. World War II was such a war. The only mistake of the civilised world was to wait too long to confront the Nazis with the only response they understood. The Korean War-the only previous example of the United Nations (UN) collective security process at work-was another such example. The war in the Gulf, which is now being fought under UN authority with the participation, the support or acquiescence-not just of the United States and its acolytes, as Senator Powell would have it-of all but three of its 160 members, is now the third such example. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a case of my country right or wrong, or even international majorities right or wrong: some of the wars in which Australia fought this century were avoidable, should never have involved Australians and should never have been fought at all. However, the Gulf is not World War I; the Gulf is not Vietnam. Hateful as it is, destructive as it is-and will continue to be-and more sickening as it may well become in terms of lives lost, the Gulf war is a war which has to be fought and has to be won. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend my time today justifying that statement and in particular answering two questions which seem to be at the heart of the objections of the Australian Democrats and indeed those of others in the community who are anxious about the course of events that have unfolded. Those questions are these: in the first place, are the things for which we are fighting in the Gulf ones over which the international community and Australia in particular should be prepared to fight at all? Are the issues at stake that important? The second question is: are they things for which we have to fight now? Was peace given a chance? Could sanctions have worked? Could diplomacy have worked? Should we have been more patient?</PARA>
<PARA> An incident having occurred in the gallery-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer all those questions but not in the way I think the gallery wants me to. Are the issues in the Gulf then ones for which we should be prepared to fight? The answer is unequivocally yes. The issues and the objectives involved have been very clearly defined by the UN Security Council resolutions. Two of those resolutions were explicit, for Iraq to get out of Kuwait and to restore the legitimate government of Kuwait, and one was implicit, to create the basis for achieving future peace and stability in the whole region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Getting Iraq out of Kuwait is something for which we should be prepared to fight and the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made amply clear why. It is important for the people of Kuwait, who have been murdered, tortured, raped, humiliated, brutalised and looted. It is important for other countries in the region, which are confronting a warmongering state which has the ambition to conquer and to assume leadership of the Arab world. It is a state which has the capacity to conquer within the region-a state which has one million men under arms, which has a chemical weapons capacity, which has possible biological weapons capacity and which is well on the way to achieving nuclear capacity. It is a country with a demonstrated instinct for brutality and aggression-by the use of chemical weapons against its own people, by its unprovoked aggression already against Kuwait and, as we have now seen, by its unprovoked aggression against Israel. It is important for the world economy and those dependent on it, not least the Third World countries already devastated by the high oil prices which have been maintained by the tension since this crisis began but also, of course, by an industrial world that could well have been held to ransom had Iraq been allowed to move on to Saudi Arabia and to capture in the process fully 45 per cent of the world's oil reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting Iraq out of Kuwait is important, above all else, for the future peace of the world, which depends crucially now, as has been said so often-most recently and most effectively today by the Prime Minister-on the effectiveness of collective security under UN institutions. The irony is that as the discipline of the Cold War fades, there is not only a set of new opportunities for peace but of new dangers of war. It is not just a matter of wanting peace; one has to create the conditions for peace. The founders of the United Nations always knew that peace enforcement was a necessary last resort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Getting Iraq out of Kuwait is important not only for all the objectives I have already mentioned; it is important in a very direct way for Australia's own future security. We do have a profound self-interest in comparatively strong countries in our region knowing that aggression in the future is simply not an option that the world will ever allow them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second objective which is being pursued under UN auspices is that of restoring the legitimate government of Kuwait. I think it has to be acknowledged that this has less immediate intuitive appeal for many people than the primary objective of getting Iraq out of Kuwait. Indeed, as a US official said to me at one stage, whatever else we are fighting for in the Gulf, it is not to make the world safe for feudalism. It is not, however, a principle with which one can toy; it is a fundamental principle-and must remain one-of international affairs that no sovereign nation, whatever its democratic or other deficiencies, can legitimately be invaded or annexed by another. The best we can hope for, acknowledging that the situation in Kuwait is in fact for the most part-and has been in the past-more democratic than elsewhere, is that the force of events and internal pressures will create an evolution towards a more democratic and responsive environment in that country. I for one am confident that will occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The third United Nations objective, and it is essentially an implicit one, is to create a basis for achieving peace and stability in the whole region in the aftermath of this crisis. It is not an objective of the UN or anybody else involved in this process at the moment to destroy Iraq, but certainly it is an objective to create conditions under which that country will not in the future be able to repeat its actions. Securing and putting into place an appropriate security regime for the region is obviously one of the world's highest priorities in the aftermath of this affair. It is also an objective shared by everyone, whatever the reluctance to accept the principle of linkage before the event, to move on from the Gulf crisis and, strengthened by the principles to emerge we hope from the successful resolution of the Gulf crisis, to address all the longstanding problems of the Middle East, including conspicuously among them that of the Palestinian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to spend a little more time following Senator Hill on what that post-war, post-crisis environment might look like, but that will have to wait for another occasion. All I want to say in summary of this part at the moment is that all the objectives that I have described-the objectives which we and, in effect, the whole world now are fighting for in the Gulf-are honourable objectives. They have been understood as such by the international community and that is why the international community has reacted with such unprecedented solidarity to support the process in which we are now engaged. Moreover, by and large they have been objectives which have been understood within the Australian community, as elsewhere, which is why there is, notwithstanding what we are hearing today, clear majority support in the community for the course that we have taken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But still there are questions obviously being asked, which must be answered. Was peace by non-military means really given a chance? Were sanctions given a sufficient chance? Was diplomacy given a sufficient chance? It is to those questions that I now want to turn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all hoped that sanctions would work and do so within a realistic timeframe, but the unhappy truth is that they have not worked and will not work within such a timeframe. The trouble is that for sanctions to work not just one but three things have to happen: in the first place, the net has to be tight, stopping the flow of goods in and out; there is no doubt about that. Secondly, the net has to produce real hurt, and not be compensated for by neutralising internal activity of one kind or another. Thirdly, and in many ways most crucially, a hurt when it occurs has to produce a change of policy by the government in question. </PARA>
<PARA> What has, in fact, happened in relation to those three elements? In the first place, it is the case that the net has been drawn tight-unprecedentedly so on the best available estimates, which happen to be those of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and which I noticed Senator Powell had pleasure in quoting-to the extent of some 90 to 95 per cent of all goods moving in and out of Iraq. That is what I and others meant when I said some three months ago that the evidence seemed to be that sanctions in that respect were working. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the second point-the hurt. Has the hurt been as great as we hoped and as we expected? The answer is that that has not been the case. Militarily there has been no hurt at all, but that I guess is to be expected in a country of this kind where all resources are given priority so far as the military is concerned. There has not been great pressure on food because of compensating internal supply increases, not to mention some looted and supplied from Kuwait. In any event, food is a legitimate humanitarian exemption under the UN regime. There is some inflation of a significant kind in non-staple, non-subsidised areas, but that has not proved crippling and will not, on everyone's estimates, for the infinitely foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as industry and infrastructure in Iraq are concerned, there has been significant hurt but not yet massive hurt where it matters. There has been a massive windback in oil and fuel production as Senator Powell-again relying as I did on the CIA-acknowledges, but the impact of that has been financial only, and that financial impact is not enough to produce the kinds of results that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some hurt of a very visible and obvious kind on non-essential manufacturing. That has largely stopped, but that has not in any way significantly impacted on the economy or the welfare of Iraq as a whole. Regarding essential manufacturing-heavy industry and so on-the percentage impact so far, despite early expectations to the contrary, has been small, with many of those factories managing largely by ad hoc arrangements, by cannibalisation, again not least assisted by the looting that has been done from Kuwait. So far as transport, water supply and energy considerations are concerned, again despite some expectations and hopes to the contrary, the impact has been marginal. There are no clues as to when the impact will be anything more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the third element in the equation-when does hurt, when it does occur, get translated into policy change?-we have to appreciate that there is a real weakness in dealing in this respect with a dictatorship as compared with a democracy; a dictatorship in particular whose raison d'etre is warmongering. Sanctions are always important for the psychological effect they have at least as much as for their real effect, but dictatorial societies, regrettably, operate on a different psychological basis from our own. Governments decide by reference to different criteria, and community fear makes the pressure from that source rather less obtrusive than might otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> How long do we have to wait for sanctions to satisfy not just one but all three of those preconditions? It is probably the case that sanctions would work in the long run, but how long can we afford that long run to be? How many more Kuwaitis are to be killed, maimed, raped, robbed, brutalised and looted before we say that enough is enough? How many developing countries are going to suffer economically for how much longer with oil prices driven up as they have been by the tension that was generated before these attacks took place? How much more time is Iraq to be given, not just to dig in to Kuwait, not just to consolidate its hold on Kuwait, but to fully develop and further develop its chemical weapons capacity and to find ways of fixing those chemical warheads, if it does not possess that technology already, onto its missile systems? How much longer are we to wait while it further develops its biological weapons capacity?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much further time is Iraq to be given to work through to develop its nuclear option, which may be as little as a year away from realisation? A reasonable additional question, although it is not a comfortable one, is: how long can we wait before the international coalition begins, for whatever reason, to crumble a little around the edges? There is always a risk of aggression becoming a fait accompli if wrongs are not righted quickly. It is an often remarked fact of international life in international affairs that longevity promotes legitimacy. Saddam is relying on time being on his side. Time was on his side in this respect; it certainly was not on the world's side. The UN made its decision on 28 November, resolution 678, that sanctions were not likely to work within a reasonable timeframe. Essentially we had the debate then about the likely efficacy of sanctions and nothing has changed subsequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What about diplomacy? Was that given a sufficient chance before 15 January? Honourable senators will not be surprised to hear that I believe it was. I say that not just as a matter of intuition, not just as a matter of assertion, but on the basis of the very systematic exploration of that issue in which I was able to engage by virtue of being overseas for the last 10 days engaged in intensive discussions in Washington, New York at the United Nations, Ottowa and in three European capitals-London, Paris and Madrid. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not retail the whole course of those discussions which paralleled exactly the last minute diplomatic efforts that were being made in a number of quarters to try to bring this matter to a resolution without the necessity to implement the use of force. I can make the point by referring to just two sets of discussions that I had. One was with the United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on the afternoon of 15 January, just half an hour before he delivered his final statement, his final appeal to Iraq-an appeal that held out a variety of olive branches. In his conversation with me, he made the following points: no-one could have done any more to achieve peace than had been done by him and all the others who had been promoting in one way or another this or that peace plan; there was no sign at any time that Saddam was prepared to withdraw under any condition put to him, least of all those that Perez de Cuellar was about to put once again to Hussein via the public media; Iraq simply did not seem to want peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to another set of discussions I had in France. They coincided with and followed the last-minute initiative that France engaged in in the Security Council on 14 and 15 January-an initiative that generated a huge amount of international interest but one that was rejected in the Security Council by the United States and by the United Kingdom because, among other things, it was seen as going just too far in offering unacceptable linkage between Iraq's withdrawal and addressing other outstanding Middle East questions. </PARA>
<PARA> My question to the French-it was put to the Prime Minister, to people in the Foreign Ministry and to a whole range of interlocutors over two days of conversations-was: would it have made any difference if the French resolution, more explicit in its offerings than any other in terms of the last-minute diplomatic olive branch, had been adopted by the Security Council? I can tell the Senate that the answer I got, in absolute honesty and with absolute frankness from all my interlocutors, was no. There was simply no sign that Saddam was likely to be responsive to such an initiative. There had been ample previous opportunity in a less public and a less conspicuous way for him to give such a sign. The auguries were hopeless. In the aftermath of that exercise in the Security Council there was no bitterness on the part of the French: they believed they had made one last gesture in that respect but in practice it would not have made any difference. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further consideration we need to bear in mind when we think about the diplomatic efforts that were made, not just those up to the eleventh hour, up to the stroke of midnight on 15 January, but in the short period that was left open after that. There is quite a widespread sense around the place-certainly in the conversations that I had-that maybe Saddam was never going to make a concession in accordance with the timetable imposed upon him by the United Nations. Maybe he was never going to make an eleventh hour concession, but maybe he would be prepared to make a thirteenth hour concession. He was given a thirteenth hour and a fourteenth and a fifteenth and almost another 24 hours to make such a concession by the fact that the United States, the coalition operating under the UN authority, did not launch an attack until nearly a full 24 hours had elapsed after the initial deadline. There was that opportunity given, had that been the reason why it was impossible for Saddam to accept the kind of offer that had been put to him to withdraw before the deadline that was set. </PARA>
<PARA> We all want peace, but we do not want peace on the terms of someone like Saddam Hussein. We want a credible basis for pursuing peace-not just waiting for something to turn up and not just appeasing and hoping each time that a little bit more will be enough. There comes a time when patient diplomacy simply runs its course. The world was too patient when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931. It was too patient when Italy attacked Abyssinia-now known as Ethiopia-in 1936. The world was too patient again when Hitler invaded the Rhineland in 1936, and it was too patient when he invaded Austria in March 1938 and too patient again, finally, when he invaded Czechoslovakia in September 1938. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that sanctions had run their course and diplomacy had run its course by 15 January. The choice the world faced, and the choice that Australia faced, was whether to follow the logic of our own intellectual and moral commitment to collective security or to turn our backs and let a monstrous precedent take its course. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by saying this-it comes back to what I said at the outset: it is a real irony, it seems to me, of the political process that, when it comes to war and peace, every generation tends to remember the lessons of only the most immediate political past. Governments which appeased Hitler in the 1930s did so because they remembered the failure of diplomacy to prevent a wholly avoidable and a wholly unnecessary war in 1914. I think it is fair to say that governments which took us into the wrong war in Vietnam did so because they remembered the failure of the appeasers and they were determined to stop what they perceived to be the onward march of communist aggression, failing, of course, to appreciate that they were confronting a quite different phenomenon-that of anti-colonial nationalism. Those who now, with their minds full of the Vietnam failure, think that governments are leading us into the wrong war in the Gulf have also misremembered and misapplied the past. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are dealing with in the Gulf is not a Vietnam situation and not a pre-World War I situation, but a 1930s situation of naked indefensible aggression by a strong, ruthless and ambitious sovereign country over a weaker neighbour-a situation that other governments in the 1930s and the collective security apparatus at the time utterly failed to address, with consequences that proved horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA> The new collective security that was put in place in 1945 to enable these situations to be addressed was, as it turned out, reduced to impotence for 45 years by a new set of international dynamics-the Cold War-that made it in practice impossible to mobilise across-the-board support for action against any indefensible aggression that did occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The position now, and it cannot be said too often, is that with the end of the Cold War that UN apparatus-that optimistic apparatus, that far-reaching, forward looking apparatus-put in place in 1945 arising out of the ashes of the diplomatic and military failures of the past is capable now of working again. The situation in the Gulf-it is on a smaller scale than Germany in the 1930s but the parallels are immense and obvious-is exactly the kind of situation that that collective security apparatus of the United Nations was designed to cope with. The world has a responsibility, remembering not just selectively but remembering all the lessons of the past, to make sure that this time it works. </PARA>
<PARA> All the preconditions for measured, responsible, effective and moral international action have been satisfied. Nobody wanted to plunge into war on or after 15 January. But if aggression was not to be turned back by sanctions, and it had lost the capacity to be so, and if aggression was not to be turned back by diplomacy-and I believe that diplomacy for all the reasons I have stated, had run its course-then that aggression had to be met by the only language it could understand if the world of the future, the world which is our responsibility to try to create, is ever to be peaceful and secure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is asked to affirm support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in its resolution 678 and for supporting the implementation of that resolution. That resolution authorises member states cooperating with the Government of Kuwait, unless Iraq on or before 15 January 1991 fully implements a whole series of United Nations resolutions, which are set out, to use all necessary means to uphold and implement Security Council resolutions and all subsequent relevant resolutions to restore international peace and security in the area and requests all states to provide appropriate support for the actions undertaken in pursuance of that resolution. The motion before us also expresses the full confidence of the Senate in and support for the Australian forces serving with the multinational forces in the Gulf which are there not only with the sanction but also at the request of the United Nations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate should have no difficulty, Mr Deputy President, in supporting the motion that is before us. I want now to turn to the events as they have unfolded since 2 August last year, nearly six months ago. On that fateful day-fateful for the world-the Iraqi forces, under the control of the dictator Saddam Hussein, invaded and, in a short space of time, commenced their brutal occupation of Kuwait. They did so without any justification, without any provocation. It is the most clear-cut case of naked aggression which has occurred in the world since the end of the Second World War. It is not just another dispute; it is not just another of the many instances of aggression and invasion which have occurred over that period; it was and continues to be a uniquely gross violation of the principles which have been established in the United Nations charters and adopted by the world community since 1945.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation which has developed in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, in defiance of all the attempts made at the diplomatic level-as Senator Evans has very clearly pointed out in his speech-has developed in defiance of the sanctions to which the Australian Democrats attach so much significance. Those sanctions have failed, apparently, to make any impact whatsoever on the decisions taken by Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi dictatorship on that day, which they have maintained ever since and continue to maintain, despite the inevitable consequences which occurred last Thursday, 17 January, in the form of the action taken by the multinational force, clearly in pursuance of that resolution of the United Nations which I have read. </PARA>
<PARA> People who believe that something more could be done, that further diplomacy would be possible, that sanctions may work, must be completely deluding themselves about the nature of the situation with which the world is faced. We have had this demonstrated by the nature of the invasion, by the conduct of Iraqi troops and the Iraqi Government in Kuwait over that period, but what have we seen from Saddam Hussein himself since the multinational force commenced to give effect to the resolution of the United Nations?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the most obvious steps that Saddam Hussein took following the action against him was not to respond to that but in fact to attack Isreal. He has directed his missile force, such as it is, not so much until today at those forces which are arraigned against him, but at a separate nation, Israel, which was and clearly still is endeavouring to avoid involvement in this conflict. This is the action of a man whom the Australian Democrats, whom Senator Powell and no doubt Senator Vallentine, say we should still be dealing with. Not only has he taken that further nakedly aggressive step against Israel, as he had done against Kuwait in August, but also this person the world is faced with is a man who has been constantly calling for a holy war by the whole Islamic world against Israel and those forces standing firm against his aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> Here is a man who not only has defied the whole world community and the United Nations but also is seeking greatly to enlarge the war which he has brought upon himself as a result of his actions on 2 August. There is a unique problem here facing the world community. Hateful as a decision to go to war is, there is clearly a time when it is justified. If ever there was such a time, this is surely it. It is essentially for that reason that the Opposition will be supporting this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill has pointed out, the motion has been drafted by the Government and presented to the Senate with very little opportunity for consultation with the Opposition. The Opposition has some difficulty with certain aspects of it. Some of those have been pointed out by Senator Hill. We believe that the motion should have emphasised more clearly the nature of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> An expression of confident support for our forces who are operating with the multinational force in the Gulf has been amended by the Government to recognise that it is not a United Nations force but a force which has been sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council. In other words, it is not actually being commanded and directed by the United Nations; it is a multinational force. Twenty-eight nations have joined together to give effect to the decisions of the United Nations and the call that has been made by the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition would certainly want to emphasise the leading role that the United States has played in putting together that coalition of multinational force over these months. It has been a notable piece of diplomacy and leadership by the United States. But, of course, we must give credit to all those nations who have responded-as the Australian Government has responded, with the support of the Opposition-ever since these events commenced in August. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the Opposition wants to make it quite clear that although we will support the fifth limb of the motion as being a factual statement-one which I think has been recognised as the course that events will take-we do not want to suggest for one minute that there should be any linkage between a peace conference in the Middle East and the decisions that are being taken to remove Iraq from Kuwait. The invasion of Kuwait stands alone in all its naked infamy. The efforts of the United Nations and of all the nations in the multinational force are directed without any conditions whatever to the restoration of the status quo, as far as possible, and the removal of Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> What may follow after that is a separate question altogether. We recognise that this will occur in due course, but it is not to be linked with the actual decisions and the course of action on which the multinational forces, and all the nations who are participating, have embarked. We have taken this view in light of all these events, in light of all the failures of the sanctions and the failures of the diplomacy, and in light of the enormity of the crimes that are being committed by Saddam and his henchmen in the leadership of Iraq. We do not quarrel with the Iraqi people but with the situation into which they have been led by Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a unique situation which has arisen in the world and there is a unique opportunity for the world to do something about it. As I said in this chamber in December when we last debated this subject, this is really the first opportunity that has arisen for the United Nations to take the step which it has taken. It has been able to do so because of the end of the Cold War. It has been able to do so because of the Soviet Union's neutrality and the support which it has given-although it is not giving physical support as part of the multinational force. This has been the first opportunity in 45 years for the United Nations to operate as was intended by its founders in 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a unique situation for a number of reasons. It is an extraordinary failure on the part of the Democrats that they are not prepared to join with the Opposition and support the Government in the circumstances that I have outlined. I have just been looking at a very interesting summary of what I have been trying to say-and perhaps it is better expressed. An article published yesterday in a Western Australian newspaper says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Iraqi killers have already been responsible for more than a million deaths, inflicting hideous pain through chemicals and by terrible acts of torture on their own people. </PARA>
<PARA> Now they imperil the economic and political stability of the entire world. </PARA>
<PARA> They jeopardise the hopes and happiness of hundreds of millions of people in newly emerging eastern European economies who have not known financial security for 50 years. If the 28-nation task force in the Gulf succeeds, it will certainly begin a new era in world politics where it can be proven that the United Nations can provide peace and safety for small nations. </PARA>
<PARA>The author of this article is one Don Chipp, the founder of the Democrats and the former distinguished leader of the Democrats in this chamber. Former Senator Chipp is expressing-as I am not surprised, knowing him-the very views which I have tried to express in this debate and which the Opposition has certainly been expressing very firmly and clearly for nearly six months. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that what former Senator Chipp has said is an utter repudiation of what the Democrat Leader, his rather undistinguished successor, has said today. Senator Powell, under the influence no doubt of Senator Coulter and other Democrats, has taken a stance today-it is the stance that the Democrats have taken throughout-which totally repudiates the views of her former leader and founder, Senator Chipp. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that the whole of the opposition to the stance taken by the Government, with the support of the Opposition, throughout this unhappy period since 2 August has been motivated not by an appreciation of the factors which we have been emphasising in this debate, which the Government has been emphasising and which Senator Evans emphasised so clearly in his speech, but by a reaction based at best purely on a pacifist view of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I have respect for the views of those people who are genuinely pacifists, although I totally disagree with them. But that is the best one can say for the case that has been put against the actions that have been taken. The protesters that we see today-the sorts of people who have been calling for peace for the last 30 or 40 years-claim to support the United Nations. They argue: `We have the United Nations; there ought not be this Cold War between superpowers; and the whole of the world's problems must be solved by the United Nations'. We have the situation in which the United Nations from the very beginning of this problem has acted in remarkable concert with the authorisation, imposition and enforcement of sanctions. Australia decided to support the United Nations final resolution, which I have read out, and we have committed our forces to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who have had a genuine interest in preserving peace in the world, through the medium of the United Nations we can have no better example of how that can be achieved. I would have thought that for those people, in particular, there would have been the clearest support for what has been done. If that view about preserving peace is that of the Democrats, I cannot understand why they are opposing these steps. </PARA>
<PARA> Today Senator Powell talked about giving sanctions a greater opportunity to work. I do not want to add anything to what Senator Evans has said in response to that, but let me remind the Senate that when we had a debate in this chamber on about 20 August, following the United Nations' decision not only to impose the sanctions but also to authorise actions to be taken so as to give effect to and thereby implement those sanctions, the Government, again with the support of the Opposition, of course, approved the sending of a naval task force to implement those sanctions and to give some meaning to the enforcement of those sanctions. That was the one very limb of the resolution which the Democrats opposed. The Democrats supported the principle of sanctions but were not prepared to support the enforcement of them in that way. So, at all stages in this debate, I regret to say, the Democrats have sought to make some excuse as to why Australia should do nothing and, presumably, why the world should do nothing to meet this naked aggression with which it has been faced. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I will say a few words about the role of the Australian defence forces in this current war which is now well under way. We have already debated that role on a previous occasion and I do not want to add anything further to it. But I would emphasise the fact that the 800 or so young Australians who are serving in the Gulf region in this war are bearing the real responsibility for the actions that we are taking in this place and the decisions which have been made previously and which are going to be made in this chamber today or tomorrow. They have already shown the prowess and dedication to duty which we would expect of them and which is in the finest traditions of the Australian Defence Force. It is not just those who are there now but those who were in the first ships which went there and those who have returned to Australia and who may well have to return again and maybe again. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an ongoing and what may be quite a long process. So there will be not only the 800 or so who are there now but also others who will almost certainly take their place in due course. There are others who have done their duty and have returned. Even if they do not return to the Gulf, they have also done their duty. All those young men, and now some women, deserve our great gratitude, but they also deserve our support. It is also most important that they should know that, overwhelmingly, not only the Government and the Opposition, not only the Parliament of this country, are behind them, although I am sure that is important, but they should know that the overwhelming majority of Australians are supporting what they are doing and are concerned about them and their welfare and that of their families. </PARA>
<PARA> Those members of our defence forces who have been engaged already have conducted themselves in a splendid manner, and I think we should be proud of them and we should be giving them our full support. I hope that there will not be the sort of conduct that we had here this afternoon from a very small and noisy minority in this community. I hope that that will not be the impression they have of their fellow countrymen. I am sure it is quite wrong and I hope that they will not be misled by that sort of demonstration, because even if there were a genuine feeling of opposition to Australia's involvement, by those who may not agree with that for some reason, I believe that all Australians should be standing behind those members of our Defence Force, giving them moral support and encouragement as well as, of course, the physical support which is to be given and is the responsibility of Government; the moral support of the whole of the Australian community should be with them in the great challenge that they have ahead of them in this war. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had time this afternoon to deal with some questions which I would like to raise with the Government about the future of the Australian Defence Force both in this particular situation and for the future generally. Senator Hill has attempted to go into some of the major problems. There are some major problems for the world in what is, perhaps, a new world order, as it is being referred to. These are grave, weighty and vitally important questions which this Parliament should be debating and will have to debate even though the Government wants to cut off this session tomorrow. But it is something we will have to come back to time and time again. There are some vital new problems and new questions that arise regarding Australia's defence, our role in the world and our role as an effective member of the United Nations, because that is, in the end, why we are taking part. We are taking part because we believe in the international community under the United Nations and the new role that that will have, we hope, for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We are required to play our part as a member of that international community. We are playing it for that reason and also for the reasons of our own defence. If we, ourselves, were confronted with this sort of threat we would expect the international community to give us assistance. So these are new and weighty questions which we have to ponder in the future. At this stage, let us give full support to those members of our Defence Force who are carrying out the responsibilities which we have given to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that it would give any government any pleasure to be involved in a conflict situation, and this Government has given serious consideration to the factors that would compel us to commit armed forces to the region. I would also say that, having visited and having had contact with members of the Australian Defence Force so constantly over recent days, they take no joy out of it at all. Having been trained all their lives to fight, their reaction was extremely sombre. Let me assure anyone in this Australian community that there are no Rambos and no-one in the defence forces is taking pleasure out of the current situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing that I would like to say is that this war did not start four days ago. This war started on 2 August; it was only the response that started four days ago. I know that my colleague Senator Tate will spend some time examining the circumstances surrounding 2 August, but just to recap: here we had a situation where Kuwait was threatened, negotiations occurred in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and assurances were given to people such as President Mubarak, all of which were just a disguise for what eventually was naked aggression against a sovereign country. When Iraq invaded Kuwait, I wonder where the demonstrators were that day-outside the Iraq Embassy? No, they were not. Not a peep; not a whimper; no response whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA> The initial reaction of the international community, I thought, was a most sensible one in which a two-pronged attack was made-firstly, sanctions and, secondly, on the diplomatic front. Both those have been adequately dealt with by my colleague Senator Evans. But I remind the Senate that 28 nations are involved in this exercise and many others are giving support where they cannot make a military contribution. Some people would assert that this is just the crusty conservative Western world intervening in its old imperialistic ways. I do not think that is true of anyone who has intervened, but it is not this Government by itself that has made these decisions. It is a social democratic government. Neil Kinnock, the Leader of the British Labour Party, has been in fulsome support of British intervention. Mitterrand and Rocard from France and probably the greatest Italian socialist leader since the Second World War-Craxi-have similarly expressed views. The President of Czechoslovakia, a man who spent many years in prison, has come out in full support. So these decisions are not just `American lap-dog responses'. These responses are made from the widest section of political ideology, from conservatives right through to radicals. They have come to the conclusion and to the world view that aggression in this region must be resisted. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the nations which in the last four days have come out in strong opposition, we see that the first to do so was Cuba-the paragon of democracy in the Caribbean which has exported terrorism and revolution throughout Central and South America. What a great example to have to align oneself with. The second country was North Korea-one of the worst autocracies and military dictatorships in the world which is hell-bent on a nuclear weapons program. The third was Yemen-hardly the most progressive country, even by Middle East standards. Those are the three countries that have been so bitterly critical of the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's intervention in these matters is based very firmly on our supporting the United Nations. I cannot stress that too much. Someone said to me this morning, `How would Evatt have felt if he had been involved in this debate today?'. He is someone who spent many years of his life, with the support of others, trying to get a constructive United Nations and a new world order in which countries could live at peace with each other. I certainly know on which side of the debate he would have spoken if he had had the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Our commitment in this region is commensurate with our size and the role that we see ourselves playing in the world. It is not a large one; we are not a world power. However, our contribution has been crafted to where deficiencies exist. When the Chief of the Defence Force, General Gration, was touring the Middle East in November, in advance of my visit, it was made very clear to him by the coalition forces that the shortage areas were escort ships and medical teams. That is precisely where we have made our contribution. Currently we have two escort ships and a supply ship in the Gulf. That contribution will continue. When Success has finished its rotation of duty it will be replaced by Westralia. We have four medical teams of 10 also because there was a major shortage in that area. On top of that, we obviously have a logistical support team. Finally, 20 of our serving personnel are on exchange rotation in the Gulf doing a diverse number of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senator Durack for his tribute to those serving Australians. I do not think anyone in this chamber would criticise those who are merely doing their duty. They do it not with enthusiasm, other than enthusiasm to do a job; they do not do it out of a sense of militarism-they are as scared as anyone else when the occasion arises-but nevertheless they will do their job with resoluteness, efficiency and a sense of duty to their country. We on the Government side salute them and thank them for their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not true to say that the whole of Australia supports this commitment. I cannot put a figure on it. In political terms, the two major parties support it. The Australian Democrats have made it quite clear here today that they do not. I was intrigued by Senator Powell's assertion that sanctions should have been given a chance to work. I was sitting in this chamber on, I think, 23 August when Senator Powell made her big Middle East speech opposing this Government's decision to enforce sanctions. Using a geographical pun, when did the road to Damascus conversion occur?</PARA>

<PARA>The real problem with the Democrats' position is that, as it is not quite a pacifist position, the Democrats have enormous difficulty in defining what sort of world order they seek. Too often I get the impression that the Democrats think that, by being nice and talking incessantly, a result will come out. They are entitled to that view, but it is not a view that historically can be substantiated. I am quite sure that if we got in a time machine today and this was 1934 to 1940 they would be saying, `Well, the Italians have gone into Abyssinia; let's talk to them; they'll be talked out of it. Let's talk the Japanese out of Manchuria. Let's talk the Germans out of Sudetenland, Austria and Czechoslovakia'. Too many people did that. Too many people in my Party marched just for peace, putting off the inevitable day until the conflict would become bigger rather than smaller. That is the difficulty we have with the Democrats' position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Powell raises the question of sanctions. I thought that Senator Evans gave a fairly good response. From my perspective, I supported sanctions. What I did not anticipate was that in that time Kuwait would be dissembled and abused in the way it was. If sanctions took another 12 months to work, what would happen to the Kuwaitis? What would happen to them as their economic assets were stripped away, as everything that could be moved was shipped back to Iraq, and as anyone who voiced the slightest bit of dissent was shot? The Kuwaitis did not have the privilege of coming in here today and debating these issues. The first person to open his or her mouth with dissent would have been shot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Powell should read the Amnesty International reports on Kuwait and say that we, as responsible nations, should stand and watch that continue-hoping that sanctions would work in six, eight or 10 months, knowing what the climatic conditions are in the Middle East and that Saddam Hussein could have delayed things until those conditions made conflict impossible for several more months, and knowing that people's observance of the various religious festivals in the Middle East would make it very hard in four months time. Saddam knew that. Why can the Democrats not understand that he was just playing for time until the forces would eventually have to be withdrawn? Sanctions would mean nothing then and Saddam Hussein would have been in control of the Kuwaiti oilfields and the resources of Kuwait, and potentially in control of the critical parts of Saudi Arabia. Imagine what sort of war machine he would have built. This all comes back to the question: why does a country of 17 million need a standing army of nearly a million, counting reserves? Why does it need 4,000 tanks and 700 war planes, and why does it need to develop a chemical, biological and nuclear capacity? Why has it developed that and why has it never once hesitated to use any weapon at its disposal?</PARA>
<PARA> The most sickening and obscene thing that I have seen in this episode of events-it was not the result of Democrats' action-was a demonstration on Saturday against the American Embassy. Fair enough, but why stop and demonstrate against the Israeli Consulate in Sydney on the way through? People going about their daily lives have had missiles rain down on them for no reason whatsoever. The real problem, I guess, in trying to confront opposition to this is that it is so disparate. There are the pacifists on this side, whom I respect-as Senator Durack does-and there is the other person with a misconceived world view, whom I can understand.</PARA>
<PARA> But also running through it, not necessarily in this chamber, is the old pathetic anti-Americanism. No matter what the Americans do, ipso facto it is wrong. As soon as America takes some action, down to the consulate, burn the flag. In the meantime Saddam can march through wherever he likes. It is as though there is a vacuum, as though he does not exist. That is the problem; we are trying to confront some of this opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing more obscene or stupid than the argument that it is blood for oil. There is a whole range of strategic imperatives involved here, a whole range of international principles that go much beyond simply the protection of oil reserves. A variety of things has been said by the Democrats here today including the plea about the old parties' argument, but we are used to that. It is more electorally based than anything else. Senator Durack has already covered what I was going to say regarding Senator Chipp's views. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say only one other thing as I do not believe I need to detain the Senate as I have said a fair bit elsewhere. I think that the worst opposition to the war comes from the Queensland antibases coalition. Essentially that coalition accuses me of allowing the Australian-American facilities at Nurrungar to be used to give early warning time to citizens of Israel that missiles are coming. If I am guilty of that, Mr President, that is my proudest moment in politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Parliament of Australia has been recalled to seek support for a motion put before both Houses, and to support the Government's decision to be part of a 28-member coalition to enforce United Nations resolution 678 carried on 29 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the National Party of Australia I support the motion. Resolution 678 reaffirmed 11 other resolutions calling on the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the sovereign country of Kuwait which Iraq unlawfully occupied on 2 August, and to determine to secure full compliance with its decision. The decision authorised member states, unless Iraq withdrew from Kuwait by 15 January, to use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660, and all subsequent resolutions, and request all states to provide appropriate support for the actions undertaken. The National Party fully supports any actions the Government would need to take to enforce the final United Nations resolution, resolution 678. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Australian farmers will be affected by the conflict that is taking place in the Middle East at present through the loss of markets for primary products, and the fact that the $600m wheat bill will not be met by the Iraqis, I can say to this Parliament quite clearly that I do not believe there is one farmer in Australia who would not support the Government's actions which were taken in sending forces to the Middle East to enforce the removal from Kuwait of Saddam Hussein. Primary producers know that unless problems are tackled at the source they invariably lead to much greater problems in the end. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 August 1990 the world was shocked and horrified when it learned that Iraqi forces had attacked and invaded the much smaller country of Kuwait. In hindsight we should not have been surprised by any actions taken by Saddam Hussein, a man who has committed the most dreadful atrocities against his own people, using chemical weapons against the Kurdish minority; a man who has risen to power by eliminating and exterminating all opposition in Iraq and being involved in a war that used the most hideous weaponry-poison gas-against his Arab neighbours; a man who has ruled by terror and fear, eliminating any voice raised in opposition or even offering an alternative point of view. That is the type of person the world is dealing with, and anyone here who believes this person will negotiate or be willing to listen to reason is being totally unrealistic himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The world has tried reasoning. The United Nations has tried to negotiate since the occupation of Kuwait on 2 August. The United Nations has carried 12 resolutions, all calling on Saddam Hussein to evacuate Kuwait. Sanctions have been tried but have not worked. On 29 November resolution 678 was carried almost unanimously by the Security Council giving Iraq until 15 January to hand back Kuwait. Despite the pause of seven weeks, and all-out diplomatic efforts by all nations which had any influence with Iraq-the French, the Arab summits, its ally Jordan and many others-all overtures were rejected by Iraqi Government spokesmen. </PARA>
<PARA> On 9 January 1991 the Secretary of State of the United States of America, James Baker, after many attempts to arrange an acceptable date, finally got the Iraqi Foreign Minister to a meeting in Geneva. The meeting lasted 6 1/2 hours. After 6 1/2 hours discussion the only result was that the Iraqi Foreign Minister refused to accept a letter from the President of the United States of America to take back to his leader because the tone of the letter was impolite. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 January, in a last ditch attempt to avert war, the Secretary-General of the United Nations met with Saddam Hussein. He was kept waiting for a number of hours, cooling his heels in the foyer, and was then rebuffed, confirming once again-if any confirmation was needed-that Iraq is not interested in peace. The only statements that ever came from any of those meetings were bellicose, indicating that there was no intention of a withdrawal by Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, there can be no other conclusion than that the President of Iraq wants war with the full knowledge that his forces will be ultimately defeated, and then salvage political status out of a military defeat as happened with President Nasser in 1967. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein's intentions would not stop at Kuwait. He has already attacked Iran. If the world stood idly by and took no direct action against Iraq, and by its indifference condoned the invasion of Kuwait, Saddam's appetite for conquest would be fuelled again and again. His next target would be Saudi Arabia, and then the United Arab Emirates. With the invasion of Kuwait Saddam Hussein controls 19 per cent of the world's oil today. With Saudi Arabia it would be 44 per cent, and with the Emirates it would be getting close to 50 per cent of the world's oil reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not ashamed to stand up in this Parliament on behalf of the people who elected me and say that the world cannot accept a position where a person with Hussein's track record of aggression to his neighbours, a record of terror and fear to his own people, and a record of total arrogance to the rest of the world can be allowed, by his aggression, to take control of up to 50 per cent of the world's oil supplies. That would ultimately be used to blackmail the rest of the world and to fund his war machine to achieve more and more conquests, which would lead inevitably to a much larger conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> There can never be compromise with people like Saddam Hussein. Any form of compromise would be interpreted as weakness on the part of the world and would strengthen Saddam. To those people-and I include the Australian Democrats-with the view that the sanctions were not given sufficient time to work, I say to them that whilst the sanctions may have been weakening the economy, in no way were they ever weakening Hussein's resolve to conduct war. To give sanctions further time to work would have given Hussein further time to prepare for war, a war that he is determined to have, and further time to put pressure on the coalition he has so far unsuccessfully tried to wreck by linking the invasion of Kuwait with the occupancy of the West Bank, a completely unrelated matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations, sanctions and compromise will have the same effect on Hussein as they had on Hitler-they will be completely ineffective. Peace in our time at any price was unsuccessful in 1939, and it will be just as unsuccessful in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The world has supported through the United Nations resolutions Kuwait's right of independence. If that is not achieved, then no country will ever be able to live in peace. All smaller countries will live in fear of larger and more powerful nations. That is the principle I put to the demonstrators who are here today, who have a mental capacity of no more than an hour, and who are having peace marches throughout Australia: if we want peace we will get it only through strength, not weakness. That is why there was resolve between the two massive powers, the United States of America and Russia-they both showed strength. In the end it became a stalemate, but it became peace by strength, not peace by weakness. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not one person in Australia who wants war. Everyone in Australia wants peace. Christians are praying for peace. The actions of the demonstrators are wrong. I accept that they have a right to demonstrate-that is their prerogative. They would not have the same rights and freedom in Iraq. I will stand here today and disagree with them, but I will defend their right to demonstrate. But they are causing concern amongst our defence forces, who are already worried; they are causing hurt to the families of the people who are serving in the Gulf; and they are building up a division and resentment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> They must ask themselves whether they can trust a man who has developed chemical and biological warfare to an art form, a man who has a nuclear capacity and is continually trying to upgrade and develop that capacity. Do people such as the Democrats honestly believe that Hussein is interested in peace? Unless they are prepared to address the issues, the Prime Minister is correct in accusing the peace demonstrators-and I include the Democrats-of uttering mindless slogans and falling into the trap of appeasement. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I was in Washington. I was able to see at first hand the concerns of the people of America. When I come back here and see people mindlessly, as Senator Robert Ray has quite correctly said, marching and demonstrating in front of the American Embassy I want to put forward some of the fears and concerns that those people have over there. They were asking: `Why do we have to have this action of going to war when we are the strongest nation in the world? The Gulf is offering no threat to us. Why do we have to protect the world's oil supplies when America uses only 8 or 9 per cent of the Gulf oil? When other countries such as Japan and Germany are drawing their oil resources from the Gulf, why are they not pulling their weight?'.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite all these questions and concerns, both the Congress and the Senate voted to support the President's action of a total commitment. Where ours is a contribution, theirs is a total commitment and they are the ones who are putting everything on the line. The commitment has been endorsed by 83 per cent of the people. Those people want peace as much as anyone in Australia wants peace. They have been through the years of the Vietnam war. They paid the toll, but they know that peace will be a reality only if dictators like Hussein are stopped in their tracks. </PARA>
<PARA> Today it was my firm hope-I suppose an expectation rather than reality-that this motion would be carried unanimously by every member of this Parliament. But I acknowledge that people have a right to disagree. They do not have the same right in Iraq, Kuwait or any other place, but everyone in this Parliament has the right to disagree. I said that I hoped, but, unfortunately, I am not going to be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> That action would have signalled to the world that we support the United Nations' effort to restore Kuwait's sovereignty totally, and to our defence forces and their families that Australia's elected representatives have total confidence in and support for their cause. Most of all, it would have shown the world that Australia is totally committed to standing up against dictators such as Saddam Hussein who, by their atrocious actions displayed over a number of years, have threatened world peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the motion before the chamber relating to the Gulf crisis in the Middle East, but I do so in a very sombre and reluctant frame of mind. I believe that that mirrors very well the mood of the Australian people, who show no enthusiasm for this conflict at all but regard it as a duty which has been thrust upon us in concert with other members of the world community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have come to the conclusion that I believe most Australians have, that Saddam Hussein must be ousted from Kuwait by force. I will outline the reasons for coming to that conclusion. It goes against every inclination of my personality and the reason why I entered politics. It has not been an easy path but, as I say, I believe that I share the general mood of the Australian people in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not a nation of warmongers. We take no delight in waging war. The Australian characteristic is to honour the dead-those who fall in conflict-and to look after those who are repatriated to Australia having served in the armed forces abroad, but we do not glorify war. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that is an immediate and absolute contrast with the society controlled by Saddam Hussein. He is undoubtedly a murderous despot. He has moulded that society so that its very being requires the waging of war to give it political meaning and cohesion. It seems to take its very identity and substance from the waging of war, whether it is against Iran over eight years at the cost of one million lives for no territory gained at all, or against its own inhabitants, the Kurds, whose crumpled bodies we saw huddled in the alleyways of their villages-women and children. We saw in the hospital beds the blistered bodies of those who survived, as opposed to those corpses that were heaped in the quarters of the Kurdish villages. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, by contrast and thankfully, there is no enthusiasm for the war here. To my mind the contrast is well epitomised by the fact that whereas Saddam Hussein has called for a jihad-a holy war-there is no call for a crusade here in Australia. We are not back in medieval times. There is no underlying religious or racist sentiment-whether express or covert-motivating or fuelling the commitment of the Australian people to this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we come to this position very reluctantly. I have heard no speech here of a warmongering type. There is a reluctant sense of doing what has to be done. I do not believe that it should be any other way. We have been chastened by the Vietnam experience into being cynical about the motives of those who undertake war-whether our allies or others-and we properly scrutinise those commitments to conflict involving, as they do, the killing of other human beings. But I believe that, while we do not glorify war, we have to make the commitment in this particular instance. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the Australian Muslim and Arab communities also ought to be commended for the way in which they have conducted themselves during these weeks and months of the very tense times in the Australian community. Two Fridays ago I had the honour and privilege of attending the Friday prayers at the Lakemba Mosque in Sydney and I visited the mosque in Hobart, the capital of my home State. I spoke and listened to the sermons of the Imam al-Hilaly in Sydney and the Imam Fattah in Hobart. I heard each strongly commit his community to the non-violent and peaceful expression of either support or dissent in respect of government policy. They assert it and they are entitled to the same rights as all other citizens of Australia and inhabitants of this great Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I assured them on our part, as has the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) constantly, that the rest of the Australian community was expected to show tolerance and decency and allow them to go about their life in Australia and express their dissent, if they so wished, without harassment or intimidation or certainly any violent outbursts against those communities. It is a great sign of the strength of our multicultural maturity now in Australia that, thankfully, that has largely been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline the facts and values which lead me to support the motion. If I speak in terms of a just war, it is only in so far as it may serve to establish a just peace. Peace is not simply the absence of war but a situation where justice prevails. It is quite clear that peace did not prevail in Kuwait between 2 August and 16 January. Peace was not shattered by the use of force to oust Saddam Hussein on 16 January. This is a matter which the opponents of Australia's commitment and the United Nations commitment to the use of force refuse really to come to grips with. There was no situation of peace in Kuwait from 2 August onwards; there was a state of violence, an absolute lack of peace. There was a regime of terror, which has been the fate of the inhabitants of Kuwait since that fateful day of 2 August. </PARA>
<PARA> What has occurred there is revolting to human decency and has been totally outlawed by the world community. There has been a call for the liberating of the inhabitants of Kuwait and the remedying of a situation in accordance with international law. I will use only one source to illustrate the lack of peace since war was waged by invasion of the aggressor, Saddam Hussein, against Kuwait-and that is the Amnesty International report entitled Iraq/Occupied Kuwait: Human Rights Violations Since 2 August. It is a publication dated 19 December 1990. Amnesty International is a well respected organisation. In fact, many members of this chamber on all sides of politics are members of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group. The index indicates the reading contained in this report. It includes:</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Arbitrary arrests, detention without a trial and ``disappearances''</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Torture and ill-treatment of detainees</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The death penalty</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Extrajudicial executions</PARA>
<PARA>They are just some of the headings of the pages and pages that catalogue the horrific oppression and brutality undertaken by the occupying forces. I note some of the covering remarks made by Amnesty International. In the press release accompanying the report, Amnesty International states:</PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International has called on the Iraqi government to follow the release of hundreds of Western nationals by ending the imprisonment, torture and killing of thousands of people in Kuwait . . . Amnesty International details how Iraqi forces have tortured and killed many hundreds of victims, taken several thousand prisoners and left more than 300 premature babies to die after looting incubators from at least three of Kuwait City's main hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>I will go into that later. The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The report catalogues 38 methods of torture used by the Iraqi military, including cutting off people's tongues and ears, shooting them in the limbs, applying electric shocks to their bodies, and raping them. </PARA>
<PARA>Another press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> Doctors who worked in Kuwait's hospitals following the invasion said Iraqi soldiers brought in scores of bodies of young men, many of whom were shot at close range in the heart and head. The doctors were forced to issue death certificates saying the victims had died after arrival at the hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Scores of hangings have also been reported in the grounds of Kuwait University of people suspected of opposing Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. Those hanged were summarily executed after being accused of criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA>There are case examples. This is a well documented report, as one would expect from Amnesty International. I will read the case of Sana' Al-Nuri, a 25-year old law student at Kuwait University. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> According to eyewitness reports, she was killed on 8 August when Iraqi troops fired at a group of some 35 women demonstrating peacefully in al-Jabiriyya against Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. Another woman in her mid-20s was also reported to have been killed in the same incident, as well as two boys aged 13 and 16 who died after being shot in the head and heart respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>What moved me most in the catalogue of horror in this report is contained on page 56. I will read it in full:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, over 300 premature babies were reported to have died after Iraqi soldiers removed them from incubators, which were then looted. Such deaths were reported at al-Razi and al-'Addan hospitals, as well as the Maternity Hospital. According to a Red Crescent doctor:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Premature babies at the Maternity Hospital died after Iraqi soldiers took them out of the incubators. This happened in August, in the early days of the invasion. A total of 312 babies died in this way. I personally took part in the burial of 72 of them in al-Rigga cemetery.''</PARA>
<PARA>Another doctor working at al-'Addan Hospital, whose brother was a volunteer grave-digger, reported that 36 premature babies were buried in one day alone in August. An eyewitness account of such deaths at al-'Addan Hospital was provided by a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, who testified before the United State Congressional Human Rights Caucus on 10 October:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The second week after the invasion, I volunteered at the al-'Addan Hospital . . . I was the youngest volunteer. While I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns, and go into the room where 15 babies were in incubators. They took the babies out of the incubators, took the incubators and left the babies on the cold floor to die. It was horrifying.''</PARA>
<PARA>And there is more. Having read that report, I find it impossible to maintain that it is never justified to use military force to remove a tyrant. </PARA>
<PARA> I have moved to the same painful conclusion as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great famous German pastor, who found himself against every previous understanding he had of the claims of the gospel. This great pastor, particularly amongst the youth of Germany, involved himself in the assassination plot against Hitler because he came to the painful, reluctant conclusion that he had to be part of the process of removing a tyrant who was claiming the lives of so many innocent victims. I may be grievously wrong in coming to this conclusion; I may be being mislead by the same demonic force which animates the Iraqi regime-and I believe it is. But if so, I will have to bear responsibility for acting against the purpose which the creative spirit has for humanity. I have concluded that there is just cause for the world community to have resolved to act as it is acting. </PARA>
<PARA> To reiterate: quite apart from the invasion, itself a clear breach of international law, the behaviour of the occupying forces, which is totally consistent with the atrocious cruelties meted out to the Kurds, is a clear breach of the Geneva Conventions. The Fourth Geneva Convention-and Iraq is a party to this convention-which is meant to humanise, so far as is possible, the conduct of war, states the following in article 147:</PARA>
<PARA> Art. 147. Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the present Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a protected person, compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power, or wilfully depriving a protected person of the rights of a fair and regular trial prescribed in the present Convention, taking of hostages and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to almost all those matters there has been clear, documented violation of those particular requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The perpetrators can be held personally responsible, if they can be identified at the end of this conflict, and their superior officers, of course, can be prosecuted in any domestic jurisdiction. They have clearly breached international law, as documented by Amnesty International, and common decency would say they are in breach of all those bonds which ought to unite the human family, of whatever race or creed, which shares this very small planet. Unless conventions such as the Geneva Convention are upheld and enforced, the horrors of warfare experienced by innocent civilian inhabitants of an invaded country like Kuwait will continue. I do not believe anyone can stand by and ignore the pleas to our common humanity. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that Senator Jo Vallentine is not in the chamber. I think Senator Vallentine has a total pacifist position, which accorded with my views, and I can respect that total commitment to the principle that one should never kill another human being for whatever apparently just or good reason. I may still pray to be able to resist killing an aggressor against me personally, but I do not believe I could in good conscience refuse to kill a barbarian killing babies in a maternity hospital. The wails and pleas of those babies cry out for our aid. I say `our' aid because it is our collective responsibility to come to the assistance of the most vulnerable and the most weak. Certainly, the babies of Kuwait are only one example of that vulnerable and weak population of inhabitants of that very small nation state, a member of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if I am right-and I think I have illustrated just cause for our intervention-it would only be justified if it were truly as a last resort. Many people have spoken of the exhaustion of diplomacy and I do not completely want to go over that ground again but I need to in order to exhibit why I have come to the conclusion I have. There is no doubt-and it is often forgotten-that when people speak, for example, of an Arab solution being preferable to that imposed by the United Nations, that Arab diplomacy exhausted itself in late July. In a press clipping from 27 July 1990 President Mubarak, the Egyptian President, who, the article says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . made a whirlwind peace-keeping tour of Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, said the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, had assured him he would not launch his million-strong armed forces against his small southern neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA>Arab diplomacy thought it had secured Kuwait from the threat of invasion, aggression and occupation when it got that undertaking given personally by President Hussein to President Mubarak of Egypt. Within two or three days the invasion took place in complete contradiction to the undertakings which were given. It indicated Saddam Hussein's contemptuous disregard for his Arab brothers and a repudiation of the undertaking he had given them. The invasion of 2 August indicated he would be unmoved by the pleas of the Arab world, and why would he not? After all he is the one who aspires to leadership of that world-his pan-Arab pretensions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it also has to be emphasised, because these things are forgotten, that the date originally set by the United States in, as I recall, the pre-Christmas period was 1 January 1991. However, the world community said, `No, that is too early' and the Security Council set 15 January as the date. That was to give world leaders, particularly those such as the Russians and the French, who had historic alliances with Iraq, time to negotiate and to seek a compromise. I do not refer to all the leaders of the world who came to the same sad conclusion, but let us listen to what President Mitterrand said in relation to the vote of the National Assembly of France. On 16 January the National Assembly approved the use of force by 523 votes to 43 votes after Mitterrand and his socialist Prime Minister, Michel Rocard, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Iraq's stubborn silence on a withdrawal from Kuwait had left France no other option.</PARA>
<PARA>I say this to my Australian Democrat senator friends: They have to take into account the very close historical alliances and understandings that nations like France and Italy-and in a moment I will quote Craxi-have with Iraq. This is what President Mitterrand said:</PARA>
<PARA>I say it with regret but with determination: the use of armed force to oblige Iraq to evacuate Kuwait is now legitimate . . . France is not Iraq's enemy . . . Unfortunately not a single sign, not a single word from Baghdad gave hope that it would submit to the requirements of law. </PARA>
<PARA>In Italy, Craxi, the leader of the Socialists-I quote him because they are from fraternal parties-said in his speech to the Italian Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday, on his way back from his talks in Baghdad Daniel Ortega told me that the one word Saddam Hussein intends not uttering is the word withdrawal. But that is the very first word that he should utter-and should have already uttered. </PARA>
<PARA>Craxi goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to see how what is happening can still be called an American affair, a product of American imperialism, an adventure generated by American interests. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Never before has the international community been so united, so determined to achieve a common goal, in asserting a principle, in asking that the UN resolutions be respected. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me quote him a little more at length:</PARA>
<PARA> We have seen many dictatorial regimes throw themselves into military adventures in the conviction or the illusion of victory. But never before have we witnessed a regime issuing a challenge of war, knowing full well that it will lose. All this has coloured the conduct of the Iraqi regime with such irrationality and fanaticism, that it is beyond our horizon, removed from the principles in which we believe, from our desire to see every contest be the subject of dialogue and negotiations. It is removed from the peaceful and pacifist spirit of our tradition, the tradition of men and women of peace . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that I stand, as do other senators in this chamber, in that tradition of dialogue and negotiation and of the seeking of peace, but we are confronted with a phenomenon that we, in our blessed Commonwealth of Australia, have never had to confront before. It is that of the absolutely fanatical and obdurate decision of Saddam Hussein to conduct his country's affairs in this warlike way, to the great terror of surrounding neighbours and indeed to the inhabitants of his own land. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an exhaustion of diplomacy amongst the Arabs and amongst the members of the European community, including the Russians who were very close to Saddam Hussein's regime. I think it was all summed up for me in the face, which I recall seeing on television, of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Perez de Cuellar. One could see the failure of his mission, the great disappointment, the fact that he had been kept in humiliating circumstances waiting in the foyer hour after hour by Saddam Hussein; he was deliberately humiliated. He came away with a great sadness which he so eloquently expressed on behalf of the world community. On 15 January, the Secretary General issued this statement from New York:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I most sincerely appeal to President Saddam Hussein to turn the course of events away from catastrophe and towards a new era of justice and harmony based on the principles of the United Nations charter./ . . . I wish to assure him, on the basis of understandings that I have received from governments at the highest level, that neither Iraq nor its forces will be attacked by those arrayed in the international coalition against his country./ . . . Peace in the region requires that all of its problems be resolved justly and equitably, in accordance with the principles of the charter of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>I have every assurance, once again from the highest levels of government, that with the resolution of the present crisis, every effort will be made to address, in a comprehensive manner, the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the Palestinian question. I pledge my every effort to this end. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in the tenth and final year of his tenure of that august office on behalf of all the nations of the world, made that heartfelt plea, and he was repudiated. Diplomacy has been exhausted. It is a very sad conclusion to come to, but I believe it is a conclusion shared by persons who are naturally in our tradition-the Australian tradition-of seeking everything short of war in order to resolve international conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA> That having been exhausted, I have to ask my friends, the Democrat senators: How many more weeks, how many more months do we give to Saddam Hussein before we are forced to oust his occupying forces carrying out the brutality and the pillage that they are undertaking under his orders in Kuwait? I have to pose these questions. I do not do it in a way that is meant to put blame or guilt. </PARA>
<PARA> What further atrocities are tolerable? What further attacks will there be on the maternity hospitals of Kuwait and the laying of premature babies on the bare, cold tiles of the maternity hospital today? How many more are to be allowed to die before we invade and try to oust those particular torturers and brutalising militaristic agents of Saddam Hussein? We really have to ask: Where do the killings, the rapes, the disappearances, the forced deportations of not tens, not hundreds but thousands of Kuwaitis end? When is the threshold reached where our compassion requires active intervention even though that active intervention will bring about death? The fact is that people are still being tortured, still being raped, still being murdered and still being deported and they are crying out for our help. I believe that there is a case for international solidarity. I believe that there is a common humanity. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I have come to the conclusion that, whereas I may resist, I hope, the urge to kill an assailant or an aggressor who is attacking me personally, when I hear the plea of the innocent, vulnerable and the especially weak I realise that I must stand between that person and the aggressor. But, further, with the greatest sadness if one has to kill the assailant or the aggressor, having exhausted every type of negotiation and diplomacy then I believe that is where we must stand as a nation in concert with other nations around the world. We have every evidence of Hussein's preparedness to terrorise civilian populations. The lobbing of scud missiles which of themselves are inaccurate into the civilian centres of Israel-Tel Aviv and Haifa-and the most cruel gassing of his own populations indicate that this man has no respect for human life. </PARA>
<PARA> Carnage will result from the waging of this further phase of combat. The war commenced on 2 August; the battle has been joined. The carnage that will occur over the next hours, days and weeks will be immense, but it can be brought to an end tomorrow, it can be brought to an end tonight if Saddam Hussein announces his withdrawal and occupation. He is the aggressor. He only has to make one simple statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite confident that the Secretary-General of the United Nations would ensure that Saddam and his country are permitted a cease-fire and the ability to rebuild their relationships with the world community of nations. I certainly hope that he does so, so that the suffering of many peoples can be alleviated and true peace, which is a just peace, can be restored to the people of Kuwait. For that reason I support the motion. </PARA>

We do not hear many superb speeches in this place, but we just heard one then. I congratulate him on the content, but probably most of all because it was a personal statement. It was not an obligatory alignment with a stated position of his Party but was a compassionately and intensely argued personal statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will attempt to make a similar statement, a personal statement. I stand proudly before my Senate colleagues tonight as a member of the peace movement and in support of the position taken by the Australian Democrats on this profound issue. Over the last 20 or 30 years my values have changed enormously. I was born in 1937, therefore the whole of my life-54 years-has been within the time when the ethos of war has prevailed. The ethos of war has prevailed throughout history until now. It is still prevailing. It has certainly been evident to me during my life. </PARA>
<PARA> My father fought in the Second World War and my earliest memories are of the impact of war on my own family and my own life. I was conscripted in 1956 in the post-Korean war flurry of conscription known as the national service scheme. For 20 years I spent my life in and around the Army-first of all, as a reserve infantry officer and later for 10 years in the Regular Army as a training specialist. During those 20 years I was left with a couple of very profound impressions. The first impression I have is in relation to people who serve in our military services, our armed services. I have extreme admiration for their courage, commitment, devotion, intention and professionalism. They rightly have and still enjoy the reputation of being among the best in the world. I admire them enormously for that. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not a nation of warriors; we are essentially a nation of peace seekers. I in no way detract from that very positive association with those who serve, who have served and still serve. I think I understand why and how they serve and I admire them enormously for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The second impression I have is reinforced by the fact that essentially I am a teacher-I was an educator most of the time in the Army-and student of history. As a senator, at the age of 54 I have slowly but surely reached the conclusion that all war is profoundly futile and obscene. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen rightly says, nobody wants it. I will turn to the question which was so adequately and appropriately addressed by Senator Tate of what is a just and necessary war later on in my remarks. I have not reached the conclusion that no war is necessary. What I am wrestling with now is whether this war is necessary. I think many people are wrestling with that question. </PARA>
<PARA> I have reached the conclusion that the greatest obligation on me as an individual is to contribute to the transition from the ethos of war to the ethos of peace. We are the critical generation. That transition must occur in our lifetime. The transition from the ethos of war to the ethos of peace is in our hands and it is especially in our hands as elected representatives in one of the world's great democracies. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not stand here as a member of a rent-a-crowd; I stand here as a sincere and committed member of what is known as the peace movement. Nobody has bought or rented me to go out and take my place in parades and on the street in support of ordinary Australians now or in the future. I simply believe that it is our profound responsibility to ensure that the transition from the ethos of war to the ethos of peace occurs now in our time. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I agree with everything that has been said about Hussein. He is a loathsome dictator. We all acknowledge that. It is a question of how we deal with such people, it is a question of method. Why are wars fought? Many wars throughout history have been fought at the whim and will and to satisfy the egos of dictators. Probably the majority of wars have been fought for that reason. Many wars have been fought to defend territory, home, house, farm, crops, one's place on earth. Many wars have been fought to defend territory. Many wars have been fought to save lives and limbs of young children and of ourselves. Many have been fought to defend values. Many lives have been sacrificed for democracy and for the rights of minorities to assemble freely and to state what they truly believe freely. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the wars in my lifetime have probably been fought in defence of value sets. The most profound value set is the one that we hoped would prevail in the 1990s-the decade of democracy, the decade of freedom of assembly and the right to speak out, the right to be heard as Australians are being heard in the streets of this country now. Frankly, I believe that today was a sad day when our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) referred to the members of the peace movement in the terms in which he did. He said that they were mindless, that they were chanters of slogans. Sure, they sang the songs of John Lennon about being dreamers about peace. Sure, they chanted `Give peace a chance'. Slogans are brief, short and profound statements of what people feel. The fact that they were chanting slogans and singing songs does not make them mindless. </PARA>

That is a term that another Minister of this Government applied to 3,000 veterans when they gathered at the request of the leaders of the veterans 18 months ago in the town hall in Sydney-a meeting called by knights of the realm, the leaders of a generation of fighting soldiers and ex-servicemen. They went along and made a statement to the Government, only to be called a rent-a-crowd. The same mindless expressions were used then. The same mindless, appallingly insulting tags were placed upon people who fought for the freedom of assembly and the right of speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sadly, I think that the debate in this country today took a very sour note when the Prime Minister mindlessly abused people exercising the right of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. The same Prime Minister was desperately emotional when referring to a crowd of people who assembled in Tiananmen Square, who were exercising, pleading, with their dictators and tyrants for the rights to assemble, for the rights of democracy. Could they be reasonably described as rent-a-crowd? Who rented them?</PARA>
<PARA> Were the people who assembled in the streets of the countries of East Germany and overthrew the tyranny of communism rented? Who rented them? This is mindlessness, to abuse ordinary Australians exercising their most fundamental rights today. To abuse them for the exercise of those rights for which Australians have died previously is mindlessness. The Prime Minister did not call them silly old buggers. That was probably an equally mindless phrase that just dropped off the tongue some months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The second line of allegation is that we are seeing the same faces. For some reason or other people who have been in support of the peace movement for 20 years are supposed to be ashamed of the fact that they come out time and time again and support the same value sets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am not going to ask them that. I do not abuse them or call them mindless because they have supported a value set-freedom, peace, democracy-for 20 years. The same faces appear in churches on Sunday week after week, month after month and year after year, the same groups of people supporting and exercising their value set. Are they a rent-a-crowd? Are they mindless because they hold to a set of values and express them in a particular way for decades or perhaps even the whole of their lives? What an offensive comment to make. Are we as parliamentarians a rent-a-crowd because we come in here and sit and argue and debate and support the value sets for which and by which we have been elected? I believe that a greater exhibition of mindlessness occurs in this place month after month than we are seeing on the streets of Australia at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, I believe that it is mindless to belong to a political party that says, `You will not walk into your parliament and express your own point of view, but like sheep you will go in and in blocks like sheep vote for decisions that have been taken somewhere else'. I believe that that is probably a greater demonstration of mindlessness than we have seen on the streets of Australia in the last few days. Senator Boswell said a few minutes ago in his speech, and he had the right to make the statement, that he hoped that the motion before this chamber now would be supported by every senator, that every hand would go up mindlessly in support of a motion without an attempt to amend, debate, analyse, vary from or make personal contributions to the debate about it. That is what happened in the Iraqi Parliament six or seven days ago. Every hand went up. That is what happened for years in the Soviet Union. Every hand went up in support of every proposition. That is mindlessness. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the issue of conscription. The Australian Democrats will be attempting to bring on a debate about the critical issue of conscription. The Prime Minister of this country yesterday-I do not want to misquote him because I have not actually read the words-suggested that the discussion of or debate about or even the consideration of, I am not sure what he meant precisely, the issue of conscription was criminal and irresponsible. I think it would be criminal and irresponsible not to deliberate and not to debate the issue of conscription in relation to a war which could be a massive and prolonged war and for which Australians could be conscripted unless we obstruct that possibility. Do not tell me they could not be conscripted. They were conscripted for the First World War, the Second World War, the Vietnam War and they were conscripted after the Korean War, when it was all over, in the spurious belief that there was going to be a pouring out of Asia of a red mass that would overrun us. </PARA>
<PARA> We have embraced conscription at the drop of a hat. Historically we are a conscripting nation. To suggest that we should not consider conscription and debate it, and to suggest that to do so is nothing short of being criminal and irresponsible, is a mindless statement to make. Senator Ray has suggested that our attempt to bring forward the issue of conscription for debate is a publicity stunt brought on in recent days. I remind Senator Ray that eight years ago my predecessor, Senator Colin Mason, put before the Senate a private member's Bill which, had it been passed by this Parliament, would have said that conscription could not be introduced without a referendum. He introduced it twice and I have introduced it twice, and it is still before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of conscription is not a new-found issue for the Democrats. We have had it before this Parliament in the form of private member's Bills for the past eight years. Senator Ray is being either mischievous or deliberately dishonest in his statement of what our intention really is. I will give him the choice. Frankly, I do not think he even knew that such a private member's Bill was before the Parliament. It not only addressed the issue of conscription but also said that Australian troops should not be committed to theatres of war overseas without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. That has been a private member's Bill of the Democrats for eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister offers his assurances that there will not be conscription. Senator Ray offers assurances that there will not be conscription. I remind the Senate that on 25 April last year the Prime Minister stood on the shores of Gallipoli and offered assurances that Australian troops would not be committed to wars on foreign soil. I wonder whether he meant also foreign waters or foreign airspace. I wonder what he really meant to say when he emotionally offered that assurance to the Australian people on 25 April last year. I am sure that it was said with good intent, but it is now history. It is of no consequence; it is gone. I do not believe that it would have been a mindless statement. I believe that it would have been a deliberate and sincere statement, but even sincerity can be pushed aside by the demands of international relations in war. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to cite the double standards that are inherent in this whole debate. We are hearing about the hideous Hussein, and we all accept that. We are not hearing much about the United States' invasion of Panama or the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, or the Australian endorsed invasion of East Timor by Indonesia. We could go on and on. We are not hearing much about that. There is a lot of selectivity in the posturing about the need for us to commit ourselves to a military strategy when there are workable alternative strategies available. Senator Powell has convincingly, I believe, put before this chamber earlier in the day the arguments that there are alternatives; that we can shift towards the ethos of peace and the methodology and the techniques of peaceful resolution and shift away from the resolutions of the warriors. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was driving to Canberra yesterday afternoon I listened to a discussion on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Fortunately, the ABC still has spiritual programs on Sundays. We hear a lot from experts these days. I must admit I am a little sceptical about who is expert in what these days, but I am prepared to accept the fact that the two people who contributed to this program were expert in what the spiritual dimension of Islam says about war: why would Muslims go to war? Then we heard the argument about why Christians would go to war. It was really a theological debate-which has been so superbly touched upon earlier by Senator Tate-about the theological question of when war is just and justifiable. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened to the argument about Islam and what the Koran said, but I did not really understand it. Then I listened to the Jesuit priest explaining the Christian concept of a just war. There were a number of criteria that had been laid down by people like Saint Augustin, Saint Thomas Aquinas and others to support the theological concept of a just war. Of the five criteria discussed, the Jesuit priest believed that three were fulfilled and two of them were questionable. Of the two criteria of a just war that he believed were questionable, one was, in my terms-I hope that I am not misrepresenting it-that essentially one must make a judgment as to whether there will be greater good in the outcome of a war than the evil involved in the conduct of it. One has to make a judgment as to whether, finally, in the outcome of the war, the good will outweigh the evil. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that he thought it was utterly impossible to make a judgment about the good that would emerge from this war-and who knows how this war is going to finish up? Five days ago I was told that 600 aircraft had been destroyed within an hour; that the technology of modern warfare was prevailing. I am increasingly convinced that the technology of modern warfare has not prevailed. I am told that there could be-who knows?-seven aircraft destroyed by that extraordinary display and execution of the technology of war. Who knows where this war is going to go?</PARA>
<PARA> While waiting to be interviewed for a radio interview about two hours ago I listened to the preliminary remarks, the update from the Gulf. Essentially it said that a whole series of leaders of nations are now saying, `If they do this we will do that', and, `If that happens we will do that'. Nobody knows what the outcome of this war is going to be or how long it will continue. Nobody knows whether the good will outweigh the evil, because the whole thing is evil. It is an obscenity from beginning to end. It is futile from beginning to end, and to attempt to apply such logic is equally futile. </PARA>
<PARA> The other criterion that stuck in my mind was that it must be a measure of last resort. I think this is the criterion that the Democrats feel most strongly about. The theological argument was that the war is just if it is a measure of last resort. Our dispute with the Government and the Opposition is that we have not reached the point of last resort. Senator Tate asked me: how many babies have got to die? I do not know; nor does he. We do not know when it is justified to say that this now is a measure of last resort. The fact is that these criteria cannot apply to the circumstances which we find ourselves addressing in this particular situation. </PARA>

The statistics will probably throw light on the level of its obscenity. I do not think they will really help us in any way to arrive at the answer to those two criteria of whether more good will come from it than evil or whether it is truly a measure of last resort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very briefly, I would like to address myself to a question which was put to me earlier in the day by my friend-and I mean that quite sincerely-Senator Michael Baume when, during demonstrations in the gallery, he turned to me and said sincerely, `Paul, does this make you proud? Does it make you proud to hear people expressing to this chamber their feelings about this issue?'. I can answer him now that I certainly do not feel ashamed that Australians are able to come into their Parliament and listen to debate. I do not feel ashamed of the fact that Australians felt moved to assemble outside their Parliament and to come in here. I do not feel ashamed that some of them felt strongly enough to interject and shout out. I was proud of the way in which the President of the Senate responded to that. It was handled with justice, understanding, perception and sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA> I must admit that I was not particularly proud of the fact that some members of the Senate shouted out that they should go and have a wash, have a bath and that perhaps it would be the first bath they have had. I do not know whether there is a smell test applied in this country as to who can and cannot have feelings, and who can and cannot express their feelings. My answer to Senator Baume is that I was not ashamed about what occurred in this chamber today; nor was I ashamed about the manner in which we responded to it. The fact is that this is a very profoundly challenging issue. I congratulate Senator Tate for addressing it as such in personal terms. He genuinely attempted to convince us and the Australian people as to why he has taken the position he has. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that my position is a sincere one, arrived at as a result of personal experience and deliberation over this issue. I believe that there are millions of Australians out there who hold their position sincerely and not mindlessly. Frankly, I believe that today the debate in this nation took a tragic turn when the Prime Minister of the country failed to acknowledge the fact that in this beautiful democracy that we have we should expect and be proud of the fact that Australians can protest about things with which they do not identify. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to the Senate the amendment which my colleague Senator Coulter will later move on behalf of the Democrats. Hopefully, a motion will be put before the Senate for its consideration which is not designed exclusively to endorse a military solution to these problems but which acknowledges openly and honestly the fact that other solutions are available and could possibly be effective if given a chance. My statement essentially has been a personal one. I make it in complete support of the position that has been taken by my Party on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to congratulate Senator Powell on the manner in which she has placed the position of both the Democrats and the people in the peace movement before the Australian nation over the last several weeks. The fact that we are placing it before the Parliament now in the form of an amendment to this motion makes me extremely proud. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleagues would know, I am not accustomed to prefacing the speeches I make in this chamber by commending Government members for their speeches. But today, the speeches of Senators Gareth Evans, Robert Ray and Tate, each in their separate ways, have made an important contribution to this debate, which has to be probably the most important debate that most of us in the Senate will ever take part in. Indeed, in many respects I could have put my name to Senator Robert Ray's speech. I welcome the very clearly demonstrated concern for the troops under his authority and his understanding of their commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said earlier today, and I dare say it will not be said for the last time, that probably the most awesome responsibility that a Prime Minister of a nation can ever undertake is that of committing the men and women of his Defence Force to war. The Opposition, as is now well known, has supported the Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in that decision. We must not forget that the aggression that has led us to this stage took place five long months ago; five long months during which there has been negotiation after negotiation and United Nations resolution after resolution. What I found so interesting in Senator Gareth Evans's speech was the tracing of the history of efforts to maintain a peace. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was a child-a long time ago, I am afraid-the United Nations seemed to most of us to be a bright hope for the future. We had been told of the failure of the League of Nations and we hoped that this new body would solve the problems of the world and give us peace forever. But the growth of the United Nations coincided with the growth of the Cold War and, sadly, we saw the United Nations fail, as the League of Nations did before it. </PARA>
<PARA> When we think about this whole issue we should give credit where it is due and recognise the important role which the United Kingdom and the United States of America, particularly under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, played in ending the Cold War. It is only because the Cold War has ended that at last aggression of the sort perpetrated by Saddam Hussein is able to be dealt with by the nations of the world. It is now possible to get resolutions such as resolution 678 and its predecessors through the Security Council. It has meant that action can be effectively taken to deal with aggression against a United Nations member. Our fellow members of the United Nations have properly formed a multinational force to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> We may not like or approve of the form of government in some of the countries which are members of the United Nations, but members of the United Nations are entitled to the support of their fellow members when under attack, especially when the United Nations so resolves, as it has in this case. The Australian Government has very properly contributed to the force in the Gulf first of all to enforce sanctions and, secondly, to contribute to the allies' war effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the constant barrage of the anti-American propaganda of some anti-war groups and despite the strong leadership role taken by the United States, this is not a US-Iraqi war. It is the sad but proper response by members of the United Nations to the refusal of Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days we have been hearing a great deal about the need for the Arabs to resolve their own problems in their own way. In fact, that has been debated quite extensively this afternoon. I do not intend to go into it in any detail, except to say that while it is a superficially attractive proposition, it does not recognise that the Arabs had failed to find a solution to this problem back in the middle of last year. Iraq's approach to solving what it sees as problems has not been acceptable to most of its neighbouring Arab countries. Their presence among the multinational force demonstrates their determination to halt the aggressor before his ambitions extend beyond Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> There will still be long term political problems to be dealt with in the Middle East when this war ends, but that is no argument for allowing Hussein to sit tight in Kuwait now. The rape and pillage in Kuwait, spoken of so eloquently this afternoon by Senator Tate, seems to be given merely perfunctory recognition by some peace activists when the justification for this war is debated. It is too easy for some to concentrate on anti-American propaganda and to ignore the cruel abuse of the people of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The absence of a democratically-elected government in Kuwait seems to allow some people to ignore the monstrous and cruel deprivation and treatment meted out to the people of Kuwait. I have been astonished and, I must say, even appalled at the depth of hatred of America and Americans which seems to be present in some of the anti-war protesters. These people, who one would expect and hope would use rational debate and reasoned argument, seem to be so corroded and blinded by their prejudices against America. Where are those protests? Where have those protests been? Outside the Iraqi Embassy? We have not been sucked into this by the United States, as some would claim. We have major national interests to defend and matters of international principle for which to fight. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, negotiations and diplomacy have been continuing at a constant and urgent pace since the invasion on 2 August, and the decision by the allies cannot in all honesty be described as the result of manipulation by the United States. The United Nations Security Council made 12 separate resolutions on the issue, and 28 independent nations have taken the decision to commit troops to remove Iraq from Kuwait. I trust that if ever the day should come that Australia were invaded, our fellow members of the United Nations would see fit jointly to take action to remove the invader from our land. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that there are people of genuine views who oppose all wars and some who oppose this war in particular. I respect their views, and I am glad that they live in Australia where they are free to express those views rather than in Iraq or Kuwait where such views expressed bring death. Peace in the Middle East will not come by wishful thinking, nor even by demonstrations, let alone by stunts such as we have seen in this chamber from the gallery today. But it cannot come by appeasement. Sadly, it seems, too few have studied the history of dealing with tyrants, because tyrants cannot be appeased successfully. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who supports world terrorism as well as gassing his own people. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with a man who has called on Iraqis to mount a terrorism campaign around the world against civilians. Even in the furthest point in the world from Iraq, peaceful Tasmania, the need to guard against terrorism can now be seen. People, Australian citizens, going about their lawful business cannot leave a car unattended for five minutes beside an airline terminal while they help the elderly or the infirm with their luggage. That such measures should be necessary speaks volumes for the type of war that we are facing and the mentality of the man whom some would appease. </PARA>
<PARA> All wars are indeed evil, but I am convinced that there are occasions when the greater of two evils is not to go to war against an aggressor. To sit by and allow others to be treated as the people and the babies of Kuwait have been treated and as the people of Israel have now been treated is quite unconscionable. I could not pass by on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> Our part in the war effort can only be hindered by a lack of unity in our country now that we are at war. There have been cruel and misguided efforts by some people in this country in recent days to turn their protests not upon the Government, which in a democracy must take the responsibility, but on our service personnel whose duty it is to obey the duly elected government. This idiocy is not only heartless; it shows no recognition of the long term and disastrous effects of similar action taken against the men who fought for Australia in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years ago we had the welcome home parade to the men from Vietnam. It was a small way of saying thank you to those who felt rejected by their country when they returned home from that war. It was only necessary because so many of those men were embittered and psychologically affected by the misguided attacks on the defence forces rather than on the Government which sent them away. </PARA>
<PARA> Today this country is still caring for many of those veterans with psychological counselling and long term psychiatric care. We know what that treatment did to those men. How dare another generation, with the knowledge of the effects of the previous attacks on the Vietnam generation of soldiers, do that to the current generation of servicemen. As one who spent a ghastly and worried year while my husband served his country with the infantry in Vietnam, I cannot bear to once again see these mindless attacks on our loyal defence forces.Around the country, defence establishments have been defaced, imitation blood has been daubed and service personnel have been harassed and abused. It is disgraceful, and it must stop in the name of justice and humanity. </PARA>
<PARA> Also abhorrent are the tactics being used by some to frighten Australian families about conscription. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) yesterday announced the theft and misuse of Department of Defence letterheads to frighten Australians about conscription. I have also been informed of doorknockers in some suburbs in Hobart who claim that they need to know of 18-year-olds in the household to facilitate arrangements once the call-up is introduced. Former servicemen are also being told that the reserves will be called out and are making inquiries as to the details. Truth may be the first casualty of war, but these hoaxes can only be utterly rejected as cruel and anti-Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> International relief agencies have predicted one million displaced persons from this war. This surely is a mighty challenge to all Australians, including those protesters, to start working to help the victims of war. Mindless chanting by a tiny raucous minority in this chamber, as we have endured today, will achieve nothing except a flush of excitement as is usual with exhibitionists. </PARA>
<PARA> Peace now will not come until the invader is removed, but in that process the world will need to give care and help to those displaced by the fighting. Yet let those who claim to have a monopoly on morality in their hope for peace work to help the victims of war. Let them not delude themselves, however. This debate is taking place today by the duly elected representatives of the people of Australia representing the majority of Australians. I believe in the power of prayer and I believe that it is important that those who believe should pray for peace, but let those prayers extend to prayers for the young men and women who have been sent by the allies to fight for peace and for their families who wait and worry at home. </PARA>
<PARA> The precision bombing that has been undertaken by the allied pilots day after day has not come about just through technology, vital though that is. That high state of technology is obvious and is also present on our Australian ships. That technology would be as nothing if it were not for the professionalism, training and discipline of the people who operate it. Keeping those planes in the air and keeping those ships and weapon systems operating effectively can be done only by people. These are the people we tend to ignore in times of peace but who are essential if peace is to be won. These are the people who, having been trained so highly, must be retained in the Defence Force for the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot afford to go on watching while so many of these young people leave our Defence Force, because it is young people who fight wars: young, active human beings who train hard to achieve professionalism and who need to be ready when called upon, as we have done in this case to help the Kuwaitis. Some people would portray our service men and women as militaristic, seeing the uniform only and not the human heart inside. They do not go to war with a gung ho approach, although they sometimes use that as a cover for their fear; for mostly they are fearful of their duty. </PARA>
<PARA> Those watching television in the last few days will recall seeing a young British pilot being asked what it was like to go to war. He said that it was absolutely frightening; there was the fear of failure and the fear of dying. Other servicemen have expressed it in different ways, often with a self-deprecating attempt at humour. But we have also seen the exhaustion in the eyes of those pilots as they came back from the raids. Some of those servicemen have already been killed or taken prisoner, or are still hiding behind enemy lines. How many more of these young servicemen will die or be wounded before peace is won?</PARA>
<PARA> I have previously drawn to the Government's attention the fact that there are outstanding issues of concern to the Opposition which relate to the protection of our men and women on active service. To date I have not had any word from the Government that they have been resolved. The Opposition is dissatisfied and angry at this failure because these issues urgently need attention. It is not enough for us to sit for two days debating our commitment of our personnel if they are not given fair and equitable treatment for their service. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three areas that need particular attention. I am glad that the Minister for Defence is in the chamber so I can emphasise the points to him. First of all, all inequality of treatment between male and female servicemen under the Veterans' Entitlements Act must be removed. </PARA>

Only today I received a letter from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Bilney, in which he pointed out that these people volunteered to join the Reserve and volunteered to go to the Gulf. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe these allowances and the invalidity provisions available are fair and equitable in the circumstances applying so far. </PARA>
<PARA>By that he is referring to the allowances available to all reservists. He is not referring to the special case of the medical people. It is desperately short-sighted because the Government has not recognised the danger of this approach and its inconsistency with the principles laid down in the Defence White Paper of 1987. It is incredible that urgent action has not been taken on the matter. It has been an important area needing reform since the integrated force was introduced. It is not just an issue of justice and equity for these servicemen. It also will have a serious impact on our defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have no doubt that those who are asked to volunteer will try to do so, as have those who are already there, I believe that when this current deployment is over we will be seriously embarrassed by the resignations of senior Reserve doctors. These are the people who currently enable us to operate in peacetime with only a minimum of senior medical people on the regular payroll. Yet, come an operational deployment, they are absolutely essential to our forces. It is awful to contemplate sending our forces away to war without the necessary senior and experienced surgeons and anaesthetists we can currently call on from the reserves. This then is the third question urgently needing attention and a satisfactory answer from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, in supporting the motion, we in the Opposition cannot forget the invasion and occupation of Kuwait. We recognise that our forces are implementing resolution 678 of the United Nations Security Council. We have full confidence in and support for both our own and all the US-led forces serving in the multinational force and we deplore the unprovoked attack on Israel. Above all, we recognise the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> For those men, women and children who live in all the Gulf countries, the daily developments are more than changing images on a television screen, as they are to us. They are intensely personal matters of life and death. They crave peace, as we do for them. We cannot, however, support any suggestion that a just resolution of the Palestinian issue can be dependent upon the behaviour of the aggressor, the invader. We will continue to work for peace and stability in the region and the first step has to be the unconditional withdrawal of the invader from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> There are already countries which deserve public recognition for their efforts to stop the invader: first of all, the United States, with its strong leadership role in establishing and maintaining the coalition of nations; secondly, Turkey, which has had the courage to allow the United States Air Force to use its facilities, and Turkey's North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies which have publicly declared their support for Turkey; thirdly, the Arab nations which are serving with the multinational force despite the emotional blackmail of Saddam Hussein. Also there is Israel which has shown such incredible restraint after attacks on its civilian population. We must recognise their contribution towards obtaining peace. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this country, at home, have a role-that, having sent our forces away, we must demonstrate our support for them by our unity of purpose. No matter how professional and how well-trained and dedicated the members of the multinational force are, one thing is certain: there will be casualties. Indeed, there have already been casualties. That time, above all, is when we must maintain unity and continue to give them our support. </PARA>
<PARA> Field Marshal Sir William Slim, a former Governor-General of Australia, a brave soldier and a great and loved leader of his soldiers, spoke at Rabaul in New Britain many years ago in a ceremony to commemorate the dead from Australia of two world wars. He asked whether our dead of those two world wars had died in vain. He answered his own question by saying that we should never believe that they died in vain. In a most moving speech he concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in pride and faith, let us who follow them be resolute in duty as they were. Let us leave this ceremony with ringing in our ears a message that was once delivered at such a gathering as this almost three thousand years ago in Ancient Greece. It is a message that those whom we commemorate today lived and died by, and they would, I think, in these uneasy and perilous days, have us remember it:</PARA>
<PARA> Only those deserve freedom who are prepared to defend it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most Australians agree absolutely on many aspects of the current situation in the Gulf and, similarly, most of us in this chamber agree absolutely on many aspects. No-one in this chamber wants war. No-one in this chamber believes that the Iraqis should be allowed to get away with invading Kuwait. Everyone here agrees that sanctions against Kuwait were a good idea. Everyone agrees that the United Nations (UN) should play, should have played and should still play a major role in the correction of the situation. Absolutely no-one doubts the courage and the commitment of Australian personnel in action in the Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> United Nations Security Council resolution 678 of 1990 authorised the use of all necessary means to ensure that Iraq was removed from Kuwait. Obviously our differences of opinion arise over what is necessary. UN Security Council Resolution 678 has one objective, and that objective is to remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the British Prime Minister announced last Friday that the anti-Iraq coalition had no intention of imposing a government on Iraq once it had been beaten into submission. All this must mean that this war will stop as soon as Iraqi troops leave Kuwait. We will then take no further action against Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein is a torturer and a bully. No-one disagrees with that. We have not gone to war over any of his tactics, except for the invasion of Kuwait. If we want to talk about human rights violations, there are a few more places in this world where human rights violations occur with monotonous regularity and a truly gruesome and sadistic efficiency. What about Birundi, what about Somalia, what about Mauritania and the Sudan? What about Sri Lanka where so many thousands of people have died? What about the places where people are tortured every day? Hundreds of people are tortured every day. What about Brazil where young people are picked up by the military police, tortured and thrown on rubbish heaps to get rid of the crime rate in the country? There are many countries in this world that Amnesty International has reported on; there are many countries in this world that Amnesty wants brought to justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one am very pleased that that one report on Iraq seems to have had so much influence on people that sanctions were put in place against Iraq. This is excellent. Let us see a few sanctions against other places. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the key points made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in support of the Government's support for war were contradictory, we believe. The Australian Democrats welcome his admission that the sanctions imposed would probably have worked in time. There is no doubt that all the evidence supports this view. A study of 115 sanctioned regimes, done at Georgetown University in the United States of America, concluded that sanctions have worked where they affect 25 to 35 per cent of a nation's external trade. Iraq is especially dependent on trade and its trade has been cut by 90 to 97 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We are convinced that had Senator Evans been left with the carriage of the Gulf crisis, our support for war would not have materialised so soon. The tragic fact is that this Minister had this issue wrested from him by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who chose to justify war with the following specious judgment given in his speech to the Parliament on 4 December when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Further economic hardship is (not) likely to change the minds of Iraq's leaders. Sanctions . . . cannot force the hand of a dictatorial leadership . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the Prime Minister has redirected Australia's Gulf policy away from sanctions and towards war against the better judgment of most sanctions experts. Senator Evans made great play of the fact that diplomacy had already failed. What he failed to acknowledge was that the timing of the recent last ditch attempts at negotiation was driven by the totally artificial war deadline of 15 January. Had those initiatives been timed to coincide with the time at which sanctions really began to bite-which Senator Evans admitted would have happened, and which was expected to occur only a few months from now-then the outcome may have been altogether different. </PARA>
<PARA> As of last August the Minister held this view. He stated correctly that there was no point in holding serious negotiations until the sanctions had started to bite. He now appears to have forgotten that point. This demonstrates that the push for war, which began within two weeks of the invasion of Kuwait, has dismembered the sanctions strategy, at least for the time being. Senator Evans also claimed that there was no time to wait for sanctions to work because Kuwaitis are suffering. The fact that they are suffering is indisputable and Iraq stands condemned for that, but on 6 November last, Senator Evans told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>It is acknowledged that, if full-scale war does break out in the area of Kuwait, there is a very real danger indeed that the city-state will be very largely destroyed. That is an outcome that nobody prefers. </PARA>
<PARA>As we know, full scale fighting in Kuwait city is highly probable. Senator Evans also claimed that war was needed to destroy the Iraqi nuclear weapons program which may produce a bomb within a year. This is obviously a blatant furphy. A British arms expert, and a former nuclear physicist, Frank Barnaby, on 12 December said:</PARA>
<PARA>The stories released recently are more propaganda than technical reality.</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the Iraqi capacity to make its own nuclear bombs. We believe it would take Iraq about five years to get to the stage where it could actually drop nuclear weapons on another state-if it could get there. The fact remains that a maximum amount of time was not given for the economic sanctions against Iraq to work and consequently for war, hopefully, to have been prevented. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told today that those sanctions were failing to achieve their objective. This is despite the evidence provided by the United Nations committee given the task of monitoring the sanctions, evidence which proved that even as early as mid-December Iraq was suffering badly from the effects of the international embargo. </PARA>
<PARA> From the start of the crisis, however-particularly in the United States of America but also here in Australia-there seems to have been an unseemly haste to go to war. Given that the main strategic objectives of the United Nations Security Council in the Gulf could have been achieved by a firm and long haul strategy of containment and sanctions, we need to ask why there has been this hurry. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons given for the start of hostilities last week are nowhere near convincing enough when one considers the tragedy of what is involved in going to war. As the months ahead will no doubt show us, we face one of the most lethal wars since 1945 involving over one million troops and a strong possibility that weapons of mass destruction could be used. President Bush in relation to this war against Iraq has claimed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . raises the greatest moral issue since World War II. </PARA>
<PARA>When we hear this statement we must recall several international incidents which have taken place over the last 45 years, for which the United States response has been totally at odds with the present day situation. We have heard much in recent weeks about the importance of upholding numerous United Nations resolutions in relation to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. We are therefore entitled to ask: how has the world taken action to fulfil innumerable and similarly worded United Nations resolutions concerning East Timor, Tibet, Cyprus, and of course the other occupied territories in the Middle East? Why is it that in none of these cases has the United States felt it necessary to go to war to fulfil United Nations resolutions?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a strong moral argument here that will need to be addressed in the months ahead and it is very understandable that tens of thousands of Australians have taken to the streets over it. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also note that this war will undoubtedly involve huge costs for all the countries presently involved. There should be no mistake about this. There will be an enormous loss of life in any war, and especially during the months ahead. Massive damage will be inflicted on the major cities, oil production facilities, harbours and other communication facilities which are so vital to the well being of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States military Gulf commander, General Norman Schwarzkopf, has said that in his estimation it could take up to six months to win this conflict. Of course, once the ground troops commence their campaign, and if they get bogged down, that six month campaign could go on much longer. Once again we are being subjected to the militaristic view which promises a short, sharp conflict, but the undoubted air superiority of the United States brought to bear in this huge pre-emptive strike is just the beginning. We accept that the United States led air forces have had some remarkable success in these early days, but the fact is that air power alone does not win wars. </PARA>
<PARA> Sooner or later there will need to be an attempt to dislodge the Iraqi ground forces from Kuwait. We do not believe we should underestimate the Iraqi forces. They are acclimatised and they are used to operating their equipment in the extremes of climate in that desert. Much more importantly, and a point not to be underestimated, they will be fighting in defence of their homeland and in defence of their religion. As opposed to this force, the United States led forces are largely untried under such conditions, and they face an enormous logistic tail that will prove to be a negative factor in the weeks ahead. Efforts to actually eliminate Saddam Hussein or to occupy Iraq will naturally take much longer and cost more in human suffering as well as in economic terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Australia is now involved in a war situation also raises the very important issue of the way such decisions are arrived at here. Honourable senators may recall that in October last year I moved amendments to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill which attempted to ensure that Australian troops could not be sent overseas without the agreement of both houses of parliament. As I said at the time, such a provision is one which already applies in other countries, as we have seen, and it would allow a full and proper debate and a vote to take place before our forces are sent off to war, not after the event, as we are doing at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to say a few things about the way in which those of us in the peace movement, including the Democrats, have been somewhat hysterically accused of being mere appeasers in this crisis. Let me say that I believe it is a sad truth, accentuated in recent weeks, that few politicians in this country understand that to advocate alternatives to war or to oppose war does not equate with a policy of appeasement. </PARA>
<PARA> Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting we heard a fair bit about the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, I think it was. We have not heard an awful lot about the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, when there were not a great many people running to go to war over it or even to impose sanctions. Would those who now accuse us of being appeasers also have accused the United States and the European Community of appeasement simply because they choose not to go to war against the Soviet Union because of that country's actions in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and, more recently, in Afghanistan just over a decade ago?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of Afghanistan, all sorts of alternative measures were employed in an effort to achieve the West's strategic objectives, short of an all-out war. The United Nations was not in the business of appeasing Iraq over its occupation of Kuwait. It took unprecedented action through economic sanctions, enforced by an embargo so effective that even the Central Intelligence Agency had to admit that the sanctions had managed to stop an incredible 97 per cent of all Iraqi exports. Sanctions were depriving Iraq of most of its revenue and of the imports which it needed to develop its military capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Exactly five months and two days-the period between the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the start of hostilities last week-cannot be argued convincingly to have been the maximum time for sanctions to do their job. Giving sufficient time for sanctions and diplomatic pressure to work is far preferable to the tragic loss of life which the whole world will shortly feel. This has always been the Democrats' stated position in relation to the Gulf. Instead, we have rushed into the war option with such enthusiasm that few of us seem to have realised the enormity of the road upon which we have now embarked. </PARA>
<PARA> In finishing, I would like to associate the Democrats with calls which have been made by the Government and, I imagine, by the Opposition that we should have a lot more tolerance in this community towards our own Arab community. Indeed, I believe that some intolerance has been shown towards our Jewish community as well. We should realise that these people are exactly the same as us. They are all Australians and none of us want a war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I rise to support the motion on the Gulf crisis that is before the Senate this evening. The decision made by the Government is correct. I have said that on numerous occasions at the many press interviews I have given since 2 August when Iraq invaded Kuwait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A decision to commit armed forces by any government is the most serious decision a government can make. It can be made only with the full support of the major parties of the Parliament and only with the support of the majority of the people of the nation. Any other formula is bound to end in disaster. It is absolutely imperative, as it is the right decision, that it is supported, and supported by a unanimous decision of this Parliament. We simply cannot put the lives of service men and women on the line and have bickering and a fifth column running within the country, particularly when the issue is beyond dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, when I read the motion this afternoon I wished that it had been worded slightly differently. For example, the first section of the motion talks about the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait. What the United Nations (UN) is concerned about is the occupation of Kuwait by the Iraqis, and the motion should reflect our concern to see the occupation ended. </PARA>
<PARA> In the third paragraph we express full confidence in and support for the Australian forces serving with the United Nations multinational forces in the Gulf. But we also fully support all the other forces that are there on behalf of the United Nations. It is remiss of the Government not to have seen the necessity to include those two points in the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to go through the history of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq; it has been done by many speakers on both sides of the chamber. Quite simply, without any warning or provocation, one country was invaded. It was seized; it was annexed; the legitimate government was expelled; a puppet government was set up; and there followed a chain of rape, torture and murder of thousands of its citizens. Material possessions were taken and the nation was stripped of any assets. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why Kuwait was the object of Iraqi aggression was not any territorial claim but simple lust for money. The Iraqis wished to seize the billions of dollars in overseas assets that the very rich country of Kuwait had. Of course, the promptness of the United Nations action denied that booty to the robbers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to reflect that, just before the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, Iraq gave undertakings to Egypt and Saudi Arabia that it would not invade or use force against Kuwait when it was arguing about the payment of reparations for the debt that it had engendered through the terrible eight years of the Iraq-Iran war. Yet, within a few days of giving those undertakings-to be precise, at 2 a.m. on 2 August-the Republican Guard regiments surged across the border. Hopefully, those Republican Guard regiments are fewer in number as a consequence of the United Nations action tonight, but since then Iraq has stayed in occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> As other speakers have said, this is an absolutely clear and unambiguous case of the use of force to seize another sovereign country. What we have here is the international law in respect of sovereignty challenged, and challenged by people who simply cannot be described as anything other than a criminal gang. They are murderers and they are looters. They are not driven by a political ideology; they are not driven out of necessity to do this; they are purely a criminal bunch on the international stage. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a basic morality in life, and there is a basic morality in international affairs. There is right and there is wrong. Nations have the right to live in peace, free from aggression from marauding neighbours. It is very hard to set up a rule of international law. There can never be a stage where international law is as complex or as detailed as the law within nations, because the styles vary so much. But there is universal agreement around the world on the sanctity of properly constituted boundaries of land. There is no dispute that nations have a right to the territory that is legally within their boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> If one agrees with the proposition that there is a right to have a rule of international law dealing with sovereignty, then one has to agree that there has to be a means of enforcement. Just as every country has its internal laws and a police force to apply those laws, so we have to have a means of applying the basic international law in the international arena. Sadly, the only way that can be done is the same way that it is done in the ultimate case within nations-through a police force. In this case, it is through the application of military power. </PARA>
<PARA> It was because of the universal recognition of the rule for international law that, out of the terrible turmoil of the Second World War and the millions of dead and the destruction that took place then, the nations of the world came together and said, `There has to be a better way. There has to be a way we can preserve peace and stability between nations'. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most moving experiences I have ever had was when I was at the United Nations as a parliamentary observer in 1983. General Carlos P. Romulo, the Philippines Foreign Minister, spoke at one afternoon session at a meeting of one of the committees of the United Nations. He talked about the ideals which led the founders to found the United Nations. He was then in his eighties. He is dead now. He was the last living member of those signatories of the United Nations charters. His exposition of the ideals as to how they sought a system to prevent the outbreak of war was one of the most moving experiences I have sat through. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1945 we have seen the United Nations paralysed by the great polarity between the east, in the form of the Soviet Union, and the western liberal democratic nations. It is only recently, in the last two years, that that has changed. This is why the last speaker was so erroneous in drawing comparisons between what happened in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Afghanistan, where the powers of the United Nations were circumscribed and, in fact, paralysed by the polarity between the East and the Western bloc. That has all gone. After many false dawns, we now have the opportunity, in the United Nations, to provide a system of enforcing international law with respect to the sovereignty of individual nations. That will go an enormous way down the path of guaranteeing the peace that we want. That is why it is so important that Australia-the Australian Parliament and the Australian people-gets behind the United Nations to the very limit of its resources on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> However much we dislike war, as I said before, if one agrees with international law one has to have a system of enforcing that international law. That means that however unpleasant it might be, one has to be adult enough to recognise that peace has a price. We are paying that price at present in taking a military position vis-a-vis the invading forces of the Iraqis in Kuwait. I look forward to the United Nations being supported on this issue. That will bring with it the prospect of peace for generations ahead with an opportunity for success that we have not seen for thousands of years. Even though the price will be quite high in lives and in monetary terms, it is a low price to pay in the long haul. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another very important point in supporting the United Nations on this issue, and that is the growth of the democratic movement around the world. It has not been noticed; it has not been commented on. Just look at what has happened to the old democratic systems of the western liberal democracies-western Europe, the United States, and the old countries of the British Commonwealth, joined after the war by Japan and India. India, the second most populous country in the world, is also the largest democracy. In the mid-1970s Spain, Portugal and Greece took significant steps down the road towards democratic government. We have seen changes in Latin America: Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, even Chile and Nicaragua, have all moved away from or abandoned military and/or authoritative governments. In Asia, we are seeing changes in South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest change of all has taken place in the Soviet Union. The Russian Parliament, under Yeltsin, is moving very strongly on a purely democratic path. It is true that there have been enormous reversals such as in Tiananmen Square, which was a very great blow to the democratic movement in China. What we have seen in the last few weeks in the Baltic states, where the Soviets have moved to crush the independence of the democratic movements, is really quite tragic. But they are temporary reversals in the onward march towards democratic systems. If we can have a rule of law established by the United Nations, the growth of democratic systems around the world will do far more towards generating peace than all the waving of banners and talking about blood for oil that the mindless empty heads are talking about at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with the democratic movement in the past was that there were too few countries. We have now gone past the critical mass and it is a spreading worldwide movement. If we can get that, supported by an international rule of law, we can look forward to a great deal of peace and stability. Liberal democracies do not declare war on other liberal democracies. It is no exaggeration to say that if Kuwait and Iraq were modern democratic states we would not be here today debating this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to convey my unqualified support and the unqualified support of all the members on this side of the chamber for those service men and women in the Australian Defence Force on exchange postings who are doing such a marvellous job for the country in the Gulf region-the ships' companies of the Royal Australian Navy and the medical teams. I take great pride in the way in which they are discharging their duties. But tribute also has to be paid to those from other nations for the courage, professionalism and skill they have shown. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of skill and professionalism, it is worth commenting on the loss rates of the aircrews engaged so far. Looking at tonight's news, it seems that probably 20 aircraft have been lost. With a sortie rate of about 2,000 operations a day-and by now in excess of 10,000 operations have been flown-it is an incredibly low loss rate that we have suffered. It is something like one in 500 sorties-it is a very low figure. If we look at the loss rates in the air war during the Second World War we see that by this stage we would probably have lost, with the number of aircraft committed, somewhere in excess of 600. </PARA>
<PARA> The other extraordinary thing about the skill of the crews involved has been the absolute minimum collateral damage. We have all seen pictures on the television of the incredible precision with which ordnance has been delivered on the targets. What is not generally appreciated is that some of those crews that have been killed have paid a price for that precision with their lives. They could well have delivered that ordnance at a greater distance at a risk of a higher inaccuracy had they chosen to put their own safety first, but they put the lives of innocent civilians before their own. We are all very grateful that they made that sacrifice.</PARA>
<PARA> When we start in a situation such as this we never know how long it will take. I believe it will be a short operation. When I say short, I think it is measurable in terms of months. It is important that the community is held together and supports what is the correct and only decision. The primary responsibility for that is the Government's. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Australian Government's action in this debate. As I said at the outset, the Government has been correct in everything that it has done. But I want to go on to qualify that. This is the most serious of situations that the Government can be involved in and it must be supported by the community. But while the decision has been correct, it is not open to the Government to take the line that it should do the barest minimum in supporting the decision. If it believes in the decision, it should support it to the limits of its resources. </PARA>
<PARA> As an aside, after listening to the previous speaker in this debate, who talked about the need to bring the matter before Parliament, it is quite obvious that the Australian Democrats never understand the Westminster parliamentary system. Decisions in relation to foreign affairs and defence matters are matters for the Executive Government. The Executive is answerable to Parliament in turn. But these motions do not originate on the floor of the Parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the subject of legal confusion, I draw attention to the fact that at times the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seems to think that he is the President of the United States. During some of his press conferences in the last week he talked about instructing the services what they will do and what they will not do. I am pleased to say that the Prime Minister is not the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Force; the Governor-General is. If he has a view, he should convey it to the Commander-in-Chief as a request; not issue a dictate from the rostrum when he is doing a television interview. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's problems are of its own making. Its first problem arises from the fact that it has abandoned the public rostrum to the loonies, the lefties, the anti-UN group, the appeasers and the pro-Iraqi factions. In a democracy there is no reason to deny these people a voice. But the Government has failed-and it has been at this task for seven months; it should have known what was ahead because it was clearly foreseeable-in that it has not got out and argued the correctness of its action. It abandoned the stage; it left it to its opponents. It did that because it is, of course, paralysed by its left wing; it cannot take the decisions it needs to take in the interests of the nation. The Cabinet had a collective responsibility to argue that it is proper to support a United Nations decision. It did not do it. We saw a few exposures of the Prime Minister reacting to situations but never leading and never dominating the public debate the way he should have. There should have been a coordinated campaign outlining the importance of Australia supporting the United Nations on this issue for the benefit of us and of all mankind in the future, and it was not done. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government failed in closing off future options. The Government claims to have moved from a position of high principle, and that is true. Well, if that is true, one does not limit the support. The Government made a minimal contribution of two small warships. If the decision was correct, it needs to be supported, but again the Government was paralysed by the left wing. The Prime Minister was blackmailed into the position where he said, `We cannot make any more contributions.' I put it to the Senate that there may well have been value in Australia having made a greater contribution. One of our assets is the reconnaissance F111s of No. 6 Squadron. They have certain photographic capabilities. Had those aircraft been deployed to the Gulf, it may well have been-although one cannot prove it-that they would have found some of the mobile Scud sites and may well have kept Israel free from being raided and may well have kept Israel, if it chooses to do so, from taking an active part in hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government paid the minimal price to be a part of the UN team. It is also fair to point out that the naval commitment is the least risk. Certainly there is a risk associated with being in any theatre of operations when hostilities are on, but there is a lower risk with a naval force than there is with a force on the ground or with an air component. One of the other questions in relation to this that the Government needs to answer is why the United States did not request the Government, in the face of the minimal contribution we made, for more support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canadians had made quite a considerable commitment; they were approached and in the week before the deadline on 15 January they committed more CF18 aircraft to the theatre of operations. The United Kingdom, which had made a very heavy contribution-putting the 7th Armoured Brigade in, plus a number of naval units and three or four Royal Air Force squadrons-heavily added to its commitment again in the weeks beforehand. I wonder why the Australian Government was not approached by the US Government for an increase in its contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I said this is purely because the Government is a prisoner of the Left. One of the important secondary effects of the Left's control over the Government has been the complete run-down of Australia's defence capabilities. One of the great revelations to the general public of the present situation is how inadequate Australia is in a defence role. Out of the whole Royal Australian Navy we can put four ships into a hostile area and only then after probably $20m or $30m has been spent in a rush on close-in weapons systems and on communications and navigation systems. Four ships in the entire Australian Navy are safe and competent to operate in a theatre of operations. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we have in the Australian Army? The sad truth is that the proud Australian Army does not have one unit it can put into a conventional land battle. It has a very highly trained unit in 3 Brigade in Townsville, but that is not trained for conventional warfare; it is trained for light-scale warfare. We are wholly unable to put any of the 30,000 or 32,000 members of the Australian Army into a situation of conventional warfare in a combat role.</PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Australian Air Force is a bit better off, but again it is very short. It has a strike capability; it has an air superiority capability; it has a reconnaissance ability; and it has a broader range of capabilities ready-to-go than the other two services, but it lacks the essential intelligence gathering capability of an airborne warning and control system (AWACS) component. This has all come about because the public has been fed a diet of `No threat; 10-year warning time; time to prepare in an emergency; continental defence; low scale insurgencies' and all the rest of it-all things designed to justify a very low expenditure on defence. It may be a very salutary lesson for the people of Australia that we are really in a very poor state in respect of our own defences. I hope the Government recognises the inadequacy of the position we are in and does something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to devote a few minutes to the protest movement. The first cab off the rank is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). I opened the Australian this morning and found a whining letter by Mr David Hill, who was complaining about somebody saying unkind things about the ABC. I always thought the ABC through this was the public relations agent for the pacifists' groups. I watched the news in Brisbane at 1.00 a.m. on Saturday and the lead story on the ABC was how 64 Israeli aircraft had been positioned in Saudi Arabia. This was despite the fact that all the other stations had been running a story disproving this report and had been running it for three or four hours; some of the other channels even had Henry Kissinger denying it. However, the ABC with its meticulous research into the situation ran it as the lead story; it was very prejudicial. </PARA>
<PARA> The second story was how the protest groups were taking over Australia and were out on the streets in droves. I forget what the third story was but it was something about loss rates, which again put an unfortunate construction on the Gulf operation. The fourth story-surprise, surprise-was how the protest movement was taking over all around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It was hardly balanced reporting. I did an interview on one of the ABC programs on Monday morning last week; on Tuesday afternoon an irate taxpayer rang and said, `Look, I listen to the ABC all the time. You led the story with an interview at 9.00 o'clock Monday morning in Brisbane on the Rod Henshaw program; since then there have been nine experts and all nine have been totally opposed to Australia's involvement in the Gulf. Where is the balance?' I suggest Mr Hill ought to look at some of the programs that his ABC has been running. I do not know whose letter it was that initiated Mr Hill's response, but on the evidence presented to me I think it is fully justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I will deal with the protest movement itself. The sad thing about it is that all the old Vietnam professionals of 25 years ago have been recycled. They are all desperately seeking a re-run of their past. They have a small group of people like the ones we had in the gallery this afternoon, who are the failures of the education system of this country-or the failures of the teaching profession-having been brainwashed by elderly Vietnam protesters. They are all running the same old argument; we have heard it all before. </PARA>
<PARA> According to them, we are the lackeys of America and the agents of the multinationals. The really worrying thing about it is not the immaturity, illogicality and irrationality of the argument, but its sheer racial bias. The argument quite bluntly is anti-American and anti-semitic. One sees these people on television; they are absolutely quivering; they cannot get the venom out about America or about Israel and the duplicity of the multinationals of those countries. It is a blatant, nasty, racial argument. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Gulf is not Vietnam. It is totally different; it is a different place geographically and these are totally different circumstances. What are the arguments of the pacifists? Firstly, that it is a border dispute of long standing. That is not true; it is not true that the borders are suspect in any way at all. They would stand up before any international court of law. I have dealt with the comparisons with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Afghanistan; they are quite false. </PARA>
<PARA> The analogies with Timor, Grenada and Panama are not true. I do not have time to go through them tonight, but I was in New York at the time of the Grenada uprising. I remember waking up, turning on the television set and seeing the Columbia Broadcasting System, the American Broadcasting Corporation and the National Broadcasting Company wheeling up an unbroken procession of experts saying that what had happened there was totally wrong and that Reagan had gone mad, insane. By 10.00 o'clock that night the C130s were landing in Atlanta and other southern American cities. Students in their hundreds were pouring off the planes, kissing the servicemen, kissing the ground and talking straight to the television cameras and saying thank God they had got out. The American Marines and the Army had got them out. The truth of the situation in Grenada was that its Prime Minister had been murdered and its Government had been seized by a rebel bunch. American lives were in danger and as soon as the American citizens were extracted, the Americans left. </PARA>
<PARA> The other proposition that the pacifist groups are running is that we try some diplomacy. Senator Gareth Evans dealt with that, the Secretary-General of the United Nations dealt with it and Mr Woolcott, the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade dealt with it. The other thing we are told is to give Iraq time; give peace a chance to work. </PARA>
<PARA> If I am a mass murderer, having killed one million people, I cannot plead for time-for 12 months, 18 months or two years-while I make up my mind whether I will recant and comply with the law. There is a need for action now. People are dying. We cannot argue; we cannot talk. If we could stop wars by talking, we would never have had wars in history because there are always people who are loquacious. There are always the Senator Vallentines of this world who will talk the leg off an iron pot. But that is not what happens in the world. A time is reached where something has to be done. The point of the protest movement is that they cannot recognise that there is a time when action has to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The other objectional argument the people in the protest movement have is moral equivalence. They talk about Kuwait being as bad as Iraq. I would not want to live in any of those countries in that region. From a human rights point of view, Kuwait is a model state compared to Iraq. The opponents of the ruling family were not tortured, they were not murdered, the gangs did not rule the streets, and lawlessness did not take place that took place in Iraq. Above all are the double standards of the opponents. There was no protest movement and Senator Vallentine and Senator Powell were not out throwing rocks at the Iraqi Embassy on 3, 4 and 5 August after the invasion of Kuwait. They did not say a word; there were no rallies from them and no crowds in the galleries. Why do they not go with the followers of the movement and live in the deserts of Saudi Arabia on the border. No, it is too risky for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The final worrying thing about the protest movement is that there is every sign that those service men and women who serve in the Gulf will be vilified and persecuted the way the Vietnam veterans were. There are two reports in the press indicating that people who turned out to support the Australian involvement in the Gulf have been physically attacked by the pacifist movement. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are involved in is not uncontrolled blood lust as the pacifists would have us believe. It is not greed; it is not support for the multinationals-the better half of human nature is involved here. It is our love of justice, our love of freedom, our belief in the right of countries to live secure within their own borders that leads us to make the self sacrifice on behalf of others to see this operation through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button. Supporting the commitment of Australian men and women to war is never easy. It is particularly difficult, I suppose, for those of us with a long history of opposing war and whose political career commenced, in my case, with the opposition to the war in Vietnam. Therefore, it is an action which I have come to support after a great deal of personal examination of the issues not only of the case for the action that has been taken and the consequences of acting in the manner we are, but also of the consequences of failing to act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not trying to disparage other people's motives, but Senator Walters can go for her life, she probably cannot resist. I want to refer to the positive opportunities for a new world order which could emerge from this unfortunate war. I also want to examine the alternatives which have been put forward and, on balance, consider what would constitute justification for military action if these circumstances do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say from the outset that I have not been uncritical of the process and the timetable of decision making during the development of this dispute. However, these are side issues which should not divert us from consideration of the primary issues of war and peace. </PARA>
<PARA> In one sense the origin of the war is very simple: on 2 August Iraq, under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait and ultimately annexed that country as its so-called nineteenth province. It is interesting to ask why the Iraqis now think it is a province of Iraq. Initially there were attempts to set up a puppet government, which seems to me to indicate that they actually thought it was a separate country at the time. When attempts to set up a puppet government failed they then annexed it and declared it the nineteenth province of Iraq and decided that it had always actually been part of Iraq. Although whatever one's version of the history of the relationship of the two countries under the Ottoman empire, it is impossible to find a time when they were both ever part of the same country other than both being part of the Turkish empire. </PARA>
<PARA> Much is being said about the ostensible arguments for this invasion. In my view it comes down to two issues-oil and the need of dictatorships for threats, internal or external, to justify the continuing repression of their own people. On the issue of oil, it is clear that Iraq has a dispute with Kuwait over oil wells near the border. I am not in a position to determine the merits of the argument. Even if there were some legitimacy in the Iraqi claims, there is nothing in them that would make war the appropriate avenue for resolution of the conflict. Civilised nations know that there are other more appropriate forums. </PARA>
<PARA> More fundamentally, I believe that Saddam Hussein needed, as all dictators need, a diversion, a justification for the continuation of repression. Dictators always need a constant state of war-civil war, an external or internal threat, real or imagined, to justify their continued repression which keeps them in power. It was this combination of the thirst for oil and the need for a diversion that led to Saddam Hussein's attack upon Iran in 1980 with such awful consequences and to some of the actions which he took against his own people, particularly against the Kurds. He has now attacked two other countries in the region-Kuwait and Israel-without provocation during the past six months. </PARA>
<PARA> A massing of the Iraqi troops on the Saudi Arabian border after the invasion of Kuwait left me in no doubt that, unchecked, he would have constituted a very real threat to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states-if not now, then the next time he needed an excuse to continue his military dictatorship. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to consider the nature of the response. Internationally the response has been remarkably broad and uniform. This has facilitated a unique opportunity for the United Nations (UN) to play the role which its founders hoped it would play at the conclusion of the Second World War. I want to return to the UN and the significance for the UN of these developments shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is particularly significant that the governments of all the democracies are supporting the United Nations sanctions against Iraq. There is scarcely a party which has ever been in government or seriously aspired to government in any democracy which does not support the action being taken to implement resolution 678. It would be mere duplication to reiterate the arguments being put by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others, both in the Senate and elsewhere, as to the underlying reasons for this unanimous support.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote the views of two outstanding international leaders with long histories of commitment to international peace. Firstly, I refer to Gro Harlem Brundtland, the respected Prime Minister of Norway and the author of the famous Brundtland report. In that report, she said some very important things about the perils of war and the nature of international relationships and their economic and environmental consequences. In this instance, Gro Harlem Brundtland, whose Labour Government in Norway has committed ships to the allied cause, said:</PARA>
<PARA> These acts of war could have been avoided if Saddam Hussein had listened to the appeals and warnings from the world community. I deeply deplore that the diplomatic efforts and repeated appeals have yet not been heeded. I sincerely hope that Iraq as soon as possible will realise that the annexation of Kuwait is totally unacceptable and that continued armed confrontation is pointless and destructive. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that what is now happening will be of short duration and that it will be carried out with the least possible loss of life and human suffering. The use of force has been authorised by the UN Security Council and is based on the request from Kuwait in accordance with the right to collective self-defence as set out in the Charter of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no enthusiasm for the battle from Prime Minister Brundtland. As Senator Tate said so eloquently earlier today, there is no enthusiasm in Australia. In Prime Minister Brundtland's words, in my own case and in the Government's case, there is merely a grim determination to do that which we do not wish to do, but which we feel needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> From amongst the hundreds of other international figures that could be quoted, let me also refer to Bettino Craxi, the leader of the Italian Socialist Party, former Prime Minister of Italy, in an outstanding speech to the Italian House of Deputies this month. In that speech, Mr Craxi referred to a conversation he had with Daniel Ortega, the former leader of Nicaragua. On his way back from talks with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, Ortega told Craxi, `The one word Saddam Hussein intends not uttering is the word ``withdrawal''. Craxi went on to say, `That is the very first word he should utter and should have already uttered'. I think that is one of the core reasons why we have made the transition from sanctions to military action-that determination, that evident, apparent repeatedly expressed determination of Saddam Hussein not to withdraw from the country which he has occupied. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am quoting Mr Craxi, let me make one other reference to his speech on a matter to which I will subsequently return. That is the situation of the Palestinians. Mr Craxi said:</PARA>
<PARA>Iraq did not first invade Kuwait and then declare its annexation in order to place the Palestinian cause once more on the world agenda. Saddam Hussein has not torn asunder the relations of the Arab world, placing himself against most of the nations making up that world in order to help the Palestinian people in their battle. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not against Israel that he declared war, but against the Arab state of Kuwait, a member of the Arab League, an upholder of the Palestinian cause, a country that hosted hundreds and thousands of immigrant Palestinian workers. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to come back to the Palestinian issue subsequently. I think that is a very accurate, eloquent and important statement by former Prime Minister Craxi and it pricks the bubble of one of the important myths about this debate. Much has been said during the debate in the Parliament and elsewhere about the positive possibilities of what is called a new world order. I think the significance of this should not be underestimated or disparaged. Some people tend to find that perhaps the phrase is a bit too grand but the idea underlying it is fundamentally important. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the Cold War we have for the first time in living memory, perhaps the first time ever, the opportunity to develop an international community in which the United Nations plays the predominant role in resolving international disputes in accordance with the rule of law. If on this first occasion when the United Nations seeks to enforce its authority in this way it should fail, it will be reduced to the status of the League of Nations-capable of carrying pious resolutions with which all people of good will concur; but which dictators and aggressors can ignore with impunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of failure for the United Nations in this instance are too awful to contemplate. Even those who might have preferred that the attempts to enforce resolution 678 had never been started should reconsider their opposition to its continuation on an analysis of the consequences of failure and on an analysis of the consequences of withdrawing now. The issue is more complex than simply whether one would have preferred the option which is now being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I supported the decision to undertake it then and I am not equivocating on that. But I say to many people of good will who, on the basis of their consideration, came to the view that the United Nations through these 28 nations should not have taken that action, that even if that is their view, they should contemplate the consequences of the United Nations now failing to enforce its decision having once attempted to do so. That is the end of the possibility of the United Nations playing any such role in any dispute internationally. Its credibility will be finished. It will return to being an organisation capable of pious exhortation and sometimes playing a useful role in bringing together the parties once they have decided they wish to conclude hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA> But the role it has the capacity to play importantly in many disputes around the world at the moment, most particularly in our region in Cambodia, and the new role it has shown the capacity to take in resolving issues such as those which are now confronting the world in the Gulf, will be irreparably damaged if, having now started upon this course of attempting to enforce resolution 678, it were to fail. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue which flows from this question and the so-called new world order is the issue of the rights of displaced people in the Middle East, in particular the Palestinians and the Kurds. I have to say that the Kurds tend not to get much attention in this particular matter. A lot of people pay attention to the displaced Palestinians because Saddam Hussein is trying to make them an issue and because they have a legitimate grievance. I have not actually heard Saddam Hussein saying that he is also in the process of trying to find a homeland for the Kurdish people. The only land he gave them in Iraq is that under which they are buried. He has been brutal in repressing those people. </PARA>
<PARA> If the new world order to which so many have referred can be achieved and the role of the United Nations can be significantly enhanced, then these displaced people have their best ever opportunity to have their claims considered and justice prevail. Their position will not be resolved if we, by failing to act, enhance the status of aggressors. Their problems are the result of aggression. It is action to resist and overturn the consequences of aggression that is necessary to assist these people to achieve just resolution of their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> It is only through enhancing the status of a body such as the United Nations and saying that people will not gain the fruits of their aggression that the opportunities to resolve those issues will be enhanced. This is the fundamental responsibility for us all after the war is over. Those who oppose our military commitment other than those few who might support the Iraqi position-there are none in this Parliament and very few in this country-advocate the continuation of sanctions. Others have mounted the argument to explain why these sanctions were not working and almost assuredly would not have worked. Let me say, before somebody picks up and uses this magic statistic that 97 per cent of exports were being stopped and that proves that sanctions were working, that it proves only that sanctions were working in stopping exports. It does not prove in any way that they were working in changing the intention of the Government of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Bettino Craxi-on the basis of advice from a supporter of Saddam Hussein, Daniel Ortega, who went to supportHussein and came away saying that the one word he will not utter is `withdrawal'-has established as clearly and unequivocally as he could that sanctions were not working in the sense of achieving their desired objective. Sanctions are not an end in themselves. They are designed to be a means to achieve a desired end and they were not working in that sense. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator MacGibbon" NAMEID="YH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is probably a valid additional point. I want to refer to one other aspect about this issue of saying that we should not be taking military action; we should be allowing sanctions to work; we should be giving them more time. That sounds like the ultimate in sweet reason from the luxurious distance of Australia. It might mean peace for Australians. There would be no Australians committed although probably they would be there enforcing the sanctions. I want to come back to that point in a moment. But it assuredly would not mean peace for Kuwait and the citizens of various nationalities living in Kuwait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The catalogue of atrocities outlined by Amnesty International on 19 December is too horrible to repeat here. It was very eloquently outlined in some part by my colleague Senator Tate but suffice it to say that it runs to some 80 pages of detailed documentation on atrocities committed during the first four months of occupation. These are only those which Amnesty can document with its usual level of concern for its reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Months and years of relying on sanctions means months and years of condemning the people of Kuwait to extrajudicial executions, which Amnesty International records in the hundreds; so-called judicial executions, after some sort of trial, by firing squad; and numerous rapes and other atrocities that are the inevitable consequences of an occupational army of half a million in a small country. It means saying, `Let us have sanctions for the months and years it takes'; it means the continuation of the 38 different types of torture documented by Amnesty International being undertaken by Iraq against the people in Kuwait. It is not an advocacy of peace to say, `We have sanctions'; it is an advocacy to say, `Let the Kuwaiti people pay the price, not us'. In addition, these sanctions can succeed only by condemning the ordinary people of Iraq to deprivation and starvation. I assume that nobody believes the first person to go without food in Iraq is going to be Saddam Hussein or that the first cut in government expenditure in Iraq is going to be military expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic also to note that those who now advocate the benefits of sanctions are the very people who opposed the original decision to seek to enforce those sanctions. I spoke at a meeting here at which people were saying that we should not have ships in the Gulf enforcing the sanctions. I spoke on behalf of the Government as to why I thought we should. I do not wish to criticise all of the people at that meeting; many were people of goodwill and consistency. But many of the people at that meeting who attacked my position and said that we should not have ships there enforcing the sanctions are now saying that we should give the sanctions more time to work and that sanctions are the answer, as though they had always thought sanctions were a wonderful thing to have. There is no more important debate than the debate about war and peace. In this very important debate we are entitled to demand consistency. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously any normal person would prefer peace to war, but `peace is more than the mere absence of war', to quote someone slightly more famous than I. We need to look at what we mean by peace when we make those sorts of demands. The comments which I made about the people in Kuwait are designed to illustrate that peace is more than the mere absence of war. It is a state beyond merely refraining from taking military action. </PARA>
<PARA> But even in terms of that very familiar phrase about giving peace a chance-a song which I sang out of tune many times during the Vietnam conflict-I have to say that the world through the United Nations, the Arab League, the European Community and the individual attempts by countless men and women of goodwill has sought for five months a peaceful resolution of the dispute arising from the Iraqi invasion. The lack of success of these efforts is entirely attributable to Saddam Hussein and the attitude so accurately described by Daniel Ortega and quoted by Bettino Craxi. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever our reservations about the previous regime in Kuwait, and in my case they are many, it is fundamental to the future of a peaceful international world order that aggression is resisted. The consequences of saying that an invasion of one country by another and an occupation of one country by another are legitimised by the fact that we disapprove of the system of government of the adjoining country is an invitation to international aggression, to regional conflicts throughout the world, and to the proliferation of those regional conflicts. That is one of the risks we face as the old, awful stability of the bipolar Cold War breaks down, which we welcome-but it is a not unqualified blessing because it opens the possibility of regional conflict. We need a system effectively to manage that regional conflict, and the United Nations and its enhancement is the only mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> To continue reference to some of the tragic ironies we confront, it is ironic that that it is the democracies which are defending the al-Sabah regime. There are a few that are not so democratic as well, I hasten to comment, but it is fundamentally the democracies of the world committing their people and resources to defend a regime that is far from democratic. I accept Senator MacGibbon's point that it is more respectful of human rights than the country which has invaded and occupied it, but it is far from a model of democracy also. I note and welcome indications of intentions to review the system of government after the war. It is entirely appropriate that the people in the democracies should get in return for the very significant personal contributions they are making some democratic reform in Kuwait. It is another issue which must be a priority after the war, but it is not a precondition for saying that we will resist aggression only if we like the government against which the aggression has been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude my comments on this difficult decision with the following points: if this military action is not justified in the circumstances of blatant aggression by a powerful nation against its neighbour, resulting in its occupation, when the response is authorised by the United Nations and has the overwhelming support of the world community of nations, what circumstances would justify military action? If this military action against a country which continues to commit atrocities against the citizens of the country which it is occupying, where strenuous efforts for peace have been pursued at multinational and bilateral level, where a five months pause has been allowed to try to achieve a peaceful solution-all of which have been rebuffed, and the Secretary General of the United Nations rebuffed in a humiliating manner-is not justified after this time, in what circumstances is it justified?</PARA>
<PARA> I accept that some people take a pacifist position which says that military action can never be justified. That is a position which at one stage of my life I held myself, so I am the last to condemn it. It is not my view now. I accept that. It is a minority view, but a legitimate view. But once one passes that point and accepts that it is possible to accept the concept of a just war, if this is not such a struggle, what criteria would one set beyond those existing in this circumstance to justify such a dispute?</PARA>
<PARA> It has not been an easy decision, but I, like everybody else in this chamber-at least in the Government and the Opposition-accept the responsibility that being in government imposes to accept the consequences of actions or failure to act. </PARA>
<PARA> Democratic governments around the world have taken the same decision that we are proposing to endorse here in this debate. They have not taken it lightly but rather because they accept that the consequences of the United Nations failing in its attempt to enforce its decisions are too awful to contemplate, and because the hopes of the world for a new world order flowing from the end of the Cold War depend upon the capacity of the world community, through the United Nations, effectively to resist aggression wherever it occurs. Therefore, I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin, I hope that while I am speaking some copies of my amendment will be circulated to other senators. First, I think it is appropriate to say that I appreciate-as others have said-the sincerity with which everybody has spoken in this debate. While we disagree with the position taken by the Government and the Opposition, nonetheless many of the speakers from the other parties have clearly spoken from a sense of deep conviction that what they believe to be in the best interests of world peace is indeed in the best interests of world peace. We happen to believe, from a very strong conviction, that that position in some respects is wrong, as several of my party predecessors have outlined, and we believe that a different course of action is more desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will pick up later some of the points which have been made by other speakers, but I want to make several points in beginning. Firstly, the Australian Democrats unreservedly reject any claim by Iraq to Kuwait, and totally oppose the use of force by Iraq in the annexation of Kuwait. We are not in any sense in this debate or in public utterances or rallies attempting to give any sense of satisfaction to Saddam Hussein or the Iraqis over what has happened. We totally oppose their action and totally oppose the method of that annexation. </PARA>
<PARA> Because several senators have raised this issue, I state that the Australian Dem- ocrats do not in any sense hold the service personnel who are currently in the Gulf region or who may subsequently be in the Gulf region to be in any way responsible in the sense of the actions for which we criticise the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that those people have in all good faith volunteered their services to this country, to the military. They are doing their duty and in no sense should be criticised for that. We note in passing that it was many years before either the present Government or the previous coalition Government overcame their reticence in relation to recognising the service paid by Australian service personnel in Vietnam. There was very little done over a long period to address the social odium that attached to many of the service personnel who came back from that war. That odium should rightly attach to the governments which sent those personnel there-not to the military personnel themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of entry for me into this debate is to pick up on a remark made by Senator Newman when she quoted a former Governor-General, Sir William Slim, who said that soldiers who died in war should not have died in vain. Several other speakers have mentioned a new world order. Certainly, those who die in this war will have died in vain unless that new world order is remarkably different from the world order which I think is being presaged by some of the remarks that I have heard this afternoon. If we do not address the very large differences between the rich industrialised countries and the poor resource starved countries we will simply perpetuate the factors which have led to this war and which, indeed, led to the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button and several other speakers have attempted to say that there is no parallel between the Vietnam war and this war. There are exact parallels. The Americans and the other people who joined in the Vietnam conflagration were very concerned about the resource rich regions of South East Asia falling into communist hands. That war was very much an attempt to keep access to those resources to the industrialised resource requiring nations of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the war in this case is about resources. Senator Tate and several other senators have spoken very eloquently about the atrocities which have gone on in Kuwait; atrocities committed at the hands of the Iraqis. There is no doubt that, as they have indicated, a long catalogue of those atrocities has been compiled by many international agencies. But, it is equally true that those sorts of atrocities are by no means unique to Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> On our own doorstep we have seen the invasion of East Timor by the Indonesians. Some hundreds of thousands of people have died, including babies and premature babies. There has also been torture, rape, pillage and all those things which Senator Tate catalogued. Not only did we not lift a finger to help the people of East Timor but we have actually continued to supply arms to the Indonesian nation. There was no question of sanctions against Indonesia whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon and others may well argue that there are niceties of international law which separate the situation in both positions-that of East Timor and that of Kuwait-and certainly there are. Senator Tate's argument was very much a moral one. But, surely, if the argument is about morality-about people losing the ability to self-determine their governments; about people being raped; about people being murdered; and about people being summarily executed-morally there is no distinction to be drawn between East Timor and between the situation in Kuwait today. Yet we and the world have done nothing in that situation. And that situation has multiplied a number of times over around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> So one must look for another explanation as to why we are so concerned about the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and, of course, that explanation is not very hard to find. It is indeed access to oil. It is indeed the concern that the West, which is heavily dependent upon fossil fuel use, may lose its ability to extract at very low cost the resources in the Middle East. That is what distinguishes this conflict from many others in the past. So the slogan `No blood for oil' is not without very considerable foundation, because that really is the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also say to Senator Tate that the cost of the build-up to this war in 1990 to the Americans was $30 billion-that is, $30,000m-and that thousands of children are dying every day from malnutrition, from dehydration and from diseases which can be readily cured. I just pose the question: if we are really about saving the lives of children, would it not be better to spend $30 billion directly addressing those problems? If we did, we could save far more children and far more lives and provide far more health care and far more education for the world's poor and disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the argument which Senator Tate raised, whilst very appealing, falls quite simply on the grounds of its inconsistency-its inconsistency with the enormous costs of the war; its inconsistency with the failure to act in many other situations; and its inconsistency with its cost in terms of lives which inevitably will be paid as the war is prosecuted. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, if we are to learn from this episode-as I hope we will because it is important that we look ahead-we need to look closely at what has led us into this war and how we should behave as we come out of it. I am reminded of a speech by then Mr Winston Churchill, later Sir Winston Churchill, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> When the situation was manageable it was neglected and, now that it is thoroughly out of hand, we apply too late the remedies which then might have effected a cure. There is nothing new in the story. It's as old as the Sibylline books. It falls into the long dismal catalogue of the fruitlessness of experience and the confirmed unteachability of mankind . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Want of foresight, unwillingness to act when action would be simple and effective; lack of clear thinking; confusion of counsel until the emergency comes, until self-preservation strikes its jarring gong. These are the features which constitute the endless repetition of history. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Winston Churchill made that speech in 1934 about the situation in the Middle East. If we do not learn that the precursors to this situation lie in the way in which the world has mismanaged its resource use and do something about that, as I said in one of my speeches on this subject back in August, we are in for endlessly repeating these sorts of resource conflicts. I have said on a number of occasions, and I think it is quite clear from the evidence now coming forward, that we need drastically to reduce our use of fossil fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> With the first oil price shocks of the early 1970s, I recall in 1972 writing to Mr Doug Anthony, who was then the Minister responsible, pointing out the need to address this question and to reduce substantially Australia's dependence upon the importation of foreign oil as well as cutting down its use of a non-renewable resource and reducing the release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Successive governments have taken no action. Had action been taken to address that problem, we would not be so dependent upon that particular resource and the situation may well have looked very different. </PARA>
<PARA> So the new economic order which has been talked about must not be simply the continued dominance of the industrially rich, advanced countries at the expense of an increasingly impoverished resource-poor world. If that is the new economic order that comes out of this, and I very much fear that that is at the backs of the minds of many people who have spoken this afternoon, we will indeed see a continuation of these sorts of resource wars. If, on the other hand, we directly address the problems of the differences between rich and poor nations and attempt to redress that imbalance; if we attempt, on the part of nations like Australia, the United States and the nations of Europe, to reduce substantially our use of resources and the impact on the environment and to reduce substantially the burden of debt of Third World countries, indeed, we may enter a new economic order. I think we need to keep that clearly in mind as we go forward in this conflict because we will at some stage come out the other side of it and something must be put in its place. </PARA>
<PARA> Our position, quite simply, is that it was not necessary at the time when, shortly after 15 January, active war was engaged upon. Our position is that while United Nations resolution 678 allowed the use of force, it did not mandate the use of force. Many people, Senator Evans included, as Senator Powell pointed out this afternoon, were well aware that it was essential to maintain sanctions for a much longer period for them to have become effective. That is not appeasement. To those who on other occasions have interjected, `How about South Africa?' I point out that this is the first occasion in world history when sanctions have been universally applied by all countries and have been very, very tightly maintained. Sanctions were not tightly maintained against South Africa, and it is not a reasonable comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures have been mentioned before. Sanctions were some 97 per cent effective in terms of exports, and they were certainly very effective in terms of imports. As for the assertion which has been repeated by several honourable senators that if we allow more time Hussein may well have built up his arsenal of weapons, I simply pose the question of where he builds that arsenal from if he is cut off from imports. That really does not make sense. That is a non sequitur. </PARA>
<PARA> Andrew Mack, writing in the Australian Financial Review of 14 January, pointed out that the oil blockade alone has denied Hussein 97 per cent of his export revenues, and the ban on imports of spare parts poses a grave threat to the viability of Iraq's industrial infrastructure. It is quite true, as Senator McMullan said before me, that possibly the last equipment not to be serviced with spare parts would be the military machine, but most of Iraq's military equipment has come from other countries. That, of course, is another aspect of the new world economic order which must change. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticism has been made of the Democrats and also of the peace movement. Where were we when Iraq invaded? I pose the counterquestion: where have the Opposition and the Government been when we have called for Australia not to supply uranium to France, a nation which has not signed the non-proliferation treaty and a nation which was building the nuclear facility in Iraq? Where were the Government and the Opposition then? They are terrified now that Hussein might have access to nuclear weapons. Where were they when we were supplying uranium to Germany? Germany, just before the outbreak of the Iraq-Iran conflict, was supplying six nuclear reactors to Iran and, what is more, building a reprocessing plant so that Iran would have access to plutonium for the manufacture of bombs. Fortunately, in retrospect, that Iraq-Iran war ended that. </PARA>
<PARA> Where was the Opposition when Saddam Hussein was using poison gas against the Kurdish people and a number of nations around the world were supplying Hussein with the precursors of that poison gas? Were they objecting to that? The fact that Hussein is a dangerous madman, an extremely repressive person with respect to his own people, a person who is prepared to march into another country, and who has behaved in that irresponsible way, has been quite obvious for years. Yet nations on our side of the global political scheme have been quite prepared to supply all the makings for Hussein's war machine and for his poison gas and to allow him to get on with the extermination of the Kurdish people and to invade Kuwait. Now we throw up our hands in horror and say, `My, my, isn't that terrible? Isn't he a bad person?'. Where were we when this was going on? We were calling for countries of the world not to be engaged in the transport of military equipment from one country to another, and that has been our consistent position for a very long time. That has to be part of the new economic order if the world is going to enter a safer period after this is over. </PARA>
<PARA> Several speakers have said that there must be no connection between the invasion of Kuwait and the Israel-Palestine conflict, yet those same speakers and, indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself have said that when this conflict is over we must address the situation in Palestine. Where have they been for the last two decades? Why have they not been addressing that problem? Why have they not been putting some pressure on Israel? It is absolutely remarkable that the situation we are now in is going to make a resolution of that problem more difficult simply because the attacks on Israel have now made it almost inevitable that the West will have to do deals with Israel and they will have to sweeten Israel to keep it out of the war and make a resolution of that conflict even more difficult. So, far from helping to resolve that conflict, the way we have gone is to make that conflict less resolvable. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not know that the imposition of sanctions for a longer period would have caused Hussein to withdraw. It may have been that the imposition of sanctions for a further three or four months may have led Hussein to begin a war himself, and we would inevitably have been in a conflict situation. But at least, given the first occasion on which the world community has applied sanctions as a peaceful means of conflict resolution against another nation, we would have given those sanctions a chance to work. That would have been an extremely useful lesson for the world to have learnt. Unfortunately, we have gone backwards and we have resorted to war. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other points I would like to make but I think it is appropriate at this stage that I move the amendment. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Omit all words after ``That the Senate:'' substitute:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) reaffirms its support for an on-going role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations, and in particular the resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait by means of sanctions and diplomacy;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) affirms its support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 661 for support in implementing comprehensive sanctions against Iraq until it leaves Kuwait;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) condemns the Australian Government's warlike interpretation of Resolution 678 of the United Nations Security Council, and calls for an immediate ceasefire, and the withdrawal of Australian warships from combat duty, which is consistent with that resolution;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) expresses its full confidence in, and support for, Australian forces in the Gulf, and places the burden of responsibility for the misguided decision to deploy them to that region solely on the Federal Government and Opposition;</PARA>
<PARA>(e) deplores Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack on Israel; and</PARA>
<PARA>(f) recognises the need to intensify non-military efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats move this amendment in the light of the statements which senators from our party have already made and which other senators will be making later in this debate. We are rewriting the Government's motion in an attempt to pick up some of the differences between the position as we think it should be and the way in which the Government has worded its motion. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel that, given the gravity of the situation, the Government's motion is extremely light. We understand from press reports-and there is no reason to doubt them in this case-that the motion was weakened somewhat to satisfy certain factions within the Australian Labor Party. We would like to see the motion strengthened and the emphasis returned to sanctions and the application of those sanctions for a longer period. Page 2 of the document circulated to honourable senators explains the changes which we seek to make. It is, as it were, an explanatory memorandum. At the end of the first paragraph we seek to add the words `by means of sanctions and diplomacy'. Therefore, the paragraph would read:</PARA>
<PARA>. reaffirms its support for an on-going role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the safe-determination of nations and in particular the Resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait by means of sanctions and diplomacy. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe that is the appropriate way to go until those options have clearly been shown not to work. We believe that all the indications are that they would work. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second paragraph, which is split into two, we want to pick up another United Nations resolution-that is, we want to affirm our support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in resolution 661 for support in implementing comprehensive sanctions against Iraq until it leaves Kuwait. I feel that that should not receive any objection by honourable senators who have strongly endorsed Australia's support for the United Nations. The existing second paragraph would be substituted-and I guess this is the kernel of what we are saying-for the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>. condemns the Australian Government's warlike interpretation of Resolution 678 of the United Nations Security Council, and calls for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Australian warships from combat duty, which is consistent with that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>What we are saying is that, while resolution 678 allowed any means which were appropriate, that resolution did not mandate the use of force, nor did it set a time limit on the resolution. I think it was Senator Tate who pointed to the despondent nature of the Secretary General of the United Nations after his last bid at a resolution in meeting with Hussein. I suspect that his despondency was, as much as anything, not due to the failure of the immediately concluded attempts to find some reconciliation with Hussein but rather to the fact that, knowing the build-up of forces which had gone on in Saudi Arabia and the ships in the Gulf, he realised that that failure meant the imminent outbreak of war. I think that quite a different interpretation of his appearance on television can be put on that. We feel it is quite consistent with support for resolution 678 to continue with sanctions but at this stage not to continue with active warfare. </PARA>
<PARA> In the third paragraph we would like to see the words `serving with the UN-sanctioned multi-national forces' deleted because we believe there is a euphemistic terminology in that initially the forces were multinational forces and only later were sanctioned by the United Nations. It is misleading to suppose that right from the beginning they were United Nations forces or that they are under direct United Nations control. They are not. They are under the direct control of the United States on behalf of the implementation of the United Nations resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> In the next paragraph we express our full confidence in, and support for, the Australian forces. As I have outlined before, we deplore Iraq's widening of the conflict by its own provoked attack on Israel. Several people, both in this chamber and outside, when speaking on this issue have used the term `innocent civilians'. I find some difficulty with that term because, to the extent that Australia has become involved in this conflict, it is a decision of the Australian Government and it is supported by the Opposition. Both those parties have been selected by the Australian people to make these sorts of decisions. So in an indirect sense the Australian people, individually and collectively, are responsible for the decisions of this Government. In the same way the citizens of Iraq, individually and collectively, are responsible for the actions of their leader in that they are not overthrowing their leader. It is also relevant to point out that many private citizens, particularly in industrialised countries, have been the ones who have provided the wherewithal for Iraq's military machine. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final paragraph we want to include the words `non-military' after `the need to intensify'. Again, that stresses the need for sanctions rather than military intervention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;War was declared by Iraq on 2 August-5 1/2 months ago-when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in a vicious and unprovoked attack, an attack that included the gravest violations of human rights, including rape, torture and executions. It has been the most brutal of occupations-Arab against Arab; very similar indeed to the early Hitler regime of German against German, when there was rape, torture and executions of the German Jews. Being one of the few senators in this place who lived as an adult through most of World War II, I am only too aware of the horrors of the full-blown world war. It is because of this experience that, perhaps more than most, I am totally and utterly opposed to another world war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The world has experienced two world wars. Following World War I, the nations of the world grappled with trying to set up a policing system to make sure such world wars would not occur again-to stop any future conflict. And so was born the League of Nations. Its only power was one of moral pressure. Of course, as history tells us, it just did not work. So the League of Nations died a natural death. </PARA>
<PARA> When Hitler came to power, Britain was the leader of the democratic countries and had disarmed to an alarming extent, mainly through the Washington Treaty and later through other disarmament treaties and agreements. Because she was so unprepared, appeasement was tried. Mr Chamberlain, the Prime Minister of Britain at the time, tried to negotiate with Hitler, but precious time was lost. Finally, when war was declared, Hitler's armaments were so strong and the allies so weak it took five years and hundreds and thousands of lives before peace was restored. </PARA>
<PARA> Following World War II, once again the nations of the world grappled to set in order another policing system, again to stop any further world war. It had been the most horrific of world wars. With that determination the United Nations was born. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my dream at the time, and that of the majority of peace loving people of the world, that there never again would be a world war; that the whole of the world could get together, stand behind the United Nations, face any aggressor and say, `Withdraw'. If that aggressor refused to withdraw, then the united nations of the world could force that withdrawal. A few years ago I did not believe that that dream would have been possible in my life time. I was not alone. The majority of people at that time thought it was virtually impossible that there would be a Mr Gorbachev, that the Berlin Wall would come down, that Germany could possibly unite. I could not really imagine that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Great Britain and the United States of America could possibly sit together, negotiate on the same side, and when those negotiations fell through, vote together for the good of the world. Yet this has all happened in such a short time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never felt so euphoric as when the Berlin Wall came down brick by brick, and when, on 29 November, the United Nations Security Council resolution 678 was voted on to give Baghdad `one final opportunity' until 15 January to comply with all previous resolutions. After that date nations allied with Kuwait were authorised `to use all necessary means' to force Iraq to withdraw and honour the resolutions. It was a phrase that all members agreed would permit a military strike. </PARA>
<PARA> This has fulfilled my dream that the world would face an aggressor, united; that the world could say to that aggressor, `Withdraw'; and when that nation refused to withdraw then the world could say, `We will force a withdrawal'. Whilst it is so appalling and so sad that Saddam Hussein has refused to withdraw, has treated the world with such contempt and has ignored the United Nations and all the world appeals, it is yet a momentous occasion because it is a new world order. I find it disappointing that those members of the peace movement-and I believe the majority had dreams exactly the same as my own-are not seeing this wonderful dream being fulfilled. I wonder if they realise that the very same peace movement expressed the same sentiments as Great Britain declared war against Hitler? Do they really mean that we should not have tried to stop Hitler massacring those hundreds of thousands of Jews in the gas chambers? Do they really mean we should not stop the butcher of Baghdad murdering and plundering the people of Kuwait?</PARA>
<PARA> It has been asked on many occasions: where were they when Saddam Hussein was killing the mothers and babies of Kuwait? Were they outside the Iraqi Embassy? There were no marches then. Where were the dreams of the peace movement, the dreams for world peace? At the moment we have three ships with our brave sailors serving in the Gulf, and we in the Opposition, to quote Dr Hewson, pledge our strongest support to them. Dr Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA> They are acting in the highest traditions of our Services. They deserve the support of all Australians and we deeply hope that they will return safely to their families as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the peace movement joins me in this pledge of support. Australia must play its part. We cannot say we are too far away. If we believe in world peace, then we have to send the troops that we have been asked to send, and we have complied with that request. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 100 nations have called for the withdrawal of Saddam Hussein. Thirty-four nations supported the Security Council resolution, and 28 nations have committed forces in support of the Security Council resolution. Nine of those nations are Arab countries including Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Other countries such as many of the Asian countries, including Japan, are supplying finance. Australia is one of the 28 countries committing forces. It has supported the resolution commensurate with our size and importance as a member of the Security Council, and it is important that we send a message to Saddam Hussein from the whole of this Parliament that we support our troops. In their tremendously difficult job this is the very least we can do. We cannot send a message that undermines our Navy. There should be no honourable senator or honourable member in this Parliament who acts as a pawn for Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> How would our service personnel react to some of the speeches made in this place undermining them? I wonder how their wives and mothers feel when listening to the debate by the Democrats? If I were one of them I would be so angry. I would be very cross. I could imagine no one being so disloyal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion on the Gulf crisis moved by Senator Button on behalf of the Government this afternoon. It is a comprehensive and carefully constructed motion which, in my view and, I believe, in the view of the vast majority of senators, is utterly appropriate in these circumstances of crisis-a crisis which jeopardises international peace and security. It emerged from the ranks of the Labor Government after an exhaustive process of consultation, but it is very pleasing to note the degree of support that has emerged for the proposition from the Opposition parties. That demonstrates a practical application of bipartisanship on this very difficult issue and, in my view, there should be greater bipartisanship on issues of foreign affairs and defence policy. Certainly I would also like to associate my name with those words of support which have come from both sides of the chamber for the men and women of our naval force in the Gulf and the related medical teams.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My first speech in the Senate was on the Gulf crisis-on the crisis that stemmed from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. The first observations that I made in the chamber on the issue remain valid today. Certainly, the observations that were made at that time-not only by me but also by other senators who participated in that debate-concerning the regime of Saddam Hussein are especially appropriate in the light of the circumstances that have developed since. </PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives in the United States of America on 12 January this year, Congressman Stephen Solarz said:</PARA>
<PARA> The great lesson of our time is that evil still exists, and when evil is on the march, it must be confronted. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Persian Gulf, almost half a year after the brutal and unprovoked annexation of Kuwait, the time for patience has ended and the time for firmness has arrived. Saddam Hussein represents a clear and present danger, not only to the region, but to the world. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very clear assessment of the threat existing in the Middle East and beyond, caused by the aggression of the Hussein regime in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Many historical analogies have been drawn with the circumstances of the present crisis. Many have been drawn accurately in the debate this afternoon and this evening. It is true that the world stood by when the Japanese military invaded, occupied and then annexed Manchuria in 1931. It is true that the world stood by when Nazi Germany marched into the Rhineland, when fascist Italy invaded Abyssinia, and when Hitler annexed Austria in the Anschluss of 1938 and then absorbed Czechoslovakia into the Third Reich. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are also other analogies that are appropriate in the circumstances and ought to be drawn. For it is also true that, in the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939, the fascists for the very first time crushed a working democracy by force of arms. A lesson was very clear that the democracies in Britain, France and the United States (US) could be relied upon to stand by if sufficient force was shown early on. That led directly to the Second World War. It is also particularly appropriate to look at the circumstances of the Baltic states tonight, given that they were absorbed by force of arms into the Soviet Union in 1940. Again, the lessons of history can be drawn by analogy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a brief observation or two about the position outlined by the Australian Democrats in the chamber today. I hope that I am not doing the Democrats a disservice when I say that as I listened to the contributions I found their position both uncertain and contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument is for sanctions to be applied-indeed, for sanctions to be given longer to work-but there is no provision for enforcement of the sanctions. At the same time, if we listen to the contributions made by some of the Democrats spokesmen, there is to be no Australian naval presence in the Gulf. Indeed, there is even a question about the presence of a multinational force to apply the sanctions. The Democrats argue-and I have no doubt that they are being utterly sincere-that they are opposed to Saddam Hussein and opposed to the annexation of Kuwait, but how is the international community supposed to demonstrate that opposition? With what resources? With what application? What practical steps can be taken in that circumstance?</PARA>
<PARA> Reluctant as we might be to reach the conclusion, United Nations (UN) resolution 678 is the only step left open to the world community. Not only had the process of negotiation under the auspices of the United Nations been exhausted but also the initiatives of the Soviet Union had come to an end-to nought. The French initiative had come to an end-to nought. A total of six United Nations resolutions had been defied by the Iraqi authorities. World opinion was being defied. Saddam clearly was not going to withdraw from Kuwait. The sanctions were not working. There is no doubt about that at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I again quote Congressman Solarz from the United States House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> Judge Webster, the head of the CIA, does not believe the sanctions will be sufficient to get Iraq out of Kuwait. Nor do the British, nor the French, nor the Egyptians, nor the Saudis. Not one of our coalition partners believes that sanctions will be sufficient to get Iraq out of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>When one looks at the circumstances of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait-at the widespread looting-it becomes clear in part why the sanctions could not work, because the looting was directed specifically at replacing some of the resources that had been locked out of Iraq by the quarantine. We should also make mention of the fact that because of the quarantine certain of the poorer states in the Third World were hurting grievously from the increase in oil prices. More directly, and perhaps more significantly as we debate the issue here in the chamber tonight, the Iraqi regime used the time in which the sanctions were in force to strengthen its position militarily in Kuwait itself and on the Saudi-Iraqi border. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a practical conclusion to draw that the coalition would not hold indefinitely. It had held remarkably well today and holds well tonight as we deliberate, but it would not have held indefinitely. So eventually an ultimatum was given to Saddam Hussein, followed by appeals to withdraw unconditionally. These appeals were rejected. It is a reasonable conclusion to draw that Saddam Hussein for a very long time had determined on a course of conflict and war. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to make a few observations about the peace movement in this country. I certainly acknowledge people's right to put a position, to articulate a case and to argue that case. But the position is confused and confusing. The very easy slogans of `no blood for oil' and `bring the ships home' are no substitute for reasoned policy; no substitute for a policy which will restore the circumstance in Kuwait; and no substitute for a policy that will end the pillage, murder and rape in Kuwait. Some in the peace movement argue for sanctions, some argue for negotiations and some argue for appeasement. It is the great virtue of our democracy that we can sit here and see what happened today in terms of people putting a point of view. But it could not occur in Kuwait tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to say a few words about the Iraqi regime itself. There are some lessons for the West in terms of the kinds of people with whom we deal from time to time in international affairs. The Iraqi regime is one of singular brutality. In most circumstances, the maximum brutality is applied to reach a political conclusion. The Iraqi regime runs an economy that is based on a need for continuing conflict. Its political structure reflects its militarism and its aggression and the desire of its President for aggrandisement. This can be seen in the treatment of the Kurdish population. The only acknowledgment Saddam Hussein has ever given his Kurdish minority is to target them with his dreadful weapons. It is seen in the warfare conducted for nearly a decade against Iran, in terms of attacks upon centres of civilian population and the use of horrifying weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons-weapons not seen since they were outlawed after the First World War. </PARA>
<PARA> It is seen in the absolutely bloody and unjustified invasion and occupation of Kuwait, well documented now by Amnesty International in terms of the suffering inflicted upon the civilian population. It is seen in the unprovoked attack upon the state of Israel, again with weapons directed at population centres rather than military targets. </PARA>
<PARA> In a very disturbing turn, in the last 24 hours it is seen in the Iraqi treatment of prisoners of war in direct violation of the Geneva Convention and all the norms of human behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> We should learn a little more about politics from our mistakes. The West should learn from our experience with Saddam Hussein. Not so long ago his army was seen as a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism being directed against the Gulf states. We should learn from our errors and mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to look briefly at the international reaction. This has been well covered, so I will not dwell upon it. If one excepts Iraq, all but four member states of the United Nations-those four being Jordan, Cuba, Yemen and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; a misnomer if ever there was one-have voted for the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. They have brought the moral pressure inherent in their commitment to the United Nations to bear on an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. It has been said many times that 28 countries are now militarily involved. Most of the democracies are actively engaged. </PARA>
<PARA> To look within the ranks of the Socialist International-the umbrella association with which the Australian Labor Party is associated-to quote Neil Kinnock: the British Labour Party voted unequivocally in the House of Commons for the United Nations. When the UN intervention began, the Spanish Socialists said again, unequivocally, that responsibility for the war rested with Saddam Hussein. To quote the leader of the Italian Socialists, as Senator Tate and Senator McMullan did earlier in the debate, Bettino Craxi, in the Italian House of Deputies, just a few days ago, on 16 January, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have seen many dictatorial regimes throw themselves into military adventures in the conviction or the illusion of victory. But never before have we witnessed a regime issuing a challenge of war, knowing full well that it will lose. All this has coloured the conduct of the Iraqi regime with such irrationality and fanaticism, that it is beyond our horizon, removed from the principles in which we believe, from our desire to see every contest be the subject of dialogue and negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Craxi concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> It is removed from the peaceful and pacifist spirit of our tradition, the tradition of men and women of peace. </PARA>
<PARA>I doubt that anyone can put a response in more eloquent terms than did Mr Craxi on that occasion in the House of Deputies in Rome. </PARA>
<PARA> This war is not being fought to make the world safe for democracy-no-one can claim that. It is certainly not being fought to make the world safe for feudalism in the Gulf. It is not being fought to restore the al-Sabah family in Kuwait in simple terms or in exclusive terms. But it is being fought in defence of the great principles inherent in the United Nations charter, including the principle of collective security. This Parliament was one of the first to support and endorse these principles. It was bipartisan in that endorsement. A great Australian Foreign Minister led the way and broke the ground. Of course, I am referring to Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, first President of the UN General Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations really is the last great hope for humanity. I will quote what the British Prime Minister Clem Attlee said in the House of Commons on 5 July 1950-the only other occasion in which the United Nations had been obliged to intervene militarily. This puts matters tonight in context. Of the outbreak of the Korean war and of Britain's decision, sponsored by the Labour Government and supported by the conservative opposition to intervene, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The issue before the House this afternoon is a simple one, although it involves very grave issues of peace and war. I am asking the House to support the Government in the action which they have taken in resisting aggression. That action is fulfilling our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Attlee continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If the United Nations is not to go the way of the League of Nations, the members must be prepared to act when the need arises. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Attlee's words have a certain resonance about them this evening, just as they did that afternoon in London on 5 July 1950 when the world was confronted by the outbreak of the Korean war, again an act of naked aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> This war is being fought to make the world a little safer for humanity in the longer term. A new international order is gradually emerging-hopefully one that is based on greater economic and political justice; hopefully one that is based on the great documents of the United Nations, particularly the Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a few observations about the international media in this war. This is the first war of satellites in more than one sense. It is certainly the first war of the networks. It is very important to a democracy such as ours that we spend a little time looking at the way in which the media is obliged to report the conflict and goes about reporting the conflict. There is a myth abroad about the Vietnam war, particularly in the United States, and that is that television lost the war for the Americans. I know that that has been popularised with expressions such as, `If network television had been at the battle of Gettysburg, there would be two Americas today'. But it is a myth and a fraudulent assumption. </PARA>
<PARA> The only documented analysis of the coverage, not only of the American media but also of the international media of the war in Vietnam, was actually put together by the United States Army Centre for Military History; an author by the name of William Hammond compiled a 414-page study into the media's treatment of the war in Vietnam, particularly the American military presence. Mr Hammond left no-one in doubt as to his conclusions. He concluded that it was the lack of credibility on the part of the Administration, particularly the Johnson Administration, and the rising US casualty rate which supposedly caused American public opinion to sour. It is not the case that American television `lost' the war for the United States. It was a consequence of the low credibility and the damage being done to the American forces. </PARA>
<PARA> An assessment of that report means that, if anything, there is a greater obligation upon the Administration in Washington, upon governments generally and the media present to report the conflict than was previously believed. To date the media reporting has been, judging by our un- tutored but hopefully critical assessment, sound in the sense of evaluation and analysis. There are very great responsibilities upon the people charged with the reporting of the war in the Middle East. It is not without reason that Saddam Hussein has retained the Cable News Network in Baghdad. The Hussein regime sees the advantage of having network television present. We should be alert to the need to be careful in our analysis and not to leap to conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the post-war world which will emerge-hopefully sooner rather than later-we need to address the vexed problems inherent in the circumstances of the West Bank and the Gaza. Those circumstances are the result of wars not only in 1967 and in 1973 but also of the Jordanian Army's quite brutal suppression of the Palestinians in 1970 and of the war in Lebanon, fought from 1982 onwards. We need to address the problems of the Kurdish people who have been dispossessed, massacred and harassed by their Iraqi overlords. We need to make certain of the security of the state of Israel. That has become absolutely critical given the unprovoked missile assaults upon that country. </PARA>
<PARA> A new world order is emerging and addressing the problems of the Middle East will be an important first step. We should also look to the emergence of a genuine north-south dialogue-a dialogue which can begin a reality based on a more equitable distribution of both wealth and power so that peace and security can be more than just words. We can make the world a little less safer for despots and ultimately make it unsafe for aggressors. </PARA>
<PARA> When this war is over, there will be lessons to be learnt and other wars can be avoided. As we support UN Resolution 678 tonight, so in the Middle East we should reaffirm our support for resolutions 242 and 338 in terms of settlement affecting Israel and the Palestinians. This Government is committed to the support of an international conference on the Middle East, although not to linkage with the circumstances of the invasion of Kuwait. We can look to justice for people currently living under the Iraqi regime whose only crime is to call themselves Kurds; we can acknowledge their rights. </PARA>
<PARA> To finish I will quote again from Clem Attlee's speech of July 1950:</PARA>
<PARA> The main matter that concerns all of us is the preservation of peace. I have no doubt at all that this matter has to be carried through and settled, to show that aggression does not pay. I hope that it will be realised by all the people in all the free countries that to preserve peace the rule of law must be upheld and that we are in this, and that we cannot leave it to someone else to do. </PARA>
<PARA>It concerns us all. We have pledged ourselves to the support of the United Nations; we have taken action with others. Mr Attlee concluded with these words, and they are appropriate tonight:</PARA>
<PARA> I confidently ask the House and the country for their unanimous support. </PARA>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="76" SPEAKER="Kernot Sen C." NAMEID="XW4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.05)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am one of those who believe there is no such thing as either a just war or a justifiable war. Events of the past few days have served only to reinforce my view that all wars are intrinsically wrong, that violence begets violence and that this endorsement of violence as a legitimate means of conflict resolution from us, the law-makers of our society, will filter down and permeate our entire society. I believe we have an obligation to demonstrate that other options can work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course the actions of Saddam Hussein and the troops acting in his name are indefensible and no Australian Democrats are defending him or them, but to say that supporting and demonstrating for peace is equivalent to support for Hussein is just plain dishonest. In the same way, involvement in peace demonstrations does not mean that we are condemning or betraying the Australian naval forces currently in the Gulf. We share the very grave concern expressed here for their safety and our prayers go to all of them and to their families. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in choosing the option for war in the Gulf, I believe the United States and its allies, including Australia, are ignoring the fundamental lesson of history: that war solves nothing and only creates more problems. We have only to look at the so-called peace settlement of World War I to see that; we know that it was a direct cause of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> Some things have changed and I think it is encouraging to note that since the Second World War many people throughout the world have learnt the lessons of history. I would like to quote from an article in today's Australian Financial Review entitled, `Anti-war sentiments gather strength', which states:</PARA>
<PARA> News of the Gulf war has been greeted with widespread public opposition in Europe, the US and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In Europe the opposition has been strongest in Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . with 80 per cent of the population opposing military action in the Middle East. The streets of Germany's major cities have erupted in daily mass peace rallies since the allied bombing of Iraq began last week.</PARA>
<PARA> In France . . . nearly 60 per cent . . . said they opposed any military action. </PARA>
<PARA> About 55 per cent of Italians said they did not agree with their country's involvement in the Gulf, in particular after the Pope pronounced that no war could be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> While about 63 per cent of Spaniards thought President Saddam Hussein was to blame, about the same number thought that war should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> About 65 per cent of Belgiums backed their Government's decision not to participate in the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of apartment blocks across Germany now have white sheets waving from the windows, signifying peace. </PARA>
<PARA> An older generation, not only in Germany but in other parts of Europe, remembers the experience, the humiliation and the destruction of war. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the real cost of war compared with the cost of prolonged peace initiatives has been glossed over in this debate. We are asked how much will it cost and who will pay the bill if we are to leave ships enforcing sanctions for 18 months. That question symbolises to me the inability of most people here to recognise the real long term and intangible costs of war which balance sheets do not accommodate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the cost of the human impact of the attack on Kuwait. How does one measure the long term cost of human suffering and trauma? Suffering does not end when a ceasefire is achieved or when a military budget runs out. The second cost of the Gulf war is the major long term repercussions for international relations in the Middle East. Assuming the United States wins, what will be the aftermath? Will the people of the Middle East accept the new order and live comfortably with Western domination of their political life? Of course not. Virtually all the present problems of the Middle East date back to World War I and the determination of what was then still imperial Britain to shape a strategic region in its own interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Emotionally devastated by the vast casualty lists generated on the killing grounds of France, I think it is fair to say that the British public had little interest in Middle East affairs at that time. Perhaps we are again to see a carve up of the Middle East as an outcome of this war. High on the agenda will be the future of Palestinians. One of the important issues on the agenda of those seeking a peace conference on all of the festering problems of the Middle East will be achieved and could have been achieved before imposing a deadline if there had been a genuine willingness to pursue the option of extensive and prolonged negotiations and discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that this was a European initiative, we said, `No, this may allow Saddam Hussein to save face'. Preventing him from saving face was so much more important than saving hundreds of thousands of innocent lives. In refusing this option, we are reinforcing 70-year-old secret deals and shabby political manoeuvrings which laid the foundations for the present Middle East agony and, I would contend, the roots for further war will flourish. </PARA>
<PARA> The third long term cost relates to the precedent that war against Iraq sets for the post-Cold War international order, something we have heard a great deal about so far in this debate. Does this mean that military action should be taken against all big countries which are attempting to subjugate smaller ones? For example, are Tibet and Lithuania to be liberated by massive forces and will we take part?</PARA>
<PARA> Social justice costs also have to be counted. To date our deployment of frigates has cost $300,000 a day or $100m per year. Just 12 days costs amounting to $3.6m would completely fund the request of the United Nations Children's Fund for emergency assistance to the refugees in Jordan. In this financial year, the United States will spend $30 billion mounting its offensive against Iraq. The total of world aid by comparison is $50 billion. I ask: Where is the morality in these priorities?</PARA>
<PARA> Then there are the environmental costs, some of which Senator Coulter has already referred to. Red Adair, as reported in a recent British Broadcasting Corporation program, maintains that it would be impossible to deal with the fire situation if Iraq sets off the charges attached to the Iraqi oil wells. This environmental cataclysm could just as easily be ignited by aerial bombardment from the West. The fires would raise the temperature in surrounding countries to 60 or even 65 degrees centigrade. Such an environment would be unlivable. India's entire grain crop, for instance, would be affected. Where do the conventional ledger books take account of these costs? The answer is that they do not. What, too, of the cost of a breakdown in this Government's policy of multiculturalism-a policy so carefully built up by the community with goodwill and understanding over many years, a policy seriously threatened by the present upsurge in anti-Arab racism. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Loosley, I would like to refer to the role of the media because it is one of the significant and distinguishing features of this conflict and the build-up to it. It has involved the use of the most sophisticated of this century's communications technology. Personally, I have found it sickening, and I know that many Australians have as well, to hear from nearly all Australian television stations, `You are now watching the Gulf war live on channel x', and to see it interspersed with advertisements for cars and fast foods. I believe that it is dangerous to a democracy when the majority of the media wants war because they believe that it makes good media, the sort of good media which reduces warfare and the killing of unknown and unpredictable numbers of human beings to the same format as a gridiron game where a cold analysis of each manoeuvre is followed by replays to make sure that we are sufficiently desensitised. How encouraging it is then to read that a huge number of viewers are now turning off prime time war coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the media must not be underestimated. I want to praise the reporters and camera operators who have made a conscious effort to canvass all viewpoints. Equally, I want to roundly condemn those who deliberately choose to deal in stereotypes, concentrating on the stereotypical, colourfully visual demonstrator, for example, without showing the broad cross-section of people who have been attending peace demonstrations throughout this country. These attempts to sensationalise, trivialise and marginalise peace demonstrations are dishonest and undemocratic. </PARA>
<PARA> John Pilger in the Guardian Weekly last week suggests that in the present conflict the media will bear much of the responsibility for a patriotic and culpable silence and that it will not play the role it played during the Vietnam War. He advances two reasons for this: firstly, that there has been the communications revolution in recent years and, secondly, because in this war the United States might actually win. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly reject the assertion that five months was a sufficient trial time for sanctions to be demonstrated as working. We have heard from other speakers that international experts accept that sanctions succeed when they affect 25 to 35 per cent of the target nation's trade. We know that this has been achieved in Iraq. The importance of these sanctions has been canvassed by previous Democrat speakers. I support and endorse their comments. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not just liberating Kuwait, we are leaving a legacy of violence that will endure for decades-not, as Senator Loosley said, a world certain to be safer for humanity in the longer term. I call for a cessation of hostilities and a new peace initiative. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Northern Territory)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.17)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion we are dealing with today relating to the Gulf war is basically in five parts: firstly, the threat to world peace by the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq; secondly, the support for United Nations initiatives; thirdly, confidence and support for our involved service personnel and the involvement of our allies; fourthly, concern about the Iraqi attacks on Israel; and, fifthly, the long term resolution of security issues in the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I look at this problem from the perspective of the Northern Territory electorate which has previously been involved in war. Forcibly this is brought home by the historical account in the book entitled Australia's Pearl Harbour by Douglas Lockwood. The author's note to that book states:</PARA>
<PARA> Eight ships were sunk and others beached and burnt. Two hundred and forty three people were killed in less than one hour and more than three hundred wounded. Much of the town was destroyed and commercial life ceased at once. The banks were closed by government decree and the centre of N.T. Administration shortly removed to Alice Springs. Thereafter, although martial law was never proclaimed, Darwin was a town under military control. There were more than fifty subsequent attacks upon it by the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> The death toll on that first day made it the worst disaster in history on Australian soil. In spite of that, comparatively little is known of what happened. Two or three writers have discussed it only briefly. The Official War History, in each of several volumes, gives the barest outline. </PARA>
<PARA>How very different to the situation which we are now considering. Two and a half years before the bombing of Darwin, the then wartime member of the House of Representatives for Northern Territory, Adair Macalister Blain, had made a very prophetic speech in Parliament on 6 September 1939 about the early stages of the war in Europe. In talking about the Northern Territory, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>My electorate includes people of all classes. I have bushmen and workers, civil servants and businessmen, military and naval officers and men, and people of every other class in my electorate. I know that whatever may be their differences on local issues-and we all have our differences-my constituents will stand firmly behind the Government. They are all good Australians. They are the flower of this country, and they are prepared to fight for it.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is just as true today. Further on in the same speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Although I cannot cry, as Hitler did in the Reichstag, ``Heil Victory'', I can and do cry, ``Hail Justice''-justice for the frightened millions of Europe who live under the fear of this bully of Berlin who is determined to win his objectives even over the corpses of women and children. We are fighting for justice. </PARA>
<PARA>The comparisons in these quotes with today and today's issues are more than interesting. I am reminded of the quote by Santayana:</PARA>
<PARA>Those who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it. </PARA>
<PARA>The comparisons between Hitler, the bully boy of Berlin, and the butcher of Baghdad, Saddam Hussein, are very valid to this debate. We need to state over and again if necessary that it is Saddam Hussein's aggression, terror and blackmail that have caused the present conflict with all its sad consequences and necessary forceful use of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein has flouted the international and United Nations overtures since 2 August last year. No-one wants war, but the brutality and bastardry of Iraq have left the civilised and thinking nations with no alternatives. Senator Tate's speech put many of the human rights issues and more personal theological points into an excellent perspective. It is necessary at this time that all parliamentarians and in fact all citizens of Australia need to stand behind service personnel and their families more than ever before. We must not abandon the much needed support for service personnel serving in Australia and the Middle East. Now, more than ever, we need to reaffirm our commitment to the thousands of service personnel living and working in the Northern Territory, particularly those in logistic and strategic support and at Pine Gap. We cannot let those people down. </PARA>
<PARA> Freedom and the high tech-revolution are inextricably connected. In both the military operation and the media presentation of the Gulf war, we have come to realise just how complex this war is in areas of technology. But there is also a deeper consideration. I quote from American author, George Gilder. In an article in November 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Today, America is the world leader in technological innovation not because of its government or its Pentagon funding or its accumulated wealth or its natural resources or its continental scope-or any of the blessings to which U.S. success is often ascribed in text books-but because of an older ethic of freedom and sacrifice. In short, America's triumphs spring from the very moral codes and disciplines, the religious commitment and faith . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The media coverage, of course, heightens our impressions, perceptions and delusions of the Gulf war. In the early stages, it was easy to get drawn into the war games scenario in which the euphoria almost created the view that Star Wars' Luke Sky Walker and Darth Vader were with us. It is certainly a war of good and evil. But we do have to put it back into a real and human context and not rely on our initial, surrealistic impressions. We must pay credit to the skill and the commitment of the United States, Britain, France, the Arab coalition and all of the 28 participating countries. </PARA>
<PARA> This was illustrated just a short while ago when the Australian Democrats as usual were wrong. Belgium is involved. It has four ships committed and its Government has just recently reinstated its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, a further commitment of which has been given in recent days to support Turkey. The Democrats have a throwaway line in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also stop for a moment and pay credit to the crucial role of the United Nations. The United Nations has played a role through much of the history of recent years as a peacemaker, a conciliator, and we certainly saw the SecretaryGeneral try the last minute stops to avoid this catastrophe. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no guarantee that this will be a short war. It could well drag on for weeks and months. As the action moves to a battle on the ground the tactics, problems and frustrations will compound. This will be the time to stand forcibly behind our objectives and our field troops. We must acknowledge that Pine Gap and Nurrungar do play an important role and are a measure of our international obligations. Organisations such as the Red Cross and the international medical teams will need to know that we reinforce their roles and work with thanks, appreciation and support. We do not need the trendies and the treacherous demonstrators undermining their dangerous and necessary tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> By all means pray for peace. What a wonderful dream. We are all doing that. I have Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, for example, at Galiwinku in Arnhem Land, which have made similar expressions to so many other communities throughout Australia. I had discussions last week with the acting imam of the muslim mosque in Darwin and with other religious leaders with regard to the situation at the time. But, as Senator Newman said earlier, our prayers must be equally with our service personnel and, most importantly, their families and the support they need in this community; our people working in medical, political and diplomatic fields of service; and our Middle East migrants-particularly those suffering community misunderstandings or tensions.</PARA>
<PARA> Today in this chamber and in the House of Representatives we saw and heard demonstrators from a group called Students United Against War. I understand that Senator Vallentine also publicly yelled her frustrations from a privileged position reserved for senators in the House of Representatives. I can only describe their organised angry activities as naive and misguided. It is a pity that the education, social and economic conditions and results of the last few years have produced this sort of unacceptable behaviour. Certainly, Senator Vallentine and the students have every right to state their views, however naive and misguided. But there are proper forums and certainly a sympathetic media to expound their opinions. If there is validity and balance in what they say, then those points will register with the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an insult to the intelligence of Australians to presume that the community is not listening to or dealing with the complexity of the moral, military, political, economic, religious or social issues. I read the yellow flier that was sent to us like a kindergarten kite from the gallery. When I looked through that particular pamphlet I noticed the sort of catch words about how the Students United Against War is a loose network of students committed to ending the conflict in the Gulf. They condemn the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq but they say, and I heighten, that they:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . believe that war will not resolve any of the underlying problems which gave rise to the invasion. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph speaks of a commitment to bring the warships home and achieve a cease-fire. They condemn racism and then acknowledge that this has been generated by cultural ignorance and prejudice. Again there is a catchcry. They want:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a more comprehensive solution to the problems of the Middle East through an international peace conference . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This would concentrate, of course, on issues such as self-determination. The paucity of the arguments in that pamphlet only convinced me that the views of this vocal, noisy minority were, as I said earlier, naive and misguided. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I express concern at the activities of the Labor member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon. Mr Snowdon holds office as Parliamentary Secretary and a member of the Executive Council. Obviously, he has trouble reconciling his roles as a member of the Hawke Labor Government and his past, which is steeped in radical peace activism and entrenched in the Marxist-Leninist roots of the socialist Left. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very obviously, Mr Snowdon is out of step with the Government and he has abdicated his responsibility in speaking for the majority of his electorate-the same one I represent, the Northern Territory. Mr Snowdon has acted as sponsor for a street peace rally under the banner `War is not the answer', after-I stress, after-the commencement of military activities. His office has also acted as the conduit for fax material by the Alice Springs Peace Group against Pine Gap, located in his own electorate and manned by hundreds of his own and my constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What a marked difference there is between the positions of Mr Snowdon and Senator Tate. Mr Snowdon has no alternative but to join Senator Vallentine's pacifist alliance and get out of his official positions. He cannot be a wolf in sheep's clothing. If the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does not call the tune and set proper examples for his own team, then not only does he weaken his own leadership but also he compromises the position of his rhetoric and the official Government position. I ask the Prime Minister to apply the same standards to Mr Snowdon as to the protesters he accused of mouthing mindless slogans and falling into the trap of appeasement. </PARA>
<PARA> I earlier quoted Adair Blain, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Northern Territory. On 29 November 1939-remember, this is 1939-he also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Labour party has nothing to be proud of in acting in the way it is doing. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) talked today about the horrors of war tears rolled down his cheeks like pebbles and scoria sliding down the slopes of a mountain. Sentiment will have no effect on the German people other than to convince them that Australia, from the defence point of view, is a huge joke. It will also keep the neutrals wondering how we stand. There must be an end to the Labour Party's policy of compartmentalism. </PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA> When I go back to the Northern Territory, no doubt, two or three people will ask me, `Why do you speak on matters that do not directly concern the Territory?' I shall answer them that I was elected to this Parliament as a representative, not as a delegate. Apparently, however, members of the Labour Party regard themselves as delegates. Perhaps they would wish this House to be described as the House of Delegates. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder if that quote could not be applied equally to the factionalism within the Labor Party today. The motion before the Senate is a strong statement by the major parties and reflects the majority view of the Australian community. The debate also highlights the total irrelevancy of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of this serious issue stands on its merits and the high principles of Australia, the United States, Britain, France, the Arab coalition partners and the United Nations. We will not be subdued by the arrogance of the dictator Saddam Hussein, his Baath Socialist Party, terrorism or tyranny in whatever form it takes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I contribute to this debate in part as one who has lived first hand through the horrors of war, not as a soldier but as a 12-year-old bit of flotsam who for some three months was part of the 1945 refugee trek between the retreating German and advancing Russian armies. Compared with today's sophisticated remote control weaponry, the planes and tanks which shot up the refugee columns were primitive, yet probably on a dollar for dollar basis at least as efficient in producing burnt human flesh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later in life, I determined that I would attempt to contribute to the elimination of institutional violence in all its forms. It is a determination which was lent additional urgency by the total horror of the Holocaust. Let us not make a mistake: once we accept institutional killing as a valid instrument of national policy, the difference is one of degree only. In today's world, there will be cases where to kill will prevent a greater loss of life, and this statement will indicate to honourable senators that I have been unable to achieve the position of an uncompromising pacifist. In many ways, I wish I could have done so. I suspect that it would make me a better person. Certainly, life would be much less complicated. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is, I believe that as a world community we have some way to go before we become a humane and more civilised community. It is a slow and difficult path that nations and their leaders have to tread, a path that demands moral commitment, intellectual rigour and independence, and determination to use economic resources to change the hearts and minds of this and future generations. It is a matter of great regret and indeed sadness that Australia's political establishment-as represented by the Government and the Opposition-could not meet this challenge on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a violent aggressor with the blood of millions on his hands, and that he must be stopped. However, the key to the divergence of thinking between the Australian Democrats and the old parties are two phrases the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) repeated this afternoon: `Only as a last resort' and `Should that become necessary'. Both statements open the way to build on the unique consensus of United Nations member states to impose and enforce sanctions. It was a tangible acknowledgment that we had left behind the Cold War with its nuclear threat and that we might be moving towards a new world order-a term used in somewhat different senses by other people today-an age when conflicts are resolved and aggressors stopped by essentially non-violent means. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now lost the chance to move this world towards a more civilised and humane community. We have lost it through the utter lack of true leadership displayed by what professes to be the leading government of the Western world, that of the United States of America, and by our own Government and our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who could not rush fast enough into embracing the means of mass destruction as the simplistic Rambo solution to the challenges facing us in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons put forward for this utter failure of leadership are spurious. They say that we cannot have appeasement, and Hitler is invoked in a dishonest sleight of hand. However, there was no attempt to contain Hitler prior to 1939 except by talking, no determination to apply sanctions, and no capacity to do so: there was no choice but to go to war ultimately. By contrast, it is clear that resolution 678 is permissive and not mandatory. It does offer alternatives, yet the United States, and to our shame, Australia, have chosen to use the most violent option, an option which, in Philip Adams's words in the Australian last weekend, `will burn children alive'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an option which was chosen despite the mounting evidence that sanctions are working. After only five months, no-one other than the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reports that exports have been contained to 97 per cent, that imports have been contained to 90 per cent, and that there has been a 40 per cent drop in production in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also illogical in economic terms. The cost of keeping a determined United Nations force, which we would have to have in place if we continued to rely on sanctions as we should, is but a fraction of what it costs the United States and the world as a whole to run this particular war. Day one of Operation Desert Storm was estimated to have cost the United States in excess of $US500m-in our terms $A645m. This cost is purely ammunition and equipment. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost to the United States alone could vary between $A36 billion and $A111 billion, depending on the length and intensity of the conflict. It is horrific in terms of human lives and it is catastrophic in terms of throwing the world back to the Dark Ages. </PARA>
<PARA> If any proof were needed for the bankruptcy of our so-called leaders, one only needs to look at the Prime Minister's mindless gibe at people asking him to think again; in fact to think. Worse than the facile arguments we have heard from the Government is the insult that Dr Hewson hurled at people who are seeking peaceful solutions. According to Dr Hewson, people who do not want to kill are wimps. Let us ask the question: who is a wimp-the person who risks his or her life, like the peace activists Robert Burrowes, Jack Lomax and Jack King, or people like John Hewson egging on others to kill or be killed in the secure knowledge that they will not be called upon to leave their safe havens well behind the front lines? Who is the wimp? Who, indeed, is the coward?</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me express gratitude for the substantial proportion of Australians opposing the military solution. No cheap shots about the shouts, the dress or the appearance of the young people in the chamber today can obscure the fact that they have the moral conviction and the determination to fashion a future which is not dependent on the destruction of human beings; a determination the old parties in this place lack. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to support the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the motion that springs from his statement. To put it another way, I would like to speak on behalf of other peace activists in this House-not the peace activists who believe that the only way to put one's point of view is to stand outside the American Embassy and shout obscenities; not the peace activists who shout down lecturers and who shout down politicians in this home of free speech; not the people who accuse anyone who has a different view from them of being warmongers; but the other type of peace activist who is not necessarily a pacifist but who believes that in human nature there is always a tendency to be aggressive and that in the conduct of nations there will from time to time be a breakdown of communications between those nations. At the end of the day there are some nations, because of their social and political structures, which are unable to accept the rule of law; which are unable to accept the sovereignty of their neighbours; which are unable to accept even the most basic forms of human decency; and which are not prepared to accept that their citizens have any entitlement to those basic forms of human decency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes, I am a peace activist like most people in the Australian Labor Party. I put my papers in as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam war because I thought that war was a mistake. I believe that anyone who opposed that war was quite correct. It was strategically a bad decision. It was humanely a bad decision. In the long term geopolitical network that has come out of Asia, and South East Asia in particular, it was a bad mistake. But that does not mean to say that because the Americans, for example, made a mistake in Vietnam-as did the French before them-and because the Americans made mistakes in Central and South America, the Americans are always wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, one thing that strikes me about American society is that, for all its faults, on the whole it is the epitome of a society which encourages and tolerates freedom of expression. In a strange way, it has brought through from its eighteenth century beginnings a concept of universal democracy which has been extremely influential in the parliaments of this world and in world forums. It occasionally lets itself down. Yet we do have so-called peace activists, who can see only wrong in what the United States does. I found it on the whole a fairly healthy society. I must say that it is a lot healthier than Romania, the Soviet Union and other peoples' democracies that I have come in contact with during my political career. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come into this Parliament to debate this particular issue, I would hope that we would talk about how we can bring peace to this world. I cannot think of anyone in this chamber that I know who specifically gets pleasure out of going to war; who believes that the impact of a Cruise missile, some antitank device or some antipersonnel weapon is fun. Nobody in this Government, and I think nobody in this Parliament, extracts pleasure from seeing Australia at war. To tell the truth, Australia is at war at the moment; albeit in a limited way according to the capacity of this country to provide rational assistance to the United Nations force. </PARA>
<PARA> The war did not begin, as so many people have said, on the seventeenth of this month. It began on 2 August last year when the Iraqi forces marched into Kuwait, having sued for peace against the Iranians-the war against whom they also began. We are not talking here about a particular country that by circumstances had been forced to defend its borders. Sometimes excuses can be made in that type of situation. We are talking about a country that, in clear breach of international understandings and law, marched into a separate sovereign country, began torturing its innocent citizens and began dismantling the infrastructure of that country almost immediately after it had gained any control over it. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter two hoots whether the ruling family in Kuwait were convinced democrats, moderate royalists or whatever. The simple fact is that they were the internationally recognised government of the independent country of Kuwait. Let us face it, for the peace activists, so-called, to find an excuse for Saddam Hussein to attack Kuwait by saying that the ruling family of Kuwait was not democratic is one of the most tenuous and I think deceitful arguments for people to parade before this Parliament. It does not excuse the Iraqi move. </PARA>
<PARA> The Middle East is not exactly brimming over with democratic countries. Even Israel, which has a parliament similar to ours in terms of its representational arrangements, still denies at least 800,000 of its Palestinian citizens-or prisoners, if one can call them that-the right to vote and to have the civil liberties that are accepted by Israeli citizens. But at least Israel is some way towards being a genuine democracy. If one looks around the rest of the Middle East, the countries are very much a product of their history. </PARA>
<PARA> To begin with, let us get rid of the argument that it was all right, it was okay, it was acceptable for Saddam Hussein to march into Kuwait because the Kuwaitis were not running a pristine democracy. That argument is no excuse for breaches of international covenants and accepted international law. It certainly in no way defends the atrocities that are being committed now and have been committed since 2 August on Kuwaiti citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that nobody in this chamber, with a few exceptions, can stand up and be proud about our record in the Middle East. We have tolerated excesses from the Israelis. We have tolerated it because the Iraqis were fighting the dreaded Ayatollah Khomeini. We tolerated excesses from the Iraqis that we would not have tolerated, I presume, at any other time. We sat on our backsides while the most enormous invasions of civil liberties and human rights occurred in both Iran and Iraq. I do not say everyone in this Parliament, but on the whole we were pretty quiet. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the peace activists who have been standing outside the American Embassy did not seem to be saying too much about the gross violations of civil rights, the tortures, the imprisonments and the beatings that have been occurring in Iraq for at least eight years. Why? It is because Iraq was fighting the dreaded Ayatollah Khomeini. There is no other reason. That justified whatever went on in Iraq. It also enabled Brazil, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States and, especially, France to sell the most modern weapons of war to Iraq. Why? It is because the Iraqis were fighting the dreaded Ayatollah Khomeini. </PARA>
<PARA> So, if we go back into the Middle East over the last decade we will see that on many occasions we made mistakes, the Western alliance made mistakes, about the way we looked at the Middle East. We took a short term vision, if we can call it a vision, and our vision was one based upon fear and a misunderstanding of the Arab psyche. </PARA>
<PARA> So let us not hear the simplistic arguments that the only activists for peace are those who demonstrate against the Americans and oppose the United Nations' activities in the Middle East--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Panizza" NAMEID="JI4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Soviets were providing weapons to Iraq.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. The Soviet Union was providing Iraq with a very significant part of its very modern armoury. This was for various reasons: partly the income it earned; partly because of the influence it could have in that particular region; and partly because of fear of Muslim fundamentalism within the Soviet Union's own borders. It seemed that so many countries had their own reasons for supporting Saddam Hussein, and now we are reaping the whirlwind. But that does not in any way justify the Australian Democrats or the peace activists, so-called, who can stand back and say, `The West has come to its senses but it ought to be stopped', because at last they have stood up to someone who has gone beyond the bounds of what is accepted internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I particularly am talking now to the young people in this country, the ones who have been conned into believing that a slogan solves a problem and who believe that it is good and slightly exciting to challenge authority in this country by supporting the most authoritarian dictator in the Middle East, or at least he is neck and neck with Assad of Syria, who for the moment remains our ally, lest it not be forgotten that he is our ally. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to go through, very quickly, the nature of the Iraqi regime that has relevance to this debate. Like Sparta, the Iraqis have been a nation at war for a very long time, and they are a nation at war not necessarily because their borders have been threatened; they are a nation at war because the Baath Party and Saddam Hussein have benefited from having the country on a war footing for a decade or more. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of Baathism has been to control their population by appearing to be and genuinely engaging in, wherever possible, acts of war in order to keep the country united, to suppress dissent, and to ensure that the ruling minority stays a ruling minority. That is one part of the nature of Iraqi society. Where else would a country with a population about the same as Australia find the need to have 4,000 tanks or more, 700 planes of the most modern varieties and the most modern missiles? Why would it need to have such a large standing army and such suppression of its own citizens? Why would it need, for example, to poison the Kurds or any other minority who opposed them? Why does that regime need to keep its hand on its citizens so tightly? The answer is basically because it sees itself-many people alongside Saddam Hussein see themselves-as part of the old Babylonian empire. There is a pride there that has a lot to do with a sense of expansionism. They are not protecting their borders. Therefore, we are dealing with a different creature.</PARA>
<PARA> To the so-called peace activists I leave this message: if they do not understand the Baathist regime in Iraq or the regime in Syria, they will never understand at least one or two of the major factors in the recurring problems that plague the Middle East. Again, it is not appropriate to simply mouth slogans in order to push this Government into finding some sort of simple solution. Slogans are not solutions. This is a long term situation which sooner or later-and sooner, I hope-after this war is over must be addressed by all nations of the world, preferably through the United Nations as an appropriate forum. Let us not lose sight of the fact that there are long term objectives after this war that we have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to something that is particularly important to me as an individual and particularly important to the basic philosophy of the Labor Party: the concept of collective security. This century has been plagued, particularly in Europe but, I guess, also elsewhere in the world, by a series of wars caused by shifting alliances and the expansion of individual aggressive countries, both big and small, against their neighbours. The rollcall of our failure to resolve international problems is very long indeed: Abyssinia, the Rhineland, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, East Timor-which is a dreadful blight on Australian diplomatic skills-Cambodia and Vietnam; the list goes on and on. This is precisely because the one thing that we hoped for after the Second World War has not occurred; that is, the ability of an organisation like the United Nations to create collective security as the major concept underpinning international relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the superpowers, because of their rivalry, have been able to negate any move towards the proper use of the concept of collective security. Vetoes, backdoor vetoes, secret arms supplies, secret agreements and secret understandings have all been used to ensure that, as a world, we have not been able to bring people together to say, `These are the rules that underpin relationships between sovereign nations and these are the penalties for those who breach those rules'. Now we have a unique opportunity to create a system of collective security with appropriate policing where necessary. It will not be perfect. There will always be aggression and mistakes in diplomacy. There will always be difficulty in getting that collective force together to take ultimate action when it is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to someone I admire very greatly-Herbert Vere Evatt-not for all his viewpoints because in some areas I think he had very overt and obvious weaknesses. But the one thing he did was to put Australia, after the Second World War, at the forefront of moves towards putting into practice the concept of collective security. He was one of the founding fathers of the United Nations. If one reads the books about Herbert Vere Evatt and his efforts in San Francisco and elsewhere to bring the concept of collective security to reality, one cannot help being impressed with the way a native Australian was able to take certain fortes that we have in our character into the world theatre and to give the world something to think about and to have an effect-breaking down the dominance of the big powers in the creation of the United Nations in the way the ground rules were laid down; encouraging the smaller nations to play a role and, above all else, saying that at the heart of collective security is proper economic and social development of the have-nots. His words still ring true. If we do not solve the difference between the haves and the have-nots, the question of collective security is made all the harder. But he was right. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me, in a rather ironic way, a certain degree of pride to see that something for which Australia fought very strongly-a strong, active United Nations, in search of security for every member-could, in fact, be the result of the action that has now been taken by the United Nations in the Middle East. Many people say that that is idealistic, that it was a pinko dream back in the 1950s. It is, in fact, a realistic and sensible approach to international relationships now that the superpowers have discarded their rivalries. The option is there. The opening is there. So the message to young people is that sometimes, when the time is right, people of good intentions must stand up and be counted and they must act quickly. They must say to Saddam Hussein and others like him in other parts of the world, `There is a better way of doing things and we will not tolerate the way you are approaching things'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a strange irony of history that Saddam Hussein, who has the most modern technology in the warfare area, is really a creature of the 1930s. He is a creature of a period where the League of Nations was useless. It was not prepared to act. He is a creature of the thinking which dominated the expansionism of certain countries in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The German generals, who were anti-Hitler and wanted to see Hitler go, from 1933 onwards waited for the West to stand up to Hitler. They wanted Hitler to fail because then Hitler would lose his support at home; he would be a failure. What happened? Hitler went from success to success. There was the Rhineland. Czechoslovakia, one of the strongest standing armies in the world at that time, collapsed overnight. Then there was Austria. Every time Hitler had a win and a diplomatic success by the use of arms, fear and pressure, the stronger he became within his own country. Similarly with Mussolini. Saddam Hussein is part of that era in his thinking. I know it sounds trite to compare him with Hitler, but the same approach that was there in the 1930s with Hitler exists now with Saddam Hussein. We, as Australians, have to say, `Enough is enough. That approach-the annexation of an independent neighbour-is not acceptable'. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish on the point-being very practical because I have moved from idealism and the United Nations and have described what can be possible-that the most practical thing that can come out of this war in the Middle East and the most beneficial thing for Australia is the sure knowledge that, if we are successful in the Middle East, a lesson will have been taught to those medium-sized countries which are essentially authoritarian and which rely for their success from time to time on an appropriate war to galvanise their citizens, allowing them to put pressure on their citizens and deny their civil liberties and so on. If that message is getting through to those dictators and authoritarian nations, we are all the better off as Australians because we live in a region where there are a significant number of middle-sized powers, well armed with internal divisions and problems and essentially authoritarian, which at any time in the next decade may resort to the creation of external fears or external aggression against their neighbours for various reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> If the lesson of Kuwait is that the United Nations is prepared to stand up, with big power backing-and that is important-against such expansionist philosophies and nations, and if that lesson is learnt, Australia will be the safer for it. We can never defend ourselves on our own-not in the next decade. It is just not possible to do so. But what we can do is take part in the moves at the moment to create a new world order which does not say to smaller countries such as Australia, `You look after yourself. When the going is rough we don't want to know you'. It is the old philosophy of saying, `Oh, well, we can give up the Sudetenland; after all, they are probably Germans there anyway' and not, `Oh, well, Poland is just a country run by a group of semi-fascists'. There is always some excuse to justify doing nothing. Australia will be the better for this conflict. Initially there may be problems. Everyone has to face the reality of terrorism and the reality that people will die in this war. Everyone has to face the reality that we have said yes to a war, and that must sit on our conscience. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, if the concept of collective security becomes an accepted one and is a philosophy that can be put into practice, then Australia-and I think on the whole the family of nations around this world-will benefit. Therefore I support the Government's approach to this issue. Everyone finds it distasteful to be involved in a war, but at some time we have to make a judgment about conflicts in our region or in regions which affect us. I believe we have made the right judgment. I believe our involvement is appropriate according to our capacity. I believe our involvement is of real benefit to the allies, and psychologically our involvement is terribly important to those countries which in the future may face pressure from the likes of Saddam Hussein and others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the Parliament tonight, and indeed today, is one which should have been debated some weeks ago and which could have been debated at a much earlier time, but it would probably not have been debated at all if the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had not been forced by weight of numbers in this chamber to convene a special sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons for such anxiety to avoid the scrutiny of the Parliament ought to be obvious to all: a desperate wish to avoid antagonising the left wing factions by putting up words that it would find unacceptable. Hence we have no mention of the leadership role played by the United States, nor of the consummate diplomatic skills displayed by George Bush and his principal advisers in stitching together an unprecedented and most unlikely coalition which has operated very effectively to date, and which shows no signs of unravelling. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Saddam Hussein's blatant and clumsy attempts at provocation, the allies have managed to stick together, and even some of those most unlikely bed fellows have exhibited a maturity and astuteness which owes much to the assiduous diplomatic activities of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The war is now in its sixth day, and perhaps the most remarkable feature to date on all the known evidence is just how few deaths and casualties there have been. It is indeed paradoxical that, at a time when the world has been through two wars to end all wars and has now had some 45 years since Hiroshima to develop and perfect unimaginably powerful weapons of mass destruction, to date we are seeing a clinical war replete with surgical strikes. It is against the background of conventional wars such as East Timor and the civil war in Birundi, to name but two, which were reputed to have led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, that we now seem to have entered an era or maybe only a phase when the principal targets are objects and not subjects. Perhaps this is due to the powerful deterrent effects of televised mass killings, one of the major lessons learned from the Vietnam conflict. It is almost miraculous that two Scud missile attacks on large Israeli population centres have apparently not killed a single person. We do not know whether this is due to the effectiveness of Israel's preparations or to the ineptness and inadequacy of Saddam's missile capability. Either way it has been little more than a token assault the prime purpose of which was always intended to be symbolic. </PARA>
<PARA> But all the evidence to date justifies the decision to take on Saddam Hussein. The alternative would have been no alternative at all-pandering to an egomaniac who has been impervious to all attempts to reason and negotiate. Those who are determined to argue that there was an alternative like to pretend that sanctions would have worked, but even the tightest noose will only be effective against a ruler who is responsive and responsible to his people. Saddam's track record clearly indicates the opposite. He has consistently brooked no opposition, exterminated political opponents, gassed the defenceless Kurds, and obsessed with the glories of pan-Arabism and the struggle, he is not susceptible to logic, argument or negotiation. Saddam understands only force and terror and will yield when forced to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways we are a product of our own cultures, and those of us who lead comfortable middle class lives often find it very difficult to understand how there can be such people in the world who are not similarly as reasonable and sensible as we are. I think it does require quite an effort at times to try to comprehend what motivates others with cultures entirely alien to our own and what is likely to persuade them to see what we regard as sweet reason. That I think is one of the regrettable features of the opposition to this motion in the Parliament, because in many ways I think there are a number of professional peace activists, and others seeking their votes, who refuse to analyse the options or concede that there are times when force as a last resort must be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is at least very encouraging to find spokesmen for several of the major churches being prepared to stand up and be counted. We can all wring our hands and wish that it were not so. It is much harder to take the tough decisions and see them through. I therefore congratulate the Catholic and Anglican churches for having the courage to show moral leadership and accept that enough is enough. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to imagine a more clear cut case of brutal and unjustified aggression-the act of a megalomaniac or bully prepared to rape, pillage and plunder without compunction-yet what do those who oppose this option argue? If you are an Australian Democrat you first argued that the United Nations was the appropriate arbiter, not the United States of America, and that when the United Nations decided overwhelmingly to support a measured, and if necessary, forcible response, the argument changed. Now it is that sanctions ought to be given more time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think one needs to resort to the Central Intelligence Agency to understand the likely limited effectiveness of sanctions. If one is dealing with a rational ruler of a democracy and one who is likely to be responsive to public pressures, then one might have some real prospects. The way in which Mr Hawke goes to water every time there is a tough decision shows us how acutely sensitive some leaders can be. But we are dealing with a vastly different proposition when we have someone who has been prepared to embark upon what turned out to be an eight year war, one which he thought would be over fairly quickly, but one where he thought there was a political advantage to be gained-aspiring to leadership of the Arab world-and was prepared to sacrifice untold millions of dollars, and certainly up to a million lives in the pursuit of a goal which he achieved with very limited success and which he immediately forsook when he saw another opportunity for further aggrandisement. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of behaviour could not be tolerated for a moment under any rational regime, and nor could people who were not cowered by years of brutal oppression, tyranny, persecution and execution have copped it for a moment, but of course cop it they do because they have no choice, and therefore the prospects of Saddam Hussein yielding to democratic pressures from within his own country or somehow being susceptible to moral suasion from the international community is not only remote in the extreme but verging on the self delusory. Therefore I find it interesting to canvass some of the arguments put forward by the Democrats, and in particular, Senator Vallentine who of course is the self-proclaimed leading peace activist in the nation. </PARA>

Timor is not comparable, much as there are those who might wish that Mr Whitlam had not given the encouragement that he did, in the face of a vacuum and in the face of a very powerful adjoining country which took the view that a departing colonial power had left a territory which it regarded as geographically proximate and, therefore, capable of being absorbed. That in no way can be compared to the actions of a state such as Kuwait which was not about to be vacated by a colonial power, and which was conducting its business in the same way that many other distasteful regimes-to Senator Spindler-are able to conduct their own business, and no-one advocates that they ought to be forcibly removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motives for Saddam Hussein invading Kuwait would seem to be primarily economic. I do not think we ought to apologise for a moment. If one nation, which has something like 10 per cent of the world's oil resources under its power and control, not only seeks to take over another 10 per cent in Kuwait but makes all sorts of indications that ought to be taken seriously about acquiring the reserves of Saudi Arabia and, therefore, to have control of perhaps 50 per cent of the world's resources, we ought to be very concerned about that. It is not just another action which is harmless to the world community; it is an action that can virtually hold the world hostage. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless one is prepared to stand up and take action against those sorts of acts of blatant aggression, they can only be encouraged in the short term and, in the long term, they become an invitation to anarchy and the law of the jungle. That, I would have thought, is the last thing that those opposing this motion would profess to want to see. Indeed, when one looks at the history of the United Nations, one sees that for many years the West has despaired that it has never been able to get its act together. Apart from the occasional peacekeeping force that has been sent into places such as Cyprus and Kashmir, it has manifestly been unable to reach a conclusion that was in the best interests of the international community, largely because some nations have been prepared to exercise a blind veto. </PARA>
<PARA> It has only been in very recent times, with the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and a realisation by the Soviet Union that it is economically if not morally bankrupt, that these nations have come to their senses and been prepared to make reasonable decisions in the Security Council. That having occurred, it provides the United Nations, for almost the first time, with an ability to carry out the job that it was charged to do in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The very people who now oppose this motion are those who for many years have always said that they do not condone the activities of the superpowers; that they do not believe that might is right but that these matters ought to be resolved in that international democratic forum, the United Nations. If that is the view that they have held for so long and have promoted in this and other forums, I cannot for the life of me see any logical or moral justification for the attitude that Senator Vallentine in particular has adopted to the latest series of UN resolutions. Make no mistake about it, Senator Vallentine is no international democrat. She simply says:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not care whether the United Nations Security Council agreed to it with two negative votes and one abstention, it is wrong . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the United Nations did that, there would not be any sane person on the face of the earth who would want the type of war that might be unleashed in the Middle East-United Nations permission granted, or not . . . The United Nations can make mistakes. I think resolution 678 is a grave mistake. </PARA>
<PARA>How can one pretend to aspire to a democratic world order where decisions are made by the majority and not just the mighty, yet when we have an overwhelmingly one-sided result in both the General Assembly and the Security Council, we simply refuse to accept the outcome? That, I suggest, is not only morally superior; it is intolerant and utterly undemocratic. That is the problem with saying that sanctions ought to be given more time to work. If they do not, what does one do? One ends up wringing one's hands. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, what Senator Vallentine had to say about sanctions is virtually breathtaking. Her best argument is that in South Africa it took 12 years--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does Senator Powell agree with Senator Vallentine's views? Let me recite hers and we can see whether Senator Powell still does. Senator Vallentine said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . Prime Minister, let the sanctions work. It took 12 years to find that the sanctions worked in South Africa. In the meantime, the black South African people have suffered and continue to suffer. The sanctions finally worked there without a military blockade to back them up. Why could not time have been allowed in the Gulf for the sanctions to work?</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot comprehend that Senator Vallentine or Senator Powell could seriously imagine that waiting even 12 months could do anything other than exacerbate the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> South Africa is not even a comparable case study, as we all know, because there 20 per cent of the population is in power, hoping to preside permanently over the other 80 per cent. I would not have thought time was on their side. Whether or not it is sanctions that have brought about the changes and upheavals in South Africa is still debatable. </PARA>
<PARA> If we just take at face value the proposition that if we are prepared to wait 12 years we might get somewhere, we can see what preposterous and ludicrous nonsense the proposition is in the Gulf context. When someone has thumbed his nose at the world community, has been prepared to use even the 5 1/2 months that have elapsed since the first invasion not only to prop up his own forces in the region but also to dig into Kuwait, to pillage that country and remove all that was worthwhile, to appropriate it and annexe it as the nineteenth province of Iraq, one can imagine what would have happened if he had been given another six months or more-another 11 1/2 years-to go about his business and remain, presumably and inevitably, just as impervious to logic, criticism, persuasion and negotiation as he has proved to date. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we are talking about an utterly intransigent tyrant who is not amenable to logic, is not amenable to persuasion, and does not live in the same beautiful world that Senator Vallentine would like to see where everyone sits around the table and is reasonable and comes up with a negotiated solution that is satisfactory to all sides. This is not the Industrial Relations Commission. This is not simply another party to a dispute that one would like call in and say, `Come on, be reasonable. What is your bottom line?'. This is someone who has no compunction about using nerve gas, about exterminating his own political opponents, and about putting the Kurds out of business as a minority people in his own country-someone who will simply stop at nothing. We have seen that over the last 4 1/2 months. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that if ever there was a good example of not rushing precipitately into a conflict, it is the behaviour pattern that we have seen from the United States, the nation, as I say, that gets no credit at all in this motion, obviously for factional reasons. Nonetheless, I am sure that the majority on the other side of the chamber would acknowledge that what President Bush has managed to do to date is embark on a very skilful exercise in diplomacy that has locked in a number of very unlikely players. </PARA>

In other words, it was deliberately set up with five permanent members who were the most powerful players on the world scene in 1945 and it has since been expanded to the point where there are 10 rotating members. When there is a majority of 12 out of 15, one would think that we are being told something: that it is not just one person's or one nation's view of the world; that it represents a very widespread view of what is morally right and wrong. No-one wants to see a rush to war. In whose interest is that? It is certainly not in the moral interest of anyone. Yet, when we have that overwhelming majority view, those opposing the motion somehow pretend that that in itself is an illegitimate decision. I find that incomprehensible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I totally oppose Australian involvement in this war. It is a very sad duty even to have to address this issue of Australia being at war. It is the mark of an uncivilised nation to respond to aggression with more violence. War debases and dehumanises our society. At this stage of human development we ought to be more enlightened, particularly because of the possible use of weapons of mass destruction. There just has to be a better way. I do not believe that this is a last resort; we have far from exhausted all other avenues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> International protests against the war were held on 19 January to mark the birthday of Martin Luther King. There is a national holiday in the United States to respect the amazing work of this man of non-violence. He is respected not only by the church community and the black community, for which he worked so hard, but also by mainstream American society. What would he be saying in the present situation? He would be advocating mediation. He would be advocating non-violence. What would Mahatma Gandhi be saying in this present situation? He would also be advocating non-violence. What would Jesus Christ be saying in this situation? He would also be advocating non-violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The churches have at last come out internationally against the war option. Contrary to what Senator Alston said, the Pope himself has spoken in opposition to the war option. The Catholic churches, which earlier in this argument were not supportive of the anti-war situation, now have the Pope to contend with on that score. Generally, churches are more enlightened than some of their predecessors, which have in the past tried to justify war in the name of Jesus Christ. The Crusades and the Inquisition are among the atrocities committed in the name of this man of peace. The churches are not justifying war this time because they know it is wrong. They know war will solve nothing but will exacerbate the problems of the Middle East. I encourage them to go further and to lead their congregations in civil disobedience and to let their governments know that the war must stop, and stop soon. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not prepared to support the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the motion before the Senate today. I will counter some of the baseless allegations he and other Government Ministers, members and senators have made against the peace movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to make it quite clear from the outset that I am opposed to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, as I am opposed to any act of international aggression. Furthermore, I put it firmly on record that the peace movement is not advocating appeasement, nor is there any parallel with the 1930s in this respect. No-one is saying that Saddam Hussein should keep Kuwait, which is vastly different from the Japanese situation when it took over Manchuria; vastly different from when Italy occupied Abyssinia; and vastly different from when Germany occupied Czechoslovakia. That is a scandalous allegation and an invalid comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental difference between the peace movement and this Government, and for that matter the coalition, is over the way in which we seek to resolve this conflict. The Government advocates the early war option or, as the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) put it, `going in with all guns blazing', while the peace movement advocates continued sanctions and negotiations. No-one here is advocating appeasement. There is a huge difference between this situation and the Hitler scenario, and that is that he had a huge industrial-military complex to continue his aggression unabated. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein has been able to fight war for eight years only with outside help. More of that later. But freeze the arms supplies, as the United Nations (UN) embargo would have done, and Saddam Hussein would not have been able to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Another allegation is that the peace movement is anti-American. This charge is frequently levied in order to discredit critics of the United States' role in the world today. It fails of course to distinguish between criticism of the United States and its people and criticism of United States Government policy, which is an entirely different matter. The peace movement in Australia has always worked closely with the peace movement in the United States. We have coordinated the dates of our rallies in North America and Australia, hosted United States anti-war speakers-of whom there are plenty-and supported United States marines who have opted not to fight for United States oil interests in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Our quarrel is with the policies of the Bush Administration and the forces which propelled it into war and the military-industrial complex which former President Eisenhower warned about as he left office. The Prime Minister has said that there is no comparison between the Gulf war and the Vietnam war, although I would have thought that the parallels were obvious. I note with some irony that there are a number of Government Ministers and members of parliament who were prominent in the movement against the Vietnam war but who now support the war option in the Gulf. I mention just a few Ministers from my own State-Kim Beazley, John Dawkins, Peter Cook and Bob McMullan, who was in Western Australia at the time of the Vietnam moratorium movement. They do amazing somersaults when it suits their politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sad and angry that the Government is too frightened to allow its own members a conscience vote on our participation in the Gulf war. Public opinion in this country is not wholeheartedly in support of the war option. Indeed, according to the Saulwick poll in the Sydney Morning Herald in December 1990, only 43 per cent of women are in favour of it. There is a gender difference there, which is hardly surprising. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a travesty of our political system that the bipartisan position of the two major parties on foreign policy means that they can never truly represent public opinion on issues such as our commitment to yet another foreign war on foreign soil. This is the most important issue to come before this Parliament in 25 years and all we are getting is set party pieces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has ignored the historic sequence of events whereby the United States moved troops into the Gulf and only then brought in other troops to make up a multinational force and lobbied the other four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to support it. Nor did he mention his own role in deciding to send Australian naval forces to serve in the Gulf, then getting the Australian Embassy in Washington to arrange a telephone call between himself and President Bush to firm up the arrangement, a sequence outlined in the Sydney Morning Herald on 1 September last year. In fact, he was so enthusiastic that he offered five ships before realising that we did not have five ships to send. So, of course, our contribution is three. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of discussion over the role of the United Nations in this conflict. What is really at issue is the interpretation of article 51 of the UN charter, which affirms the right of individual and collective self-defence. I believe that the United Nations was established to put an end to fighting, not to authorise the bombing and long haul bloody ground war that we are now contemplating in Iraq rather than just the liberation of Kuwait which, of course, will be the destruction of Kuwait. The United Nations should be a peace making and peacekeeping body, not a war fighting body. The people of Korea are still suffering from the United Nations' previous error in fighting a war there in the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has justified its position in the Gulf war by stressing its obligations under the UN charter. However, there is no obligation to commit troops to fight. I have heard no criticism whatsoever of the 131 member countries of the United Nations which are not involved in this war. It was a matter of choice and Australia chose because the Prime Minister pushed Australia to fight in this war. A mere 28 out of 159 nations have chosen to go to war; there is no United Nations obligation. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Powell pointed out resolution 678 was not a compulsion to use force by any stretch of the imagination. The Government has argued that sanctions will take too long to work. As Senator Powell has already pointed out, this is at some variance with a Central Intelligence Agency report, although we do not always believe the CIA, where its Director, William Webster, testified on Capitol Hill in Washington-so we would hope he was speaking the truth-before the Congress of the United States that Iraqi exports had been slashed by 97 per cent and its imports by 90 per cent since the implementation of the sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not pretend that sanctions will work overnight but sanctions were given only five months and we are told they have not worked yet. None of the people supporting the war option are saying that a war lasting months will also be a failure. There is no mention either of the cost as long as oil prices do not rocket. Of course the taxpayers will be picking up the bill for this expensive and destructive exercise for years, and at the cost of social programs which are vastly more important. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further irony in the way in which other issues have been put on the backburner in order to solicit world support for the US-inspired blockade. China has suddenly been rehabilitated; Syria, which until August was officially on record as a terrorist state, is now part of the multinational force, despite the atrocities carried out against its own people by the regime of President Assad; and Soviet military intervention in Lithuania has virtually been ignored. All this has been done in order to maintain the facade of unity against Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> We then have to ask: who created this monster, as the media like to portray Saddam Hussein? Senator Evans referred to the enormous military forces amassed by Iraq, but he did not say who provided them. The Stockholm Peace Research Institute has recorded that some 30 countries armed Iraq between 1980 and 1988. For the record let me list them: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, France, West Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, North Korea, The Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia sold arms to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war- great morality-while Ethiopia, Egypt, Jordan and the Philippines sold arms only to Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Western intelligence officials and a variety of military experts, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was able to amass the most powerful items of his arsenal by appealing to two strong emotions among his foreign suppliers: firstly, their hunger for Iraqi petrodollars and, secondly, in the West particularly, their fear of an Iranian victory in the 1980 Gulf war. Between 1980 and 1988 Iraq became the largest retail buyer of arms in the world, spending $US43 billion for weapons deliveries by the end of 1987, the last year for which figures are available. That is according to the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> After he came to power in 1979, sometimes with deception but often with the silent acquiescence of Western governments, Saddam Hussein was able to acquire the machines, components, tools and expertise to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. A confidential report to the German Parliament in August 1990 by Economic Minister Helmut Hausmann said West German companies were the main suppliers for all of Iraq's major weapons projects, including its nuclear weapons project, poison gas facilities, ballistic missiles, and long-range super cannon development. With West German assistance, the report says, Iraq is now believed to be five years away from producing its own nuclear bomb. In the United States, Commerce Department figures show that between 1985 and 1990 the United States approved the export to Iraq of $US1.5 billion-worth of dual-use items with military as well as civilian application, including powerful computers, precision machine tools and advanced electronics. </PARA>
<PARA> Although suspicions by Pentagon officials halted the export of certain items, such as kyrton nuclear triggers and `skull' furnaces which could be used in the development of missiles and nuclear bombs, many other sophisticated items were sent to Iraq and are believed to have enhanced Saddam Hussein's chemical war machine, his missile development program, intelligence gathering capability and battlefield communications, according to Pentagon officials. Michael Maloof, Director of Technology Security Operations at the Pentagon's Department for Trade Security Policy, says:</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that our guys in the desert are now facing sophisticated American technology sold to the Iraqis over the years by the Commerce Department. </PARA>
<PARA>So, who is to blame for the situation in which we find ourselves now? All we are trying to do is disable the military machine which the West in particular helped to create. Yet a public opinion poll indicates that 73 per cent of Americans are not even aware of the fact that the United States sold arms to Iraq between 1980 and 1988. I suspect too that even fewer Australians are aware of this and of the fact that Australia was prepared to sell military equipment to the same regime last year. The media is having a field day describing the high tech weapons in the desert, but they seem curiously silent about who sold them to Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade credits were largely provided by the United States and the United Kingdom, yet this was the regime which invaded Iran in 1980 just as it invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and the world stayed silent. Iraq was confidently backed by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states because it held the balance of power in the region-a balance which is now being upset by the stated US aim of wiping Iraq out as a military power. The long term US presence will not only strengthen Iran and Israel-the traditional enemies of the conservative oil states-but will also strengthen the forces of fundamentalist Islam throughout the Middle East and the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much criticism of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in this crisis, but the PLO is rapidly losing ground to the fundamentalist movement, Hamas, especially in the Gaza Strip and especially amongst young people. Israel, tacitly supported by the United States, has managed to block off UN resolutions on the occupied territories since 1967. However, if it thought the PLO was too extreme to talk to, it has not yet met Hamas. The PLO has had it on record for over two years that it supports the right of Israel to exist, and still Israel is not prepared to talk to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in his proposed resolution refers to an eventual settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it is not acknowledged that the problem will be much harder as a result of this war. It is ironic to note that the Prime Minister now calls for Palestine to go onto the agenda after the crisis-war-because had he said that before the war, the war might have been averted. It is one of the things called for to be put on the international agenda. Clearly, linkage, so adamantly resistant by the US, is vital and the Prime Minister now recognises this. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that Iraq is developing a nuclear capability, but no one seems willing to get up and say where Saddam Hussein got it from, which is curious, to say the least. Nor has anyone said why, if it is wrong for Iraq to have nuclear weapons, we keep quiet about Israel's nuclear weapons and the imprisonment of Mordecai Vanunu for telling the truth about that Israeli nuclear arsenal. I suggest that this proliferation in such an unstable part of the world is sound justification for declaring that all nuclear weapons are immoral and cutting off this proliferation at source is imperative. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard, too, of the atrocities of Saddam Hussein since 1979. However, we have not heard a good explanation of why the world acquiesced in the invasion of Iran in 1980 and why there was an uneasy silence over the use of chemical weapons at Halabja in 1988. Did anyone from this Government speak to the Kurds who demonstrated outside Parliament House at the time or listen to their tales of horror? After the prior Gulf war was over in 1988, even Australia was prepared to sell weapons to this atrocious regime, although the deal in aircraft spare parts was called off after the 2 August invasion. Indeed the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) said last year that he saw nothing wrong with the proposed sale. When the Prime Minister announced that we were at war, he spoke of the new international order. What is new about an international order based on the firepower that is now amassed in the Arabian desert?</PARA>
<PARA> Supporters of the war option have said that the peace movement should put forward an alternative. From the outset I have suggested a negotiating position. In a speech in the Senate on 19 December last year I detailed that; I will reiterate the main points now. An alternative is not based on appeasement nor on rewarding Saddam Hussein. I outlined a three-step approach to the conflict in the Gulf suggesting possible solutions to the issue of the disputed islands of Bubiyan and Warbah, the al-Rumeilah oil field and the long term wider problems in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I drew an analogy with the Aland Islands in the Baltic which were the subject of a dispute between Sweden and Finland after the First World War. That issue was resolved when the Council of the League of Nations adjudicated in favour of a demilitarised zone which has stood to this day, while the islands remain part of Finland. Disputes over oil fields across national boundaries can be resolved by negotiation just as Australia settled the dispute with Indonesia over the Timor Sea oil reserves, although it took a long time. It is unfortunate that we were negotiating with the wrong country in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the general conference on the Middle East, I drew an analogy with the Congress of Vienna in Europe in 1814-15 following the ravages of the Napoleonic wars that lasted over 20 years. Such a conference could be in three stages: stage 1 could cover Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait; stage 2 could deal with the Israeli-Palestine issue; stage 3 could set up a stable government in the Lebanon with UN guarantees. At each level the UN or the Arab League would be needed either as observers or to act as peacekeepers, and certainly as guarantors of agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> It might take years but the problems will remain whether we choose to pour more arms into the area for future wars or patiently attempt to work them out over many months, if not years. These problems go back decades and they will not be solved overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> Nearer to Australia than the Gulf is Cambodia. Australia chose to play a more constructive negotiating role in that conflict, although I believe that Pol Pot has been more of a monster than Saddam Hussein, yet the world community chose to allow his representatives to occupy a seat at the United Nations for many years. This is the selective indignation that we can no longer tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Arab masses are puzzled why the United States can disregard United Nations resolutions on Palestine since 1967, especially resolution 262, and later ones on Lebanon, but act so fast over Kuwait. Others look at the new found enthusiasm of the United States for the United Nations and think back to the blatant disregard for UN resolutions shown by the United States over the invasion of Panama. It was also a disgrace that Mr Hawke instructed the Australian delegation to change its position and to vote against the UN resolution criticising US interventionism in Panama just over a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was the refusal of the United States Government to acknowledge the authority of the International Court of Justice when it mined Nicaragua's harbours. It completely ignored it. Nearer home again, we have the appalling hypocrisy of this Government over Indonesia's invasion of East Timor. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) could only lamely say in answer to my question on this parallel last month that this unfortunate invasion happened in 1975 and it was a bit late to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I reflected that Australia had refused to acknowledge the Soviet Union's illegal jurisdiction over the Baltic states for more than 50 years, but somehow this too was different. The Government's hypocrisy over East Timor is blatant and disgraceful. We must and we will change government policy to ensure self-determination for the people of East Timor. The Government claims public support for its position, yet public opinion polls indicate that only 56 per cent support the decision to send war ships to the Gulf to use force to eject Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a savage indictment of Parliament that only a handful of senators and one member of the House of Representatives are speaking out on behalf of this substantial number of Australians who can see what this conflict is really about and believe that there is another way to solve it. There has been much greater debate in Europe and North America than in Australia even though these countries too have joined the multinational force. It was a close debate in the United States Senate and President Bush only got his war making powers authorised by 52 votes to 47. One of his critics was the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam Nunn. During the debate he asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Will I be able to say to the families of the Americans in the Middle East that their loved ones sacrificed their lives for a cause vital to the United States and that there was no other reasonable alternative? At this time I cannot. </PARA>
<PARA>Other leading senators urged Mr Bush to allow sanctions to work, arguing that sufficient time had not been given for them to do so. Yet in Australia, Australian Labor Party (ALP) criticism has once again been muzzled by the Prime Minister, although at the State level MPs have been less inclined to keep quiet. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to my colleagues from the Labor Party in the West Australian Alliance for Peace in the Middle East who have had the courage to speak out, along with other ALP members of State parliaments in Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, and possibly other States. I only wish that their Federal counterparts had been allowed a conscience vote on this issue and permitted to speak out here in Canberra as well. Indeed, it is a waste of time and money for Parliament to return for set pieces. War is government legalised and government organised mass murder on a grand scale at the taxpayers expense. The taxpayers just see set pieces and people are not able to speak from their hearts about this concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention the concerns expressed about the use of US bases in Australia in this Gulf conflict. As Dr Michael McKinley and Dr Desmond Ball at the Australian National University have put on the record, Pine Gap, Nurrungar and North West Cape are all playing an active part in this war, although we shall not hear any acknowledgment of this fact from the Minister for Defence. It therefore seems too important to put it on the record, given that this involvement clearly alters Australia's traditional even-handed policy on the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Pine Gap would be picking up communications within Iraq, which is based on microwave transmission, and the same would occur between Iraq and Kuwait. All communications which have microwave links as their bases would be monitored by Pine Gap. Nurrungar which is hooked up to the DSP satellites is picking up the Scud missile launches. This information is then downlinked into Nurrungar and relayed to central command communication headquarters in Saudi Arabia, and presumably from there to Israel where the information could be used by the crews of the Patriot anti-missile missile. </PARA>
<PARA> North West Cape passes on communications to US naval forces in the Gulf. Given the current situation most, if not all, of the information would be handled by the US staff despite the myth of the joint facilities. Why can the Government not admit this and end the farce of referring to an obsolete non-statement on the basis made by the Prime Minister several years ago which says precisely nothing? We should never have allowed the setting up of these US bases in Australia in the first place and the sooner we close them down completely, the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as the interjections about Israel are concerned, Iraq would not have launched its attack on Israel had not the multinational forces been engaged in the Gulf. This is a classic case of violence producing more violence and aggression producing more aggression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to environmental issues. Warfare in the Gulf would be an environmental disaster. While some of the likely impacts are familiar from past conflicts, others will be unique because of the intense fire power now concentrated in the region and because of its distinctive geography and ecology. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer, firstly, to burning oil. Oil fires and oil contamination are the most serious environmental hazards of a war in the Gulf. Smoke, soot and chemicals produced by the burning of oil wells and facilities could cause temporary regional or global cooling. One hundred days of burning would produce a cloud of smoke covering half the northern hemisphere lasting months if not years. The cloud would threaten agricultural production. Agriculture as far away as India could be affected by the cooling and disruption of the monsoons. The result could be mass starvation of people with little or no stake in the conflict. Oil fields set alight deliberately would take a very long time to put out. There are only four or five crews in the world experienced in putting out oil well fires. It could take months, if not years, to put out the fires. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the question of the spilling of oil. Oil will flow into the Gulf from military attacks on refineries, oil terminals, storage tanks, pipelines, offshore wells and tankers. A single storage tank can hold as much as was spilled by the Exxon Valdez, the United States' worst oil spill. The shallow and relatively enclosed nature of the Gulf will worsen any impact from oil spills and its currents will carry any oil towards the shores of Saudi Arabia and nearby nations threatening desalination plants vital to making fresh water for drinking and agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of destroying the deserts. The deployment of more than one million troops in the Gulf deserts has already disrupted their rich and delicate ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am including them. Armies generally produce prodigious amounts of garbage, toxic waste and sewage. It is unlikely that in the rush to deploy and reinforce troops any of the armies have taken much care to ensure that their wastes are being disposed of properly. Digging and traffic in the desert are disturbing and destroying plants and wildlife and generating dust storms. Deserts, which are very fragile environments, are susceptible to increasing erosion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also the question of explosive remnants. Nearly every modern war has littered its battlefields with unexploded bombs, mines and shells. All bombs and missiles do not work as planned and buried explosives cause casualties long after the fighting stops. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is chemical contamination. Nerve gases are volatile and will dissipate within hours or days. However, exposure can cause a quick death to any living thing without a gas mask. Mustard gas is much more persistent and does not break down readily. Unexploded chemical shells could cause local tragedy if set off. The destruction of chemical weapons production and storage facilities could rupture storage containers or bombs releasing the chemicals whether they are deliberately used or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the nuclear legacy. Destruction of nuclear facilities or weapons, even if they are not exploded, would release an array of radioactive substances. Nuclear explosions would spread short and long lived radioactivity over a wide area. The impact of attacks on nuclear facilities in the region, such as Israel's major nuclear weapons complex at Dimona, Iraq's smaller research reactors or United States nuclear-powered war ships would also spread radioactivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the water war. The possible destruction of Iraq's dykes, dams and other irrigation structures could decimate agricultural production in the fertile valley of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. These waters have made possible the cultivation of arid land for centuries, turning Iraq into the breadbasket of the Gulf. Archaeological treasures in this area, one of the cradles of civilisation, are in the battle zone and could be lost forever. </PARA>
<PARA> The rich marshlands at the mouths of the two rivers which host migratory water fowl are also at risk. Grazing areas already overstressed would be devastated. Massive amounts of refugees fleeing the war zone and induced environmental contamination would further strain resources and ecosystems in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to salute the members of the international Gulf peace team who went to the Iraq-Saudi border to witness their conviction that war was not the right way to resolve this conflict. They are extremely brave. I hope they come back safely. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to express once more my concern for the Arab-Australian community facing a racist backlash and to reiterate my concern for Australian Defence Force personnel and their families and to wish our forces a safe and speedy return home. I grieve for the innocent victims of this war, whether they be in Kuwait, Iraq, Israel or any other country which may become directly involved at a later date. In totally objecting to Australia's involvement in this war I therefore call for an immediate cease-fire in the Gulf and an immediate stop to all Australian support for this war which should never have happened. </PARA>
