<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The curious title of this Bill, which amends a number of Acts, is the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. It is rather fortunate that the Bill does not presume to name a Prime Minister or the Cabinet because, from the number of Government senators in the chamber this morning, it is fairly obvious that the leadership battle continues, the factions are meeting and the Caucus groups are getting together. I would think that the Prime Minister we have now will not be the Prime Minister we have by the end of the year or early in the New Year. As I say, it is rather fortunate that there are no names mentioned in the title to this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, under that broad name, amends a number of Acts. The first is the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. The amendments will empower the Ombudsman to seek advisory opinions from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about matters which are being investigated by the internal investigations division of the Australian Federal Police and the Ombudsman. The legislation also amends the Governor-General Act 1974 to omit a provision which, on remarriage, removed the entitlement to an allowance of the surviving spouse of a retired Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill further amends the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 to enable the appointment of an Acting Inspector-General in the event of the absence of the Inspector-General or of a temporary vacancy in that office. It also enables the Inspector-General to require the intelligence and securities agencies to supply copies of annual or periodic reports and, where relevant, ministerial directions or guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the Bill amends the Ombudsman's Act to empower the Ombudsman to seek advisory opinions from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about matters which the Ombudsman is investigating and enables the Ombudsman to take further action on a matter which is the subject of a report to parliament. The Bill further ensures that the power of the Ombudsman to obtain documents overrides any prohibition in any other Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of this Bill which concerned the coalition was the proposal to refuse professional privilege as an excuse for denying the Ombudsman access to information. However, upon our investigation, it appears that the Act really only clarifies what has in fact been the existing situation whilst ensuring that information obtained cannot otherwise be used in breach of legal professional privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also amends the Resource Assessment Act 1989 to exclude the Norfolk Island Government from the definition of a `Commonwealth Authority' in the Act, ensuring that a decision of that Government cannot be reviewed by the Resource Assessment Commission. In line with the coalition's policy to abolish the Resource Assessment Commission, I must say that I agree with the sentiments expressed by the ALP member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell, who in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 5 November 1991, spoke of this move to remove the Norfolk Island Government from the clutches of the Resource Assessment Commission. Mr Campbell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Government to make this the first in a step by step process in which we can exempt everyone else from the Resource Assessment Commission Act.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a shame that other members of the Government are not as open-minded or as courageous as Mr Campbell to propose, as he does, a course of action which is in line with the coalition's policy&mdash;that is, getting rid of the Resource Assessment Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of Bills covered by this legislation deal generally with the Public Service. The Merit Protection Act is amended to enable meetings of the Merit Protection Review Agency to be held either in person or by electronic means. In addition, other amendments allow for the imposition of a fine on those present at proceedings who fail to comply with orders or published orders in defiance of orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service Act is amended to implement the restructuring of the Senior Executive Service into three bands, increasing the flexibility of arrangements by giving greater responsibility for deploying SES officers to heads of departments and agencies, and simplifying procedures for deployment. The Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act is also amended by this Bill to provide that a woman on unpaid maternity leave, which can last for a year, does not become an unattached officer without her written consent. This brings maternity leave into conformity with other forms of unpaid leave in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Public Service Reform Act repeal a section which is unproclaimed and is no longer required. That is a good move which the Liberal and National parties support. It is also a move which the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills is very keen on. Bills that have not been proclaimed should be removed from the statute book, and this Bill does that. That is in accordance with Scrutiny of Bills Committee recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill amends numerous Acts to allow statutory authorities to determine terms and conditions of employment for their employees without the approval of the Public Service Commission. According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), this is consistent with government policy of devolving responsibility to managers&mdash;a policy which the Liberal and National parties have long promoted. I am pleased to see that in his speech the Minister pays at least lip service to that, if not a real intent. At the same time as the Minister said this, he stressed that despite the changes statutory heads will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . remain covered by the Government's industrial relations and co-ordination arrangements, which ensure the consistent application of the Government's wages and industrial relations policies.</PARA>
<PARA>By that statement, the Minister negates the flexibility which the Liberal and National parties believe is essential to good managerial practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally the Opposition has no particular objection to any of the amendments proposed in the Bill; indeed, we support the direction and the thrust of a number of the amendments. However, given the Government's stubborn resistance to genuine industrial relations reform, reinforced in the statement I just mentioned from the Minister's speech, it is appropriate to voice our concerns about the approach being taken by the Government in industrial relations matters generally. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate deplores the Government's failure to acknowledge Commonwealth employees' freedom to associate, and the Government's failure to capture the productivity improvements to be had from enterprise bargaining within the federal Public Service by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)proscribing compulsory membership of trade unions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)proscribing preference for trade unionists in awards and federal legislation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)abolishing automatic deduction of union dues within Commonwealth departments and authorities; and by</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)giving the chief executive officers of Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities the same responsibility as their private sector counterparts in deciding the size, composition, deployment, pay and conditions of employees, subject only to a budget constraint".</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment highlights the Government's continuing failure to properly address the nagging industrial relations reform issues instead of just simply doing what it is doing&mdash;tinkering around the edges. We welcome the changes in the Public Service which will give managers more responsibility in allocating their resources but the Government, unfortunately, has not gone far enough. It does this, I suspect, because it is too scared to take the four decisions in industrial reform which have to be taken. They are the four principles which are central to the coalition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, we believe that there should be freedom for employers and employees to make legally enforceable agreements on their own terms and conditions without the mandatory intervention of unions, employer groups or a tribunal. Secondly, we believe that workers should be free and have the right to choose whether they want to belong to a union or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we believe and support an adherence to the principle that, if unions destroy the livelihoods of people or companies, then they should be made to pay for the damage, in the same way all sections of our society are accountable before the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at this stage there is no guarantee that the Labor Party will not repeal the protection from section 45D against the irresponsible actions of irresponsible unions. If unions do take action irresponsibly which causes damage and causes hurt, harm and financial distress to people or to companies, then they should be made to pay for it. Mr Acting Deputy President, if you did some wrong that caused financial harm to someone, you would be required by the laws of the land to pay for it, to compensate the person who had been hurt. So should the unions. Mr Acting Deputy President, there should not be one law for you, one law for me, and yet another law for the privileged section in our community&mdash;the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an indication within the ranks of the Labor Party that they are trying to remove the section 45D protection. Senator Cook abandoned very recently his plan to multiply by five the fines applicable to unions after caving in to ACTU pressure. People on the Labor side of this chamber will remember Senator Cook getting rousing cheers at the Caucus meeting for his courage on the industrial relations reform he was supposed to be implementing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That afternoon Comrade Kelty called in on Senator Cook and told him that he could not introduce that legislation because it was contrary to the wishes of the ACTU. Brave Senator Cook, as usual, caved in to the wishes and dictates of the bully boys and the union bosses in the ACTU. So this legislation, which he is so proud of, which was reported widely in the papers at the time, did not come in because Senator Cook did not have the intestinal fortitude to stand up for what was right and to stand up to the bully boys in the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That simply reinforces my concern and allows me to muse aloud again as to just who is running this Government. It does seem to me that the Minister and the elected Labor Party Caucus come up with some sort of policy which seems to be good and then Comrade Kelty comes along and says, `You can't do that;  you are not allowed to introduce it'. Does it not concern you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this sort of thing should happen in an Australian democracy? It is not the Labor Party or the Government running the country; it is a third body, the Australian Council of Trade Unions&mdash;the union movement&mdash;which is pulling the strings of the puppets in the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, we believe there should be a right to join a union, regardless of size, or to form one, with workers not being forced to join a nominated super union which the Government and the Australian Democrats have formed by banning unions with less than 10,000 members. In spite of the fact that the Democrats some years ago opposed that, they were again bought off in a deal with the Government&mdash;30 pieces of silver, $2m worth of free advertising or extra staff or whatever&mdash;and agreed with the Government on these super unions of 10,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are issues which the Government must address. By holding out it is prolonging the inevitable. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Liberal and National parties will push each and every one of these reforms through this Parliament at some time in the next two years, whenever the then Prime Minister&mdash;whoever it might happen to be&mdash;is game enough to call an election. Once that is held the result is inevitable, and we will introduce the sort of industrial relations reform that is necessary to get this country going again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party cannot cling to the nostalgic and antiquated days of the old union dominance, of compulsion, of draconian mergers of unions into mega-unions and of further concentrating industrial power in the hands of a few treasured mates in the ACTU. Nothing the Government can do will arrest the increasing irrelevance of the union movement in this country. People, workers, are voting with their feet. They are leaving the unions in droves because the unions are not performing the service they were formed to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions have an important role in industrial relations in the 1990s, but the priorities, like those in any organisation to which one chooses to belong, must be to provide members with value for their money. If members are not willing to join a super union which they think is out of touch with what is happening on the shop floor, quite frankly, the union does not deserve to exist. Only those organisations which make it worthwhile to belong, those which provide value in return for union dues rather than leaching money to support the Labor Party without the consent of individual members, will survive, and only they deserve to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Crane will spend some time talking on industrial relations issues. In the last couple of minutes available to me I want to raise briefly a couple of issues. I  have already mentioned in the Senate, as have many of my colleagues, the dangers with the Government's forced amalgamation of unions with less than 10,000 members. I refer again to the contribution of the Democrats, who showed spectacular hypocrisy in supporting the move to increase the size of unions to 10,000 last year, having in September 1988 opposed a Government proposal to introduce a requirement for unions to have a minimum of 3,000 members. The amazing and spectacular hypocrisy is there. In 1986, former Senator Siddons, the Democrat from Victoria, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Union amalgamation as a fundamental industrial relations reform is out.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Democrats said then. Of course, they turn around and now agree with the Government on that 10,000-member move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been warning of the orchestrated campaign by the Government, Kelty and Ferguson to further concentrate industrial power into fewer and more out of touch hands. Whilst the debate on this Government's snail's pace reform has raged, Senator Collins has spoken about the supposed steps forward in the reform of the waterfront. He promised to resign if those reforms were not up to a certain standard; they were not up to that standard but he did not resign, unlike Mr Gary Punch who at least had the honesty to comply with his promise to resign if he could not get his way on the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those union amalgamations are very difficult. Wherever one goes throughout the country&mdash;for example, in the sugar industry in north Queensland where I come from&mdash;the industrial relations policy of the Government is in absolute shambles and in a turmoil. We must get together with the sorts of policies that the Liberal and National parties are proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly speaking, we support the legislation before the Parliament. We urge the Government and the Democrats to support the second reading amendment I have moved, and implement the policies of the Liberal and National parties now so that they can go ahead at this time instead of having to wait for a couple of years until we attain government. It would be good for Australia if the Government were prepared to swallow its pride and do the right thing in the industrial relations field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again refer the Government to the magnificent program&mdash;the vision for the future&mdash;the Fightback program that Dr Hewson has proposed. It will find in it the coalition's blueprint for industrial relations reforms that I have been talking about. In the industrial relations field this package is very well regarded and has been very well received. It will be magnificent for Australia. It is the same as every other part of the Fightback package: it is a marvellous vision and blueprint for Australia. I hope the Government will swallow its pride and copy it at this stage to get us out of this particular mess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is little point in doing as Senator Macdonald did and simply rehearsing the second reading speech of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) by running through what the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 actually does. It is an omnibus Bill which seeks to amend in relatively trivial ways quite a large number of pieces of legislation. I do not intend to rehearse what it does in any detail because that has been done by the Minister and it has been reiterated by the previous speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in picking up some of the remarks which Senator Macdonald has made, I find it interesting that the Opposition is still smarting after the passage of the legislation in relation to political advertising last week. It is still harking back to the idea that it wishes as far as possible to encourage its rich mates to provide very substantial donations to the Party so that it can buy as much deceptive advertising as it possibly can to sell its particular package. The Opposition is objecting very strongly to the democratisation of the process wherein the allocation of time on that very powerful medium is determined by some objective, democratic measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only reflect for a moment on the notice of motion given by Senator Kernot this morning and Richard Farmer's remarks in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> two days ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pick up the point which Senator Macdonald raised in relation to industrial relations. Essentially, that was the point which Mr Howard picked up in the House of Representatives when this Bill was debated there. As Senator Macdonald has said, he wishes to move, as does his Party, to a situation in which employees and potential employees directly negotiate with an employer&mdash;a much more powerful person or organisation&mdash;on a contractual basis, without the intrusion of any protective mechanism such as an industrial relations tribunal. With respect to the democracy of this situation, the Democrats will strongly defend the rights of the weak against the very powerful. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to what Senator Macdonald said in a more substantive way and to what Mr Howard said in the House of Representatives in relation to this legislation. Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition does not intend to oppose any of the specific amendments before the Parliament . . . However, as each of the amendments deals directly with industrial relations matters touching upon the employment of Commonwealth Government public servants, it is opportune for the Opposition to make a number of wide ranging remarks about industrial relations matters generally and, most particularly, industrial relations policy in so far as it affects the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to pick up that point very briefly with respect to one particular amendment which this omnibus Bill addresses, that is, in relation to the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973. When a woman takes maternity leave, this proposed subsection provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An office occupied by a woman must not be declared vacant under subsection (1) unless the woman has given her written consent to the declaration.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment brings the arrangement for the `unattachment' of officers on unpaid maternity leave into line with arrangements applying to other forms of leave without pay and removes a perceived form of discrimination as staff on other forms of leave without pay cannot be declared unattached unless the period of leave exceeds 12 months. This is something Senator Macdonald said, in passing, that he agrees with; of course, so do we. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Picking up on the generality of Senator Macdonald's remarks&mdash;the context in which his remarks were couched&mdash;I observe that the Opposition has been attempting repeatedly to reduce the conditions of employment in this country, specifically in the Public Service, and attempting in a very misleading way to convey the impression that public servants in other countries have lesser conditions than they do in Australia. As a consequence, Australia is struggling and is in difficult financial and trade circumstances precisely because of those pay and conditions, and the way out of that situation for this country is to reduce those conditions for public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply make the point that if one looks at a country such as Sweden one finds that not only would these maternity leave conditions apply but far more generous conditions apply. Not only is maternity leave granted but also paternity leave is granted. It can be extended to both parents to care for children. The periods involved are more extensive than the periods in this country. The conditions which apply are more generous. Yet Sweden is doing convincingly better economically than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go through a number of the other amendments which this legislation makes and show not only that these amendments are fair but also, in terms of the objections which the Opposition has to the conditions of Public Service employment and its general argument that those conditions need to be reduced to improve the economic performance of Australia, that the Opposition is simply not looking at the real facts in other countries. I simply used maternity leave as one example. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 gives effect to a number of amendments falling within the administration of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I wish to comment on the very misleading speech that has just been made by Senator Coulter. The honourable senator particularly mentioned the word `democracy'. He said that the Opposition was not interested in democracy. Our position on industrial relations&mdash;and I want to make this quite clear&mdash;is to make the system more democratic, to give freedom of choice, to give the option of staying in the existing system or moving out. That is what democracy is about &mdash;it is about freedom. It is absolute nonsensical rubbish for Senator Coulter to come in here and make those sorts of comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just let me pick up another point in relation to mega-unions. There is no doubt that the only reason the Government's legislation, albeit amended, to allow the formation of mega-unions was passed in this place was that the Democrats laid down and did another one of their deals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one point in relation to the ad ban legislation. Unfortunately, I was not here for the debate last week but, as I understand it, as a result of that legislation the Democrats will increase their air time to some 10 per cent of the total time. Yet smaller parties or individuals&mdash;which the Democrats claim to protect&mdash;will have no rights in terms of access. So it is quite nonsensical for Senator Coulter to come in here and run that type of argument. I find it disappointing that a thing such as the ad ban, on which so much time was spent last week, has been introduced into this debate because it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Bill that is now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This omnibus Bill deals with legislation administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister. It makes a number of amendments to existing legislation which impact on industrial relations. I wish to comment on some of these and on industrial relations matters generally. This legislation contains a number of industrial relations matters which relate to the employment of Commonwealth public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter relates to the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act. The amendment to this Act ensures that a woman taking leave under the Act cannot be declared `unattached' without her consent in writing. This proposed amendment is intended to bring the detachment provisions applying to maternity leave into line with the detachment provisions for other forms of leave without pay.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff on other forms of leave without pay cannot be declared unattached before the expiration of a period of 12 months. It is the view of the Opposition that provisions of this kind should, along with a lot of other provisions, be dealt with by the workplace bargaining principles that we will bring to bear on the Commonwealth Public Service. That will mean more flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendments relate to the Public Service Act 1922. They implement the restructuring of the Senior Executive Service into three bands. They increase the flexibility of existing SES arrangements by devolving greater responsibility for deploying SES officers to heads of departments and agencies and simplifying existing procedures for deployment. The Opposition has no objection to any of these amendments. In fact, we have promoted them and we have promoted beyond them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the changes the Government has made to the Public Service will inject a lot more flexibility into the system. It will be a better system. Unfortunately these and other amendments contained in this Bill, while increasing flexibility, still remain covered by the Government's general industrial relations arrangements, so the increased flexibility is less than it might otherwise have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there has been increased flexibility in the area of industrial relations due to the changes that have been made in recent times. The most recent decision by the Industrial Relations Commission, which was a total turnaround from the position in April, is an improvement. However, it is indeed a very small step towards true workplace bargaining. While the Commission, the unions and employer organisations continue to have a compulsory position set in legislation, we will not get the full benefits and the increases in productivity, profitability and take home pay that a fully flexible system would bring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth commenting briefly on the situation of the Industrial Relations Commission, the unions and the employers, particularly in light of Senator Coulter's claims relating to our position on democracy. Allowing the system to be more flexible, to be freed up further, is an improvement on democracy, not what Senator Coulter claims. As I have already said, the system now is better than it was 12 months ago and this has been spelt out quite clearly by the shadow Minister, Mr John Howard. However, it still falls a long way short of what could be achieved if the Opposition's policies were adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government must stand condemned for continually misrepresenting the Opposition's industrial relations policy. Our position is clear. We will amend the Act to allow employers and employees, if they so choose&mdash;and I emphasise those words&mdash;to move out of the current system and negotiate their own workplace agreements. In other words, if they choose to stay in, they may stay in; that will be their right. They will have the right to choose whether they wish to belong to a trade union or an employer organisation, or seek the advice of a consultant, or do the negotiating themselves. That is called freedom of choice. It does not mean the demise of the trade union movement or employer organisations. It could well mean that both unions and employer organisations have to lift their game, but that is a different matter. Employers and employees will have the fundamental right to decide who they wish to have represent them&mdash;if anyone&mdash;or to represent themselves, whether or not they stay within the existing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great myth which is continually peddled by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) that we will disband the Industrial Relations Commission is just not true. The other myth, that the Opposition will shut out trade unions, is equally false. We will allow individuals to choose whether they wish to belong to a trade union. In other words, we will bring an end to closed shops or what is commonly known as `no ticket, no job'. One thing that must be clearly understood is that, as well as the right to associate and form an association or organisation or a union, there must also be the right in a free society not to associate. In other words, free men and women in this country should not be forced, by the effect of a loaded, unfair law, to deal through a body for which they have no time or respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only a matter of time before our policy is introduced. People in the workplace will demand it. The employers will demand it. In fact, it is already happening in many workplaces. I would like to highlight a case in Western Australia where a relatively small operation employed 43 people. As a result of the recession and decisions that were made by the Arbitration Commission, the management of that business had no choice but to negotiate with its employees and put off approximately 20 per cent of them&mdash;eight of the 43&mdash;and reduce its staff to 35. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They met and discussed the whole issue. In the final analysis&mdash;and this has not hit the headlines, so I am not naming the people involved&mdash;they decided to take pay cuts ranging from 10 per cent to 15 per cent and keep their jobs. There was a 15 per cent cut at the highest level of employment and for management, and a 10 per cent cut for the lowest paid. That was a joint agreement. When management was approached by the union, it said to the union, `You can now nominate those eight people who are going to lose their jobs'. The union did not want to know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying about our policy position is that it is happening now. That has not disadvantaged anyone in the sense of being able to keep their jobs. It has not disadvantaged the company in the sense that it restricted its operations. It has meant that that company is now in a position to keep all those people in employment, to stay in business and, when the recovery comes&mdash;which it surely will when we get into government&mdash;that company will be in a position to expand and continue to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make about our industrial relations policy versus the Government's position, albeit one that has improved from what it was 12 months ago, is the position that exists at Kambalda in Western Australia. It is on the public record that, in the initial negotiations between Western Mining and its employees, they were quite happy and prepared to reach an agreement to shift to full rostered working seven days a week. It was only when the union got involved that those arrangements fell over. I should also add the State Government because the Deputy Premier of Western Australia is also guilty of letting that arrangement fall over. The impact is that about 100 jobs have been lost and the investment of $106m has gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked to address further points on industrial relations, but I conclude by saying that there is no doubt that the position we have adopted will happen. It will happen because it is necessary for Australia. It is totally irrelevant for Senator Coulter to compare the situation in Australia with that in Sweden, just as it would be irrelevant for the Swedes to compare their situation with the Australian situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving to allow the system to be freed up. We will be giving freedom of choice to individuals as to whether they stay in the existing system or whether they move out and negotiate. We will give them the freedom of choice as to whether they utilise the services of an employer organisation or a union to negotiate for them, or whether they choose to do it themselves. It will, in fact, improve the position of democracy in industrial relations in this country. It will lead to increases in productivity, it will lead to more profitability of companies and it will lead to greater take-home pay for the individuals involved. </PARA>

That, of course, is as it absolutely should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Norfolk Island has a unique history and a special relationship with Australia as possibly Australia's most historic territory. Its approximately 2,000 residents are a rare blend of Pitcairners, Australians and New Zealanders and about 25 per cent are temporary residents. Self-government came to the island in 1979 and the island is well run and happily so. The coalition believes that present arrangements should continue and, therefore, it is only right that the Resource Assessment Commission's powers be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that position, I find it inconsistent that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, the Hon. David Simmons, now proposes that Norfolk Islanders be compulsorily accumulated into the Federal electorate of Canberra. The Federal Government claims it is responding to a House of Representatives report which suggests that the option of voting in Federal elections be extended to Australian residents on Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always very convenient for a government to say it is following the wishes of a committee, but just as frequently, if not more so, committee reports are ignored. No better example can be given than that of the report of the Standing Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. Not only has the Government not done anything about the recommendations in that report, it has not even bothered to respond to the Senate, despite the fact that industry is screaming for it to do so. So much for suggesting that the Minister is only following the advice of a committee report. It is rather inconsistent of the Government, on the one hand, not even to reply to a report and, on the other hand, to say it is only responding to advice in a completely different type of report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That same committee report suggested optional voting, but in February 1991 a referendum amongst Norfolk Islanders specifically rejected the notion of Federal representation, and not for the first time. They have since rejected it again. The feeling among Norfolk Islanders against any form of integration with Australia is historically very strong. In fact, in the referendum held the other day, 80-odd per cent voted against any compulsory voting by Australians in specific electorates. That has not deterred the Minister from suggesting only yesterday that he was going to Norfolk Island not to discuss the issue but to tell the Islanders that they will be included in the electorate of Canberra. I do not know whether that is giving people a say. I suggest it is actually being heavy-handed. The coalition would not and does not agree with such high-handed approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it somewhat inconsistent that the Federal Government can, in dealing with resource assessment, acknowledge the independence of Norfolk Island, while on something as basic as a right to vote, assume a colonial, paternalistic approach which is entirely inappropriate for the 1990s.

I believe it has a right to expect in its self-government a degree of respect, which I do not believe this Government is giving those people on Norfolk Island. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At some stage I would like to speak at length on the subject matter of the amendment to the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, but on this occasion I will speak shortly because of the time constraints that are upon us to get through a whole bunch of legislation before Christmas. In respect of the amendment that has just been read out by Senator Brownhill, I make a couple of comments. The amendment asks the Senate to deplore the Government's failure to acknowledge Commonwealth employees' freedom to associate, and its failure to capture the productivity improvements to be had from enterprise bargaining within the Public Service by proscribing compulsory membership of trade unions. I have not heard anything said today during the debate which would suggest that there is compulsory trade unionism in the Public Service. If somebody can point out to me where there is compulsory membership of trade unions in the Public Service, then I will support the amendment because I, together with I believe an overwhelming number of members of trade unions and of trade unions themselves, am against compulsory membership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have fought, both as an official of an individual union registered under the Industrial Relations Act and as Secretary-General of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council in my previous existence, for the rights of a person who has a genuine conscientious objection to becoming a member of a trade union not to do so. I have stood up for this in debate and arguments, and eventually I have made sure that in areas for which I am responsible this is made known by organisers to persons who are likely to be invited to join trade unions. I have insisted on that on every occasion I have had the opportunity of so doing to protect those rights of individuals to the freedom of their conscience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment then goes on to suggest that we ought to support proscribing preference for trade unionists in awards and Federal legislation. As I understand it, advancement to higher grades in the Public Service is by merit, and a number of other matters which come into it as well. I have not heard anything in this debate which would suggest that it is otherwise. I am not sure what this means. I wish to make it clear to the chamber that it is important that there be truly representative trade unions; it is important that industrial relations legislation and various awards reflect that. It is important because, if unions and associations which are registered under the provisions of the industrial relations legislation and other legislation, including State legislation, are not properly representative of the employees of particular undertakings governed by those awards, the whole system is likely to fall down. Are those opposite then going to say that individual employees will have to fight it out with their bosses, with the chief executives of their departments, for their salaries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the last point of the amendment, which is to give the chief executive officers of Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities the same responsibility as their private sector counterparts in deciding the size, composition, deployment, pay and conditions of employees, subject only to a Budget constraint. Where will the Public Service go in that situation? There will be differential rates of pay for people in a given Public Service department. For example, if somebody moves from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, working side by side with somebody at the same level and doing a similar job, the person who has come from another department could well be receiving different pay and conditions. Presumably, that individual would have to negotiate both pay and conditions with the chief executive officer of the Commonwealth department or statutory authority or their delegates. Really, as a result of that, there would be a shemozzle in the Public Service. I really have not heard a properly argued case for what we are asked to vote for here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of employees' freedom to associate, I suggest when the real debate takes place on this question of freedom of association that those who are interested in the matter should have a look at the history of the development of that particular right. They should perhaps go back to some of the material that was presented to the Industrial Relations Legislation Committee, of which I happened to be the Chairman. There were some very interesting comments made at that stage. It is not only in the transcript but also in the submissions. There were some very interesting submissions made by people who uphold and support the principle that no individual should be compulsorily bound against their conscientious wish and be forced to join a union. That to me is anathema, and it was to those people who made those submissions, yet they have a well-argued case in respect of the importance of trade unions and the importance of encouraging people to play their part and, might I say, pay their part for the work that is done by the registered industrial organisations which obtain the employment pay and conditions under which those employees work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, and not least for the problems that will be caused in the Public Service and the efficiency of the Public Service if we adopt paragraph (d) of the Opposition's proposed amendment, I am opposed to that amendment. But I make it perfectly clear why I am opposed to it, and that should be understood by the Senate as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, a portfolio Bill from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This Bill amends several Acts under the aegis of that Department and, as Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service matters, it comes to me to carry this legislation through the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Acts that are amended by this Bill are the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, the Governor-General Act 1974, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986, the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973, the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984, the Ombudsman Act 1976, the Public Service Act 1922, the Public Service Reform Act 1984, the statutory authority legislation and the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While all of those are quite significant and important Acts of this Parliament, the amendments that are being made can be characterised fairly as important and significant amendments in their own right but not substantial changes to the fundamentals of any of those Acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The global effect of these amendments is to make some changes within the application of those Acts to bring them up to date with standards that need to be applied in the Public Service and/or to make some other operational changes to those Acts. While this Bill has a comprehensive scope in terms of the number of Acts that it deals with, it is not hugely significant legislation; it is more catching-up-and-improving legislation, gardening legislation to remove the weeds, improve the growth and let the existing legislation get on with itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has indicated that it does not oppose any of these amendments. The Australian Democrats have expressed support for the legislation more positively than the Opposition. The Opposition indicated its position by saying that it does not oppose this Bill, which I guess means that it will vote for it; the Democrats said that they support the Bill, which clearly means that they will vote for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to this Bill, moved at the second reading stage by Senator Macdonald on behalf of the Opposition, has occupied the time of this chamber. This is in similar terms to an amendment moved in the House of Representatives by the shadow Minister for industrial relations, Mr Howard, which was defeated. It is an amendment that refers to industrial relations. While industrial relations is not directly dealt with in any of these amendments, some of the amendments have an effect of improving the industrial relations climate in the Public Service, so the Opposition has taken this opportunity to stage a debate of very indifferent quality on industrial relations. Others may say that Opposition senators took the opportunity to simply parade their prejudices about industrial relations to make some fairly obscure points. Therefore, I think there is an obligation on me, in replying to this debate, to deal, albeit briefly, with some of the matters put by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot characterise a debate on industrial relations simply in terms of what the Opposition has tried to do&mdash;that is, engage purely, simply, blatantly and nakedly in a union-bashing exercise. Industrial relations is more than that, and that is not a serious debate under the industrial relations heading. I will deal with the Opposition's narrow and prejudicial view of this field from the points it has raised. The starting point is obviously the Opposition's own amendment, which is instructive. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but the Senate deplores the Government's failure to acknowledge Commonwealth employees' freedom to associate. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The words `freedom to associate' have a precise and defined legal meaning in the field of industrial relations. Here it is not used in its precise or defined meaning; it is used as a public relations phrase to make it appear that something is when in fact something is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defined legal meaning of `freedom of association' is the right of individuals to freely associate in trade unions. Convention 87, the Convention on the Freedom of Association, of the International Labour Organisation, the United Nations industrial relations agency, sets minimum labour standards for the world. The meaning of `freedom of association' is thereby defined within the United Nations framework for our consumption. It is not what the Opposition is now talking about. It is a right of trade unions to exist and a right of individual workers to join them. It is not, as the Opposition is proposing in this amendment, that trade unions should be dismantled and divided and that the right of so-called independent contracts undermine a recognised system of awards that prescribes minimum rates of pay. The use of language in the first part of the Opposition's amendment illustrates an attempt to make something appear different from that which it is with no respect for legal meaning. The amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and the Government's failure to capture the productivity improvements to be had from enterprise bargaining within the federal Public Service by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)proscribing compulsory membership of trade unions;</PARA>
<PARA>From the Opposition's amendment, the casual observer would comprehend that there is compulsory membership of trade unions in the Australian Public Service. That is the implication, but there is not. The Commonwealth does not insist on members of the Australian Public Service being members of trade unions. That is not clear from this amendment, which sets up a belief and demolishes it as if it were true and as if this amendment, if it were carried, would do something. All it would do is support exactly what happens. There is no compulsory membership of trade unions forced on employees of the Commonwealth Public Service by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government insists that the principle of merit govern employment within the Australian Public Service, including the rights of transfer and promotion for its own work force, which is extensive and numerous in this country. It is for individuals within the Australian Public Service to decide for themselves whether to join a union. Their applications for employment, transfer or promotion will be dealt with not on the basis of whether they are a member of a union but on the basis of the merits of their particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was no better or more clearly set out than in the second reading speech on the Public Service Legislation (Streamlining) Bill in 1986, when the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service Matters said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill strengthens and extends the existing prohibition on patronage, favouritism and discrimination. Section 33 of the Act will state categorically that powers are to be exercised without patronage, favouritism or discrimination. The disciplinary provisions will be amended to make express reference to the fact that patronage, favouritism or discrimination amount to misconduct and render officers liable to disciplinary action.</PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of the passage of that Bill, principles were brought into play which, in effect, provide that all eligible persons must have a reasonable opportunity to apply for any position; appointment must be made on the basis of an assessment of the relative suitability of the applicants; powers in relation to appointment, transfer or promotion shall be exercised without patronage or favouritism; discrimination is precluded on the grounds of political affiliation, race, colour, ethnic origin, social origin, religion, sex, sexual preference, marital status, pregnancy, age or physical or mental disability; and discrimination that is unlawful under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 or the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, or any other unjustified discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, under the auspices of this Government, the merit principle sits as the foundation stone for the activities of public servants in this country. For the Opposition to propose and infer in its amendment that that is not the case does not reflect on us but reflects very sadly on the Opposition's competence or efforts to try to gull the Australian community into believing that something other than what is the case operates in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant commentary that came through the second reading contributions of a number of senators was the point that the Public Service needs to be made more flexible to take advantage of the options for enterprise negotiations. These remarks were made by Senator Macdonald and echoed, in his own way, by Senator Crane. Certainly Senator Harradine made some very pertinent observations about the direction of policy implementation, based on the remarks of Senators Macdonald and Crane. I think the remarks by Senator Harradine in this debate are apposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background that I will now give will disprove essentially the contention made by the Opposition, assuage to some extent, although not completely, the concerns voiced by Senator Harradine and perhaps explain to the community what is in fact the case. Once again, if one looks at what is, rather than what is alleged, one can see that what is, in fact, is a balanced and responsible approach by a government managing its public sector with a great deal of success&mdash;success not only on the basis of the quality of the services provided but also on the basis of the economic cost of those services and the job satisfaction of the public servants involved in providing those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The April national wage case resulted in a decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to award a 2.5 per cent wage increase, among other things, upon application by unions. As a result of that wage case, the Government entered into negotiations with public sector unions for accord mark VI changes and reached an agreement that the basis for wage improvements over the 2.5 per cent would be productivity changes. That raised squarely and centre stage: how then do we in a public service calculate what is the level of productivity change, what are the factors that cause it, and how best are the rewards that are generated by it to be distributed to those who have had a hand in doing so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity is not a matter of people simply working harder. It is also a matter of what capital investment has been made in the Public Service, particularly in the computerisation of services, in order to provide more and efficient services. It is a matter of capital investment as well as work practices. Indeed, if one is to examine both elements, the capital investment one is by far and away the most significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the agreements reached with the public sector unions and the commitment to a form of productivity bargaining in the public sector, the Government set up a committee of senior public servants, all of them Secretaries or heads of their own departments or agencies, chaired by the Secretary of my Department, the Department of Industrial Relations. The membership of the committee includes the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the head of the Department of Finance, the head of the Department of the Treasury and a number of other departmental heads, including the head of the Department of Social Security. The question of, `How can you generate productivity measurements as a basis for productivity wage negotiations?', has been under examination by this committee. It has produced an interim report which is publicly available for discussion and debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that no Opposition spokesperson has made any contribution at all in response to the report that has been published on this subject&mdash;certainly not the shadow spokesman, Mr Howard, who is very vociferous in his comments elsewhere. But having been confronted with an absolute report dealing with the subjects that he struts the public stage pontificating about, has he responded?  No, of course he has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the Government has appointed a group of professors of economics and industrial relations from the University of Newcastle, the University of New South Wales and the University of Cambridge in Great Britain to provide a second report. This is, if you like, a report from outside the Public Service; a report from people with an objective point of view and with an academic background which can be held against the report of the senior bureaucrats. On the basis of that, there can be more informed government decision making. Those professors are Professor Barry Hughes, a professor of economics at the University of Newcastle; Professor John Niland, Dean of the Faculty of Commerce and Economics at the University of New South Wales; and Professor Willie Brown, a professor of industrial relations at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom. Their report has been lodged in the last few days. The Cabinet will take the recommendations of both the bureaucrats and the professors and consider how, in the light of those reports, productivity matters can be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contrast a procedure as considered as that, as informed as that and as involved as that, with the simple assertion that, `We should do something; we should do something to just simply decentralise'. It is not a matter of just making assertions like that; it is a matter of government taking responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very serious questions involved here and Senator Harradine referred to some of them. Let me cite one of those questions. The Australian Public Service is based on the model of the public service in Britain. It is a public service with a tradition of fearless advice, irrespective of who is in government. It is a public service with salary scales and promotional levels similar right across the board, irrespective of which department one is employed in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's amendment proposes that all of the agencies and departments be broken up and the career and traditional nature of the Public Service be changed to one in which each department or agency is an individual enterprise, each secretary is a chief executive and each employee in that department is simply a worker to be treated under the terms and conditions of whatever is the objective of that department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first problem with that is that it destroys the fundamental nature of the Public Service as it stands now and changes the levels of remuneration most likely between agencies or departments&mdash;so promotion across the Public Service is set aside. The second problem with that is that some sections of the Public Service do have scope for high productivity increase. I refer here to the service provider sections such as the Department of Social Security, the Australian Taxation Office and the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Areas of the Public Service that provide services to the community&mdash;such as DSS, the Tax Office and CES&mdash;can find ways within their so-called enterprise to be more productive, and that is a good thing if they can. But what about the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, for example&mdash;the Department which is the subject of the legislation that is now before us&mdash;which essentially offers policy advice?  What about the Department of the Treasury which is essentially monitoring international economic conditions, Australian economic conditions, and advising on policy related to those conditions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Michael Tate, is in the chamber. He is the Minister with responsibility for the Attorney-General's Department, where legal opinions are obtained. How do we require lawyers to put out more legal opinions in a day for the same amount of money in order to create productivity? I note for the record that Senator Harradine is shaking his head at this point, as if to indicate that we cannot. If that is his indication, I agree with him. How then, in the service providing departments where there is scope for some productivity change, do we match that with the intellectual activity of advice giving in the advice providing departments? That is, at core, one of the central dilemmas of this situation. The Opposition's motion does not address that issue at all. It simply says that we should go down its route, irrespective of the evidence, complications or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few minutes of the time I wish to spend on this subject, I turn to what is, in essence, the absolute and  fundamental divide between the conservative side of politics in this country and the non-conservative side of politics. On the non-conservative side, I include, in that wide embrace, the Australian Democrats, who have spoken on this Bill with some force. The basic difference that divides the Opposition and the Government&mdash;or the conservatives and the non-conservatives&mdash;is that the Government is committed to a form of industrial relations which promotes cooperation in the Australian workplace and the Opposition is committed to a form of industrial relations which promotes conflict. There can be no more neatly defined difference: it is a choice between cooperation and conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wish to work with the institutions that exist in the field of industrial relations for the purpose of achieving reform. The Opposition wishes to confront those institutions, undermine them or weaken them for the purpose of achieving a computer-driven policy objective. We recognise and give responsibility to trade unions to play their role along with the other institutions in Australian society; whereas the Opposition wishes to exclude, isolate, attack and scapegoat trade unions as though they were the absolute evil of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fundamental terms, that is the great divide. I believe Australians will support the cooperative approach. Indeed, if results account for anything, in the period of the Hawke Government compared with the period of the Fraser Government, industrial disputes in this country have reduced by some 60 per cent. That is one of the best examples of the difference between the Fraser Government's form and our form; it is an example of greater cooperation. Because we have accentuated the cooperative model, we now find that increasingly in Australian industry employees and employers are getting together. The old boss-worker divide&mdash;which is a feature of the conflict model&mdash;no longer applies with the same degree of force as it did in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find employers and workers getting together to set jointly the productive targets for their companies, working out how best to share fairly the rewards of success between them, and then going about creating a more productive company atmosphere. That is true of a whole range of companies&mdash;many of them leading companies in this country. That is a reason why we are now on the threshold of a surge in productivity in Australia, which has been brought about by the achievements of award restructuring, award modernisation, career pathing for workers in industry and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in essence, we seek a means of empowering individuals in the workplace, through their legitimately recognised organisations, to respect and have regard for the ideas that they can put forward. We respect their role; we do not simply see them as units of production to be commanded and controlled and to have to be forced into a situation of one against the bureaucracy, as though one individual negotiating with the bureaucracy of a company or the bureaucracy of a government is a fair bargaining basis. That is the difference and the fundamental divide. That is, essentially, why I do not accept the Opposition's view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane and Senator Macdonald insisted upon making a couple of points about industrial relations. The first point Senator Macdonald made&mdash;which is a foundational concept of the Opposition&mdash;involved the freedom of employers and employees to enter into direct contracts. That sounds lovely, benign and reasonable. But that is not lovely, it is not benign and it is unreasonable. It is a glib phrase, and, in its glibness, it means that the umpire&mdash;in this case the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;whose job it is to ensure fair play and reasonable conduct in industrial relations, is taken out of the equation. So the players on the field have no umpire to guarantee that the parties play by the rules and that they are fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also means that the awards in this country &mdash;which are awards of the Commission, determined by the umpire in this case, and which, by and large, set minimum standards for industry sectors&mdash;are to be subverted and undermined. The effect of not being able to contract out of an award is fundamental, but that is to be undermined. So minimum protections are to be taken away; minimum protections which guarantee fair labour standards are to be removed. The umpire goes, the minimum standards go and, on that basis, we are then left with only the union structure in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one turns to page 2 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of last Thursday, one can see in the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) that it is his intention to destroy those organisations. That is a transitional cost of the achievement of the consumption tax package that he has put forward. The umpire goes, the minimum protections go and the trade unions are destroyed. The Opposition then achieves the objective of freedom for employers and employees to enter into direct contracts. If that is not a recipe for exploitation, then one has never been put forward in the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have dealt with the second of the three points made by Senator Macdonald: the freedom to choose to belong or not to belong to a union, which is fundamental to what applies in the Commonwealth Public Service. I conclude by dealing with the third point: that unions should be brought within the bounds of the law. In many respects, this is the greatest insult to the Australian mind because unions operate within the bounds of law. If they do not they can be dealt with under that law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions, by and large, are registered with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The right of that registration confers benefits and privileges, but obligations and responsibilities as well. One ought to look to see what those obligations and responsibilities are. They are obligations about free and democratic elections to ensure that the leadership of those organisations is elected properly; they are obligations about reporting the financial concerns of unions to ensure that the funds are not mismanaged; and they are obligations about how one should participate in the industrial process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when the Opposition talks about the law, it talks about contract law or criminal law. It does not recognise that in this country, as in every civilised and developed country in the world, there are different provinces of law. Criminal law is a particular province, company law is a particular province, family law is a particular province, administrative law is a particular province, and so is industrial law. Industrial law is on the statute books of this country perforce of a provision in the Constitution which enables it to be put there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition wants to bring the common law into the province of industrial law and set aside the constitutional right of governments in this country to write law, under the Constitution, in the field of industrial relations. That is what those opposite are talking about. It is vastly different from this innocent, so-called reasonable proposition about the force of the common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reasonable labour standards in the world&mdash;as set down by the United Nations agency, the ILO; the Australian Constitution; and statute law in industrial relations&mdash;require the observance of those laws and the respect for minimum standards. By setting aside that law, the Opposition wishes to undermine those minimum standards and drive down wages in Australia, as though making this country a low wage country and turning us into the Taiwan of the South Pacific is somehow or other a recipe for economic reform.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1991 makes four amendments in relation to the National Crime Authority Act 1984. First, new section 29A provides that, where a member of the NCA summons a witness to give oral evidence or issues a notice requiring the production of documents, the summons or notice may include a notation prohibiting the disclosure of certain information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New section 29B provides for penalties for disclosure under circumstances where disclosure may be allowed, for example, in seeking legal advice. This amendment is proposed because it has happened in the past that persons or institutions served with a summons or notice have disclosed the existence of that summons or notice and information relating to the NCA's investigations. There are attendant risks of jeopardising investigations and damaging reputations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment proposed in this Bill is to section 31, which provides for a member of the NCA to apply to a court to obtain a warrant of apprehension where a person has or is likely to abscond or is otherwise likely to attempt to evade service of a summons. It does not currently provide for a warrant application in relation to a person who fails or refuses to appear in response to a summons. The amendment proposed corrects that anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, section 50 of the NCA Act is amended to allow the Chairman of the NCA, instead of the Attorney-General, to appoint counsel to assist the Authority. The Opposition is of the view that this is reasonable since it would normally be the Chairman who is in the best position to assess the need to appoint counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, pursuant to amendments to section 59, the NCA will be authorised to provide reports at the request of a State or Territory Minister, who is a member of the NCA's inter-governmental committee, to that Minister about the NCA's investigations within that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose these amendments, although we do have some concerns about those relating to non-disclosure notation. Under the proposed new section 29A, a member of the NCA will be able to exercise a discretion to include in a summons or notice a notation prohibiting the disclosure of certain information where the failure to do so might prejudice a person's reputation or safety, the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence or the effectiveness of an investigation, or might otherwise be contrary to public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition basically agrees with this proposal and the underlying aim, which is to make the NCA more open and accountable. However, I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment on behalf of the Opposition with the intention of strengthening this provision. It is our view that the NCA should further be obliged to include a non-disclosure notation where failure to do so would reasonably be expected to prejudice the safety or reputation of the person, the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence or the effectiveness of an investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also foreshadow a further amendment to ensure that, where a member of the NCA includes in a summons or notice a non-disclosure notation, he must also provide a written statement setting out the rights and obligations that the person has under proposed section 29B, which sets out the penalties for disclosure and the circumstances in which disclosure may be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention that the amendments I will be moving in the committee stage differ in some respects from those that were moved by my colleague in the other chamber, Mr Wilson, who was then the acting shadow Attorney-General. The differences are a result of discussions between the coalition and the Government. I understand that the amendments in their redrafted form are now acceptable to the Government. In the committee stage I will move those amendments, but otherwise we support the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is discussing the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1991. The main provisions are contained in clause 2 and detail amendments to sections 28 and 29. Proposed section 29A will allow a member of the NCA issuing a summons on notice under sections 28 and 29 to include a notification that disclosure of the information in the document is prohibited except in the circumstances, if any, listed in the notification. The prohibition is to be included only if the member is satisfied that it is necessary to prevent prejudice to the safety or reputation of a person, a fair trial or the effectiveness of an investigation, or a situation contrary to the public interest. The notification will cease to be in force if the investigation is completed and either the evidence has been given or no evidence has been obtained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 29B will make it an offence to breach a section 29A prohibition by the recipient. Disclosure will be allowed only where it is in accordance with the circumstances specified in the notice&mdash;that is, made to a legal practitioner to gain advice; made to officers of a company, if necessary, to allow the company to comply; made by a legal practitioner in accordance with the professional duty to his client; or to obtain agreement to disclose a privileged communication. Where the information has been disclosed to an officer of a company that person may subsequently disclose the information to another officer to ensure compliance or to a legal practitioner to obtain advice. Legal practitioners may also subsequently disclose the information to give assistance in accordance with the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 30 of the principal Act provides that people are guilty of an offence if they fail to attend a hearing when they have been summonsed. Clause 3 of this Bill will amend section 31 of the principal Act, which deals with arrest powers to enable the Authority to apply to a court for a warrant for the arrest of people who have committed such an offence or who are not likely to attend a hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, clause 4 of the Bill will amend section 50 of the Act to provide that the Chairman of the Authority, instead of the Attorney-General, may appoint counsel to assist the Authority. I submit that the delegation of power brought about by clause 4 is an appropriate and reasonable one. The need to appoint legal counsel to assist the Authority is a matter which the Chairman is in the best position to assess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5 of the Bill will amend section 59 of the principal Act to provide that, where a State Minister on the intergovernmental committee requests specific information on the exercise of the NCA's general powers within the Minister's jurisdiction, the NCA must comply with the request. Such requests currently go through the Commonwealth Minister and similar provisions exist in respect of special investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support the thrust of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill. We will also support the Opposition amendments which seek to strengthen it and to put a stronger obligation on the members of the NCA to issue such a notice when certain conditions are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to express appreciation for the work done by Mr Justice Phillips, who is the Chairman of the NCA. He is leaving to be appointed as Chief Justice of Victoria. If I may express my opinion with the utmost respect, I am sure that he will grace that office as much as he has graced the office of Chairman of the NCA. He has introduced new directions which have been much needed and much appreciated. This has moved the Authority towards greater openness and accountability. It has provided for greater sharing of crime intelligence with other law enforcement agencies and lead to a greater level of cooperation with those agencies and to a much more focused use of the quite extraordinary powers that the NCA has and which this Bill is dealing with today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to take the opportunity to comment briefly on the evaluation report of the National Crime Authority which has been tabled by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority. Given the time constraints that are now upon the Senate, I do not expect that the report will be debated this year. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Crichton-Browne" NAMEID="XF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I am wrong, too. However, I wish to put on record briefly that I am in general agreement with the conclusions of the majority report and, in particular, the provisions which seek to make it clear that the Committee must have greater access to information to be able to carry out its statutory duty to supervise the NCA. I note that the Committee has seen fit&mdash;I am grateful for that&mdash;to adopt the exemptions which are included in my private member's Bill which place a duty of confidentiality on members of the Committee. The exemptions are that Committee members may not disclose information which would, firstly, identify persons in a manner which would be prejudicial to the safety or legal rights of those persons; secondly, prejudice legal proceedings whether those proceedings have commenced; and, thirdly, disclose the operational methods of the Authority in a manner prejudicial to the operations of the Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I part company with the majority report where it is not prepared to accept, in the event of a dispute between the NCA and the Committee, that the Attorney-General, the Minister of the day, be empowered to adjudicate such a dispute. I have proposed that it should be a judge of the Federal Court of Australia not sitting as a judge of the court. I believe this removes the political aspect that should not be present in such an adjudication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to put on record that the second option in dealing with the flow of information to the Committee is entirely unacceptable. The majority report suggests that there could be a second option, if the Government so chooses; namely, that the criteria which are currently being used to define the information which the Committee members may not disclose should be used to define which information should not even reach the Committee. Such a provision would stymie the Committee's efforts to supervise the Authority which is its statutory duty, and would be totally unacceptable. I trust that in due course the Government will see fit to ensure that the Parliamentary Committee which was established to deal with individual complaints as well as the general operations of the National Crime Authority is given the powers it needs to carry out its duties competently and efficiently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express support for the general principles of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1991. Clause 2 of the Bill inserts proposed new sections 29A and 29B. Where the Authority summonses witnesses to give oral evidence or issues a notice requiring the production of documents, a member of the Authority will be given discretionary powers to include in a summons or a notice a notation prohibiting disclosure of certain information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is done for two reasons: firstly, to prevent what is described as a tip off; that is, to prevent disclosure to someone who may well be under investigation from having access to that knowledge and, therefore, perhaps destroying the evidence or so arranging his affairs as to prevent a proper and exhaustive investigation, and also in the event that it was likely to prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or `the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence', as the amendment says. To the extent that the proposition goes that far, we agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment is to clause 3 of the Bill, which amends section 31 of the National Crime Authority Act to enable the Authority to apply to a court to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a person who, having been served with a summons, fails or refuses to appear at a hearing conducted by the Authority. For reasons which are not immediately apparent to me, the Act is limited to the extent that the Authority can presently have a recalcitrant witness either gaoled or fined. That in no way goes towards attaining the information that the Authority would want. This amendment requires by summons the appearance of a reluctant witness at a hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, clause 4 of the Bill amends section 50 of the Act to provide that the Chairman of the Authority, rather than the Attorney-General, as presently applies, appoint counsel to assist the Authority. Everybody would agree that the person best able to judge whether counsel is required&mdash;to the extent that counsel is required, and what counsel is required&mdash;is the Chairman of the Authority and not the Attorney-General. Of course, that amendment also has our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, clause 5 of the Bill amends section 59 of the Act which sets out the obligations of the Authority in respect of the reporting of its activities. Presently, for general investigations the reporting of the Authority goes via this complicated, convoluted route to the Federal Attorney-General, to the Inter-Governmental Committee and then to the various State authorities. As I understand it, it is proposed that the same course be taken for general inquiries as is taken for special investigations; that is, they go directly to the various States. Presumably, that will provide for a more effective flow of information and also for greater monitoring of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the thrust of the Bill; however, we have two amendments of our own to which, no doubt, Senator Hill referred. The first is that it makes it an obligation for the Authority to place a prohibition on information in the circumstances set out in the Bill. It may well be that certain circumstances will arise in which it is not necessarily in the interests of the Authority to put a prohibition on disclosure of the serving of the summons and the demand for information. It is our view that it should be mandatory, compulsory and obligatory for the Authority to place the prohibition. We also propose that a notation be accompanied by a written statement setting out the reasons and the rights of the person receiving the summons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, like Senator Spindler, I will take this opportunity to touch on some matters which go to the heart of the National Crime Authority Act and also the very elegant report that was prepared by the Authority, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards:  An Evaluation of the National Crime Authority</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) what the Government's attitude to the secrecy provisions now is, because these matters of concern have been before the Government for some time. Justice Phillips himself has set down his preferred options for disclosure within the confines of section 51. Senator Spindler has introduced a private member's Bill; I have also introduced a private member's Bill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some recommendations in the report as to how they can be dealt with, because the present situation is most unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, by way of qualification, that having the Attorney-General adjudicate is not my preferred option because it simply means that it will be capable of being political because the Attorney-General, of course, is a political animal. There will also be a temptation for the Attorney-General to take the soft option and agree with the National Crime Authority in the event that there is a dispute between the Authority and the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not detect a ground swell of support for Senator Spindler's proposal within our ranks, which was to have a sitting member of the Federal Court adjudicate on disputes. I am essentially of the view that the Parliament cannot have non-parliamentarians adjudicating in those matters, so my own preferred option ultimately was that as the Committee, like all committees, will be thoroughly responsible and accountable to the public, to the Parliament and to its peers, there should be a process where the Committee could be required to seek written advice from a retired member of the Federal Court, that advice to be tabled in the event that it is ignored by the Committee. </PARA>

It is not the disclosure of operational matters or any matters from the NCA to the Committee that are of concern, it is the next point; it is the disclosure of that information advertently or inadvertently, either properly or improperly, through reports to the Parliament or elsewhere, that is of concern. If a member of the Committee, or the Committee as a whole, were of a mind to disclose information in a report, if there had been a recommendation from a retired judge suggesting that the report ought not be made available, I would have thought that would be a sanction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister will be mindful of the fact that there has been a tortuous route taken by this Government with respect to secrecy provisions generally. We have had nonsense opinions from the Solicitor-General and from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) which argue that general secrecy provisions prevail&mdash;prevail, that is, in the face of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The reason we have the Parliamentary Privileges Act, almost as a declaratory piece of legislation, is to put to rest the nonsense arguments that in some way those secrecy provisions placed a prohibition on members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have received a written opinion in respect of the Australian Sports Drug Agency which advised the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that it is unable to disclose the names of athletes who have given a positive sample.

Secondly, we received an opinion in respect of the Health Act, and that opinion has now been reversed. It had arrived at the same conclusion from a different route. Thirdly, we have had a different opinion in respect of the National Crime Authority. These opinions are all nonsense. </PARA>

I would ask the Minister what the Government's position is in respect of secrecy provisions because, frankly, it makes a nonsense of the Committee. The Government itself has referred to the consequences, the effectiveness and the relevance of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who contributed to this debate on the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1991. It is an important Bill. Although its provisions perhaps do not go to the heart of the operations of the Authority, it does mark yet another occasion on which this Parliament, and in particular this Senate, has considered the state of the National Crime Authority in Australian society. It certainly gives me an opportunity to join with members of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in saying that, since Mr Justice Phillips was appointed on 14 August last year, he has transformed not only the operations of the National Crime Authority but also its relationships with both this Parliament&mdash;which, of course, is its creator&mdash;and those other law enforcement agencies throughout Australia with whom he has adopted a much more cooperative stance than was the case with his predecessors.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it is more sensible because it will help achieve the objective of the Authority, which is to ensure that within the Australian law enforcement system there is a repository of those extraordinary powers which are sometimes required in order to investigate organised criminal activity in Australia, and yet it should be done in a way which recognises that other agencies&mdash;whether State police forces, other commissions of a like kind in the States, or arms of other agencies such as Customs&mdash;all have their part to play in tackling the phenomenon of organised crime in Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice Phillips has attempted to work in a very practical and harmonious fashion with those agencies which, by the way, have themselves reached a new stage in maturity which allows that partnership to be forged. In fairness to the first Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Justice Stewart, it must be said that at the time when he assumed office there were well-founded misgivings about the capacity, in simple competence terms, and certainly the probity of even the highest levels of some of the other law enforcement agencies which had been operating in Australia for many years without any significant impact on organised criminal activity in some jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that stage has now been passed in Australian society, thank goodness, and that it is now possible for the National Crime Authority to work more confidently with the State police forces and other law enforcement agencies around Australia. The new role of the National Crime Authority, as a coordinator and as a repository of those extraordinary powers which need to be vested somewhere&mdash;under democratic control of this Parliament&mdash;in the investigation of alleged criminal activity, is certainly proving to be much more relevant and successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thinks, for example, of the allegations that are made from time to time about Italian elements in organised criminal activity in Australia. Late last year there was a conference held which brought together various personnel from Australia and even overseas who could make a very well-informed contribution to the intelligence gathering within Australia of criminal activity with that colouring. On the occasion of the reception being held in association with that conference, I recall with great pleasure meeting Judge Falcone from Italy, who has led the fight against the Mafia in Sicily. I had the honour of meeting him again in Rome some four or five weeks ago. He has taken a very real interest in helping to alert Australian law enforcement authorities on matters of mutual interest in the fight against criminal activity. He is a very brave man indeed. It is that sort of ability demonstrated by Mr Justice Phillips in the newly revamped National Crime Authority, and which brought to bear the best advice and intelligence not only from within Australia but also from overseas in tackling organised crime, which augurs well for the future of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few areas of the Bill require strengthening. It has been found, for example, that some recipients of a summons or notice from the National Crime Authority such as financial institutions were in a quandary. They felt that they had very real obligations to their clients; that they needed to inform their clients of the existence and receipt of the documents. That could have the effect of alerting possible suspects in NCA investigations to the fact of the investigation, allowing them to conceal or destroy evidence or go into hiding. The proposed amendment will help to prevent that happening again and will clarify the legal position of these financial institutions. They wanted to obey the law but were put in a difficult position vis-a-vis their clients. The amendment will help to clarify what Parliament intends in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Opposition will move an amendment to certain provisions in this area. Whereas a member had a discretion to include a notation which could be exercised where he was satisfied that failure to include a notation might prejudice the safety, reputation or fair trial of a person or prejudice the effectiveness and the investigation which was otherwise in the public interest, the Opposition is proposing that where the member is reasonably satisfied that the above matters would be prejudiced he must include the notation. That seems to me to be a sensible amendment and the Government will accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this whole series of amendments, we are concerned with protecting the reputation of suspects at a time when allegations have not been properly investigated. I believe that the potential for damage to the reputation of people, through the disclosure of the existence of a summons or notice, is so significant that we have to make safeguards within the legislation. That is what we are going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe&mdash;I know that I am increasingly in a minority in this respect&mdash;that the National Crime Authority should operate in secret. I am not a believer in the public parading of persons against whom allegations have been made, otherwise than in a court of law and according to the proper rules of evidence. I have always regarded the National Crime Authority as being a better model for the investigation of these sorts of allegations than, for example, the commission that operates in New South Wales. I believe that people can have their reputations irreparably damaged by allegations which are made without regard to the rules of evidence and on a standard of proof which in the end, even if findings are made, would not satisfy a jury or criminal court. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, I believe that the National Crime Authority is a better model, more like the grand jury system in the United States, than the royal commission in open session in Australia. These are some of the matters which I believe are dealt with in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators from the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have indicated their support for the Bill. Senator Crichton-Browne asked when the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS> will be responded to by the Government. It is intended that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will respond to that report in the autumn session. Quite clearly, the Government has a report to which it needs to give very detailed and deliberate consideration, as does the Intergovernmental Committee of the NCA. One has to recall that the elected Ministers from all of the jurisdictions around Australia have a democratic role, a very necessary role, in our democracy in supervising the operations of the National Crime Authority. The Ministers would want to have the opportunity to consider the PJC report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Senate will have the benefit of that response in the autumn session next year, which will further strengthen the relationship which has to exist between the National Crime Authority, this Parliament and its committees. Only if we are confident that an authority vested with extraordinary powers, such as the National Crime Authority has, is under the proper supervision of the elected representatives of the people can we avoid sliding into the sometimes hysterical reaction to criminal activity which can vest enormous powers in law enforcement bodies but without sufficient democratic control of the exercise of those powers. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter which relates to the second amendment with respect to the provision of information and general references going to the States. I refer to the point that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) made in the second reading debate about the role of the IGC. The IGC will be required to look at the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority with respect to section 51.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the IGC's performance has been abysmal; it has failed in every single aspect of its obligations and responsibilities. It is a pompous committee which lectured and hectored the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority to the point where it had the audacity to suggest that that one proper effective watchdog should be abolished. To my knowledge, not one single reference which has been undertaken by the National Crime Authority since day one has come from the IGC. Between July 1984 and October 1991, the IGC has met on 16 occasions, and on each occasion for a matter of hours. That is the level of its monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that period we had the imbroglio of Operation Ark, the controversy surrounding Justice Stewart and Mr Farris and the machinations that were going on in the Authority without any direction, guidance or supervision from the IGC. It seems to have done absolutely nothing to address the problems. From my inquiries, it seems that it has washed its hands&mdash;or not been capable&mdash;of making any suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall, subsection 61(6) of the Act provides that the IGC may comment on the Authority's annual report and any comments made are required to be tabled in the Parliament with the report. The Government explained in 1984 that this provision was suggested by the State Ministers in discussion with the Commonwealth Ministers, and the Government saw no objection to it. It served to underline the cooperative scheme of the Bill. It might have done that, but it has done absolutely nothing else. The report says that the IGC made comments amounting to less than a page on each of the first three annual reports to the Authority. There have been no comments at all made by the IGC since the first three reports from 1984 onward. That lack of comment from the IGC strengthened the Committee's view and continues to strengthen its view that the IGC has not actively monitored the Authority. Many of the problems that the Authority has had over the years should have been dealt with directly by the IGC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it not only audacious but also impertinent for the IGC to dare even to contemplate the abolition of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority, which is the only body that sought or attempted to monitor the activities of the National Crime Authority. When we pursued the question of section 51, to give us a greater capacity to probe more effectively and more responsibly the activities of the National Crime Authority for the purpose of reporting to the Parliament and then to the wider community, we found that the IGC had frustrated our endeavours and ultimately suggested that the Committee be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I challenged one of the police Ministers, Mr Edwards from Western Australia, as to the grounds, he said it was something he thought he read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind supporting an amendment which provides that the activities of the National Crime Authority in respect of general references go directly to the State authorities, but I expect the State authorities to fulfil their obligations and their responsibilities, which thus far they have not done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in a position to confirm the accuracy of the report referred to by Senator Jones because of the difficulty in the present circumstances of maintaining contact between embassies in Belgrade and the city of Dubrovnik, but I can say that the latest reports are that the naval blockade of Dubrovnik has been lifted and a regular ferry service from Dubrovnik to surrounding islands has recommenced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that up to 50,000 people are believed to remain in the city. The city's population has been inflated by refugees from surrounding villages in the mountains and along the coast. About 12,000 are believed to have left the city on boats organised by EC observers and various European humanitarian groups. There may indeed be more women and children wishing to leave Dubrovnik and the Australian Government would be very concerned indeed if civilians were being prevented from leaving danger areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in answer to a question from Senator Jones on 28 November, with the arrival in Dubrovnik of two relief ships as well as other relief shipments organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other national and external relief organisations, the international community has been as active as circumstances allow in providing assistance to the people of Dubrovnik. The ICRC considers that the food and medical supply situation is not currently as desperate as it was during the naval blockade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the larger question asked by Senator Jones, we all of course regret that the basic precondition for the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation, namely, the maintenance of an effective cease-fire, remains as elusive as it does. The UN Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, said earlier this week that a cease-fire is indispensable if a UN peacekeeping operation is to be proposed, and I believe that still represents the view of the international community. His envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance, will report to the Secretary-General this week on the result of his recent discussions in Yugoslavia. All we can do as a government, I think, is call once again on the Yugoslav National Army and all other fighters to silence their guns and to cooperate with international efforts in favour of a peaceful solution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I was just saying that the accord that the Government has had with the Australian trade union movement over the last eight years has proved to be a very flexible tool in economic management. Let me give one example. In 1985 there was a rapid devaluation of the Australian dollar, with major inflationary effects. What happened then was that the Government negotiated with the trade union movement to accept a 2 per cent discount in wages for compensatory tax cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the cooperation and goodwill between the unions and the Government there was a maintenance of the real value of wages, there were moderate wage outcomes and we were able to manage inflation down to what it is now&mdash;3.3 per cent, below the OECD level. There is a good example of a government with an accord between it and the union movement&mdash;an incomes policy&mdash;being able to deal with an inflationary surge with compensatory tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I compare that to the goods and services tax proposal of the Opposition, there is admittedly a level of inflation estimated at 9.5 per cent by Syntec in 1994; there are tax cuts supposedly to compensate; but there is no agreement on the acceptance of that package with the union movement and no accord. So the Opposition has a hands off or leave it to the market type approach as to how the inflationary impact of a goods and services tax will be absorbed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to look at the best example of how this may have happened in real life in Australia, one must go back to the early 1980s when John Howard was Treasurer and Dr Hewson was an economic adviser to the Fraser Government. The last time the centralised wage system in Australia was abandoned was in the early 1980s and wage increases escalated to 18.8 per cent over the year to September 1982. So when the coalition abandoned a centralised wage system last time, wages exploded in this country because of the inflationary surge and because there was no agreement on the ways in which compensation would be fairly evened out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not introduce a goods and services tax; but if we did, we would contain it through an accord, something that, palpably, the Opposition cannot do. Clearly, on the experience of 1982, it would set up an inflationary surge which would ripple through the economy. Even if the compensation that the Opposition is proposing in its package were fair, which it is not, not only can the Opposition not get an agreement with the trade union movement, but also it has committed itself to destroying&mdash;its word, not ours&mdash;the trade union movement in Australia. I refer anyone who doubts that to page 2 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> dated 5 December 1991. They are the words of Dr Hewson. In other words, not only does the Opposition not want an agreement with the trade union movement to contain wages, but also it wishes to destroy it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition proposes to end national wage cases. In the past, national wage cases have been a forum where governments have argued for trade-offs in wage increases because of tax cuts made. The last time that happened was in the 1970s under the Fraser Government, which approached the Commission and argued that there ought to be a discount on wages&mdash;</PARA>

Secondly, in particular, can the Minister advise whether, in his view, Australia should then join one of the major trading blocs&mdash;for instance, the Americas or the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;and if so, which one?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite premature to make any judgment that the GATT round in Geneva is failing. Intensive negotiations are continuing in Geneva right now to finalise a package of results to conclude the round. The Director-General of GATT, Arthur Dunkel, intends to establish a political package extending right across all elements in the round by 20 December. This would be the basis for going on to complete the round in the next couple of months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the meetings early in November between President Bush, Prime Minister Lubbers of The Netherlands and the President of the European Community, Jacques Delors, contact has been intensified at head of government and officials level to resolve the remaining differences between the US and the EC, in particular on agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to the negotiations, of course, remains agriculture. The main participants, including the Cairns Group, have made progress toward narrowing the differences which do remain between them over the shape of an agriculture package. The US and the EC are continuing to meet at sub-cabinet level on this issue and there is no basis at this stage for the kind of pessimism that underlies Senator Spindler's question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Blewett chaired meetings of Cairns Group Ministers in Geneva on 8 and 9 December to consider the Cairns Group's approach to the final critical phase of the agriculture negotiations. Ministers also meet with Mr Dunkel to ensure that he understands what needs to be in an appropriate agricultural package to make it acceptable to our group, the third force in those negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it cannot be taken for granted at this stage, although we do remain optimistic, that the Round will come to a successful conclusion. It is not so much a matter in these circumstances of having contingency plans against failure as being prepared to intensify what the Government is really already doing as may be appropriate. What we are already doing, apart from in the Uruguay Round, is of course pursuing our trade interests in a variety of ways through bilateral negotiations and through regional exercises such as APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even while the Uruguay Round negotiations have been proceeding, Australia, in common with other members of GATT, has continued to pursue its rights and obligations under the existing GATT multilateral framework, and we would of course continue to do so, including exploring some new options that might be available under that particular framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, generally speaking, at this stage it is quite premature to speculate further about what might be the case if the Round should fail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to comment in any detail on that. It is premature to speculate about what kind of strategy we might be forced into should the Round fail. But might I say there is a bit of an oddity in Senator Spindler's question to the extent that he draws a contrast between the Asia-Pacific bloc on the one hand and the Americas on the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as we are concerned at the moment, the Asia-Pacific grouping of countries includes America and the very virtue of APEC that we have been most at pains to emphasise and promote is that it does straddle the Pacific; it includes North America and possibly some Latin American countries as well as time goes on, rather than being an artificial dividing device for separating the western Pacific rim from an area of the world, that is, the Americas, where there is a tremendous amount of trade linkage at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in Australia's overwhelming interest not to bed down perceptions that it is inevitable that the world will fall ultimately into three or more trading blocs, erecting defensive barriers against each other and waging aggressive trade war against each other. That way lies madness for a trading country like Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our interest is overwhelmingly in multilateral trade liberalisation in which there are no such barriers. There is no reason why there cannot be supplementary mechanisms like CER, like NAFTA in North America, like conceivably an ASEAN free trade area, provided they are consistent with GATT multilateral rules and provided they are trade creating rather than trade diverting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But any talk about blocs and making choices between defensive blocs in the kind of language that Senator Spindler is seeking to promote by his question is not in Australia's interest.

Senator Alston is quite right: this Government will certainly not be introducing a 15 per cent Federal tax on domestic electricity accounts in the Northern Territory. The reason is that, if such a thing were imposed, my power bill in the last quarter, along with many others in the same situation in Darwin, would rise from $350 to $402.50. That would be an increase for me and a lot of others of $210 a year in Federal taxes on a domestic power account.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely accurate, Senator. The difficulty is this&mdash;and Senator Boswell should listen to this:  honourable senators from both sides of the chamber have been complaining for years about the imposition of sales tax on freight, which of course a 15 per cent at point of sale tax would greatly exacerbate. But, in terms of regional equity&mdash;and I would ask honourable senators to listen&mdash;the GST would increase the cost differential of power between regional Australia and the southern States, although that is no surprise given that not one member of the Opposition's GST committee was from northern Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, consumers in the Northern Territory currently pay 12.9c per kilowatt hour for electricity, including fixed daily charges. The imposition of a 15 per cent tax would increase that by 2c per kilowatt hour. In New South Wales, however, where Dr Hewson lives, domestic consumers currently pay 6.8c per kilowatt hour, including fixed daily charges. Under a GST, this would increase by 1c per kilowatt hour. Over a one-year period, the average Northern Territory domestic electricity consumer would pay $70 a year more in Federal taxes than a consumer in New South Wales for using exactly the same amount of electricity.</PARA>

Given the growing concern in the United States Congress and in Europe about Indonesia's appalling record in East Timor since 1975 and the plea by the East Timorese delegation which met with the Minister on 3 December for Australia to support East Timor's right to self-determination, does the Government now accept not only that it is inappropriate to pursue the division of spoils under the Timor Sea with Indonesia but also that Australia should now move to use the good offices of the United Nations in the future of East Timor as Australia has supported and promoted recent United Nations initiatives in Yugoslavia and Cambodia?</PARA></TALK.START>

Finally, when is the Government going to acknowledge the greater costs which are borne by working parents and provide equitable tax relief for them?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4620" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's basic position is that it simply would not be equitable or efficient to provide assistance for child-care through the taxation system, given the need to target government assistance of this kind in a sensible way. Moreover, it is the case that the Government already provides generous assistance for child-care through the Budget. Let me justify those two statements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to our present assistance, we do provide income tested fee relief for child-care for eligible families using approved services including non-profit, commercial and employer sponsored services. The advantages of providing assistance in this way are that it is targeted according to need, it provides for monitoring and maintenance of standards of child-care facilities and it limits scope for abuse that could be associated with assistance provided through the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with providing tax deductibility for work related child-care, as attractive a concept as that often seems to people at first blush&mdash;it is certainly something that has been considered over the years by successive governments&mdash;is that in the first place it tends to assist those whose incomes are highest, the value of deductibility of course being determined by the taxpayer's marginal rate. This would not apply to a tax rebate, I acknowledge, which would be at a set rate per dollar of expense. Again, the value of tax deductibility or of an expense related rebate is determined by the level of relevant expenditure. That could be mitigated by capping the level of eligible expenditure, that is true;  but there is a problem of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it would add a complication to the taxation system. Employee pay-as-you-earn deduction arrangements would need to be varied for individual employees as their deduction rebate varied. An additional item would need to be included in the information provided to and considered by income tax payers when preparing their returns. These sorts of administrative complications are not insignificant as marginal&mdash;not central&mdash;considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third consideration is that it could open up avenues for abuse, especially excessive child-care payments for family members. This could be mitigated by narrowing eligibility, but at quite considerable cost in terms of complexity of legislation, compliance and administration. They are the reasons that traditionally have been articulated by the Government for going down the route of targeted child-care rather than tax deductibility. That is the basis on which we are presently administering policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer him to the costings of the coalition's Fightback plan by the Department of Finance, in which the Department said that the lowering of the qualifying age of the youngest dependent child from 16 years to 12 years for the sole parent pension `would address recognised work disincentives, particularly for part-time work, facing sole parent pensioners and would be consistent with the direction of policy in recent years towards lower dependence on income support'. Does the Minister therefore feel like an absolute goose&mdash;to borrow Senator Evans's latest term of endearment&mdash;now that his dishonest scare campaign of recent days regarding this aspect of the coalition's package has been refuted by another Minister?  Was Senator Richardson consulted beforehand about this matter or about Finance's endorsement of the coalition's policy in relation to the pension paid to the wives of disability support pensioners?  If not, does Senator Richardson accept that the new Treasurer, Mr Willis, released these comments from Finance to present yet another rebuff to Senator Richardson, who has been attempting to have his portfolio exempted from the economic review committee process?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a top question. As a matter of fact, I would have thought all honourable senators would recall that it is only a few days since Senator Crowley asked me a question to the effect that has the Government ever considered a reduction of the age from 16 years to 12 years. I said yes. There is no great secret about it. Of course, when the Department of Finance rolled it up, I rolled it over. I might say that I was able to do that without great effort. Anyone who is a Cabinet member will recall that the Government rolled this very easily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston has to understand that this Department of Finance is an independent, fearless group of men and women who do not necessarily accept everything that the Government puts up because they have some of their own ideas. Ideas like this get rolled up from time to time and when they get rolled up they get rolled over. They get rolled over by Labor governments because we will not accept the extraordinary, cruel consequences of ever taking that kind of action.</PARA>

It will not be knocked back because of any brilliance of my oratory; it gets knocked back because none of my Cabinet colleagues accept that it is a reasonable course of action.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Can the Minister inform the Senate how the commercial support program, announced as part of the force structure review, is progressing?  Has the Minister seen claims that further savings of up to $500m could be made to the Defence budget, redirecting $300m to enhance combat capability and returning $200m to Consolidated Revenue?  Does the Minister intend to implement such proposals?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4622" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The commercial support program that Defence is currently undertaking had its genesis in the Wrigley report on the force structure review. For instance, between 1993 and 1995 the program will bring about savings of around $510m. The reason it can bring about such substantial savings without other costs is that it was very much crafted to meet the attrition rate that occurs in the armed services. We have a situation where it basically motors along on the attrition rate and does not require redundancies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen some very confused proposals around which vary from day to day. I saw one suggestion today that a future government may in fact contemplate a $200m return to Consolidated Revenue over three years. It is a pity that the person who put that out had not read the source material because, when one reads the source material and the tables, they suggest that $450m over three years will be returned to Consolidated Revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that Senator Vallentine is not paying attention at the moment because here at last is Senator Vallentine's peace dividend: $450m over three years to be ripped out of the Defence budget. Senator Vallentine should smile because she has finally made it. She has finally got a major influence group in Australia wanting the payment of a peace dividend&mdash;to just rip it straight out of the Defence budget and plonk it back into Consolidated Revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem with this is that we are not given any real detail of how this is going to occur. Inferences are drawn that there will be large staff cuts. If, for instance, one wanted to save $500m over two years, it would be necessary to get rid of about 15,000 employees&mdash;say 10,000 civilians and 5,000 in the armed services. Of course, that overlooks a few matters. This proposal would involve redundancies. So what would happen in those first two years is that one would not get $300m redirected to the combat area and one would not get $200m in peace dividends plonked into Consolidated Revenue; one would have to pay back into Defence somewhere between $193m and $332m, according to the degree of contracting out of civilians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of proposals floating around mean that, instead of saving money, in the initial years they will cost an enormous amount of money to fund from some section of government. That is the great difficulty and that is the great failure. Of course, eventually, in the fourth, fifth or sixth years, one starts to get savings, after having completely vandalised the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read today that there are other proposals around to make these savings. A very interesting suggestion from Senator Durack was to cut 10 per cent off every corporate service. It would involve reducing Comcare payments by 10 per cent, when there are statutory requirements. It would involve a 10 per cent cut in fringe benefit, yet that is fully supplemented to Defence and would bring about absolutely no savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure of 10 per cent is terribly interesting. I thought, `If an alternative government recommends all this, why don't we check its track record?', and I did. There is only one person sitting on the other side of the chamber who has ever been a Minister. I thought I would see how ruthless this person was when he was Attorney-General. Unfortunately, I found that under the stewardship of my colleague Senator Durack over there, the number of employees in the Attorney-General's Department went up 10 per cent. I found that the real growth in the expenditure of the Attorney-General's Department went up by 10 per cent over that time, well in advance of inflation. It is the old case of those who cannot do, teach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is particularly annoying to me&mdash;and this is why I will not implement these proposals&mdash;is that as Minister for Defence I have had to put up with a number of people opposite wandering around defence facilities saying, `Senator Ray is a mean Minister for Defence; we will pour more money in'. Yet in the first three years in government those opposite would effectively rip $450m out of Defence. They cannot do it by savings on personnel costs. In the end, if they insist on it, and I hope they do not, they will have to rip it out of capital equipment acquisitions&mdash;smile again, Senator Vallentine, this is right up your street&mdash;or operating costs. Smile again Senator Vallentine. Your speeches during the adjournment debate have obviously affected the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real tragedy is that the Government has been lectured to time and time again by the Opposition that we cannot be trusted on defence policy. For one reason or another, we are not to be entrusted with the guidance of defence. When it came to the crunch, Dr Hewson and others came up with these proposals&mdash;there was no consultation with any of their defence spokesmen. The people opposite who take an interest were not consulted at all. You might stare at me, Senator MacGibbon; you want 3 per cent of GDP for defence&mdash;an extra $2.5m.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make it perfectly clear, I issued a statement on the day that the Fightback package was launched by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The expenditure proposals in relation to Defence were over three years, not over any one year. Senator Robert Ray came in here and claimed that the Opposition has suggested savings of $450m. He has taken that wrong assumption from the Department of Finance information given by the current Treasurer (Mr Willis) the other day. Finance itself seems to have become confused about what is perfectly clear&mdash;namely, that the savings proposed by the Opposition will be over a three-year period and the net savings will be only $200m, not $450m as Senator Robert Ray claims. Whether Finance has that misunderstanding or not is perhaps not clear from its own statements, but Senator Ray certainly made that claim in his answer to a question today and he is quite wrong. I totally refute that claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a quite remarkable criticism by Senator Ray about the number of Defence positions which would go if in fact what he seemed to think was a shock-horror proposal of the Opposition was put into effect. He claimed that over the three-year period 15,000 Defence jobs would go. I would like to draw attention to Senator Ray's much vaunted force structure review which he brought down in this place on 30 May this year. He was very fortunate that little attention was paid to the force structure review by the media or anybody else, because that was the day before the last challenge to Mr Hawke by Mr Keating. Senator Ray had further diversions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The force structure review proposes that over this decade 10,450 jobs will be taken from Service personnel and 3,840 from civilian employees. On my arithmetic, over 14,000 jobs will be lost from Defence through the Government's own force structure review. I remind Senator Ray that, of the jobs that have been taken from Defence, over 5,000 will come from the regular combat forces&mdash;the Army and the Air Force. It is the Opposition's policy to ensure that the burden of savings in the Defence portfolio will come from the base support end, not from combat related areas. That is a firm commitment that we have made all along. </PARA>

It makes it perfectly clear that the savings from Defence will be only $200m. The honourable senator can shake his head, but he should look at that document and he will see that he is completely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray talked about a number of other matters. I think he was referring to a release that I issued today showing that savings of over $300m can be made over a three-year period in administrative areas without the loss of any positions at all. Those savings were based on the Government's recently released defence commercial support manual, which has provided for the first time real details of administrative costs&mdash;not salaries and wages &mdash;such as travel and subsistence and office requisites, totalling over $1 billion a year. The one and only quote that Senator Ray made from this release was in relation to fringe benefits, which represented a small saving of $500,000. There will be savings in computer services and advertising of $20m a year. So there is a huge area of fat in the Department of Defence in administration costs&mdash;not salaries and wages.

I do not quarrel with the figure in terms of what should be done in an ideal world. I do not even say that Senator MacGibbon argues that it would go up by that much in one hit, that is, $2.5 billion.

So when we want to do more, we can do more, but that immediately starts reducing personnel numbers even more. Senator Durack says that the Government will reduce them by 14,000.

The number of his employees went through the roof. Senator Durack is no ruthless cutter; he is just an old-fashioned mercantilist, pretending to be dry, but we will let that go by. To achieve the Opposition's commercial support program what is involved is making redundant, eliminating, sacking&mdash;whatever term you like to use&mdash;existing personnel and having outsiders do the job. On average, that is 20 per cent cheaper than having uniformed people, and in the far out years a higher percentage than 20 per cent could be achieved. To do that, the Opposition goes below the attrition rate and it has to go straight into redundancies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come right back and point this out to Senator Durack: read the whole 700 pages because the Opposition allows $200m in the overall package for redundancies, and then on another page the Opposition specifically exempts industrial relations and defence from the package. It specifically exempts those areas and says that they are not part of the $200m. The only inference any sensible person can draw is that the redundancies will have to be absorbed in the defence area, because there is no allocation in the rest of the program for those redundancies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is talking about getting $500m in savings from redundancies. I have used just one example today. If 15,000 people go, we still do not make $500m over two years. The Opposition would have to pay these people redundancies at a reasonable rate, plus bring forward and pay off their long service leave, pay off their accrued holiday leave and other entitlements, and bring forward the cost of their pensions. The Opposition will have to bring forward the pensions for each person it lets go&mdash;either civil or military. In a lot of cases, we are talking about lump sums. The cost to the overall totality of government policy means that in the end, to make those savings, which are achievable in the far out years&mdash;I totally acknowledged that in my answer today&mdash;the Opposition will have to put the money in first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no use saying that we have allowed for 14,000 to go. That is on the attrition rate. Every cut the Opposition makes will have to be paid for in terms of redundancy and brought forward pensions. The massive costing comes in, if that happens to be the alternative way, through commercial support. I suppose I could ask: is the Opposition going to get rid of civilians? If it is, will it contract out any of their services? There is dead silence again, because this has been discussed in only nine paragraphs. There is a fair bit of detail in this. We want to know at what rate the Opposition is going to contract out. The Opposition does not say so, or is it just saying that it can move in and sack 5,000 or 10,000 civilians out of a total of 24,000, get exactly the same product and have no problems?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition spends nine paragraphs saying virtually nothing. It says it will send $200m back to Consolidated Revenue and have another $300m worth of savings. There is absolutely nothing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened, for the information of Senator Crichton-Browne, is that the shadow Minister for defence was not consulted on these cuts before the shadow Cabinet meeting. The figures did not add up and the shadow Cabinet got a bit desperate so it thought, `We have to pay a couple of hundred million dollars out of there and a few hundred million out of there and a few hundred million out of there'. Then when the shadow Cabinet put it to the shadow Minister, what could he say? `Yes, I can deliver'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course anyone would say that. I would have said it, too. The shadow Cabinet has spent the last few weeks trying to work out how it can deliver. It has not worked it out at all. Senator Alston, Senator Short and Senator Durack may want to get up and say, `There will be no staff cuts in defence. We will not have any savings that particular way', which means the Opposition cannot then contract out through the commercial support program; it will have to find the money somewhere else. It can go the cargo cult route of Senator Newman: `Yes, we can find it here with fraud. We will find it here and we will find it there'&mdash;and all the rest of the rubbish she goes on with as the shop steward for the colonels. She does that all the time without being able to prove one thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these proposals remind me of the difference between possibility and probability. It is possible to birdie every hole of 18 holes of golf. It is not very probable. It is possible to make some savings in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth out-year. But if in the meantime the Opposition rips the money out of defence and it cannot make the savings through staff cuts or in other areas, it has to take it off the more vital areas&mdash;or it has to renege on the promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises another question not central to defence. If the Opposition cannot deliver that money back to Consolidated Revenue, how do we bring about a proper compensation package or tax cuts? If the Opposition does not have the money, it cannot do it, and this is just one example of several departments where the Opposition will not be able to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw this point to the Senate's attention: the Opposition wants to save $500m. The most extreme advocate of that, I think one could fairly say, and not in a critical way, is Mr Alan Wrigley, who said that we might be able to get savings of $350m a year, not calculating in redundancies, in the sixth out-year. That was with massive cuts, much more than under the force structure review&mdash;much more even than the Opposition had ever contemplated in its wildest fantasy. It would have rejected such cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the most optimistic scenario Mr Wrigley, with a degree of double counting, could ever put on the public record. So there is a serious credibility problem with these proposals. We do look for more substance than we have heard today. We do look for a proper proposal that can be quite fairly costed. With a ready reckoner and fair officials, rather than just looking through the political bias which may be on my side, we might be able to put these figures through the wringer to see whether they are feasible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side have to fight a phantom. There are no detailed proposals. Why do we have no detailed proposals?

Who determines the exempt nature of what and what bureaucracy is required are not factored into these proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move on to two or three other points to show how shabby, shallow and poorly thought-through this document is. It says this: `We are going to save money in Defence by halving the use of the VIP fleet, 34 Squadron'. Anyone knows that the cost of that is attributable to Administrative Services and not Defence. That is where the charge is made. Honourable senators opposite probably know &mdash;maybe even Senator MacGibbon would have a clear idea&mdash;that halving usage does not halve the cost. That is for a variety of reasons. VIP aircraft fly around empty while people get their flying hours up, for a start; and of course there is no clawback for commercial tickets forgone. The comments on the VIP fleet are hairshirt statements such as, `Let's knock the pollie mentality. Let's ride the wave. Let's abuse ourselves'. This is so popular in oppositions. It is reflected through a lot of areas. I will live with that. I do not mind that type of cheap shot being taken but it does not deliver the savings, and it certainly does not deliver the savings to Defence. The idea of having five leased Falcons flying around empty while people get up their hours, with no recouping of tickets, is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area I think I should address is the effect of some other proposals on superannuation. It really takes a bit of reading of the document to try to establish what effects it would have on superannuation. In the Opposition's policy, retirees have to wait and retire at age 60 or an early specified retiring age. That is fine. We have a lot of early specified retiring ages in Defence. Our real problem, of course, is that 99 per cent leave before they get to the specified point. So this particular provision, unless those opposite today or in the next couple of days say that they will exempt Defence, will have a devastating effect. I ask Senator Newman to think that through because it is not part of defence policy; it is another part of the package. I ask her to think through the effect that a flat 20 per cent tax on lump sums will have on people in the Services compared with people in other occupations, given the traditions of people moving out of the Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, a third claim in this substantive factual material. The claim is made that ADI head office has gone from 1,300 to 42 staff. The fact is that most reductions occurred when Williamstown dockyard was sold and the Government Aircraft Factories went off to ASTA. So it is not a question of ADI coming down by that much. When ADI was set up, the number went from 1,300 to 300. So the reduction&mdash;we should correct this in the Opposition's document&mdash;is from 300 to 90. That is a good figure, by the way; it is a very impressive figure. But the figure of 42 is rubbish because those people are in one head office and other head office officials are distributed around a variety of factories. So this great claim that we can just cut the fat off the top and knock the figure down from 1,300 to 42 becomes a still reasonable claim that we can knock it down from 300 to 90. But, by gee, there was not much homework put into that, was there?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will divert for a moment to something I have overlooked. This morning a press release was put out under Senator Durack's name. It says, `One of the ways we will save $108m in the first year and maybe the second year is to cut 10 per cent off absolutely everything'. How do we take 10 per cent off the Comcare premium when it is a statutory requirement? How do we take 10 per cent off the fringe benefit tax bill, when Defence does not pay it and is fully supplemented for it? That was part of the agreement at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we take 10 per cent off defence removal costs? Do we just pull it off the budget?  Do we drive to Alice Springs and say, `Look, walk the rest of the way to Darwin'. This is infantile. I concede, though&mdash;and I will be fair&mdash;that there are three or four things on this list which could have 10 per cent taken off without it being the end of the world. Let me go to some of them. In advertising, 10 per cent of $19.94m is $1.994m. I hate to tell honourable senators opposite, but we are looking to try to take $4m off that figure at the moment. But I totally agree that that is achievable. </PARA>

It is not an appropriate policy to betray the defence forces of Australia for cheap political reasons. They are far too important for that and the Opposition should rethink its policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. The Minister has just rehearsed his speech here. I hope he goes a little better at his press interview than he went in that speech. The Minister must have extraordinarily shallow political experience if he expects an Opposition to come out with a precisely detailed package of what they will do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues are very clear for this country. We have had eight years of bungling incompetence, in which we have gone from a debt position of $30-odd billion to a debt of $135 billion or more. Somewhere between one-half and one-third of our export earnings are going just to pay the interest on that debt and the economy is in a really critical state. Everything else this Government has touched is in the same condition: the same cowboy approach has been brought to the affairs of state as a result of 8 1/2 years of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Opposition are saying that we will do better. We will fix the mess&mdash;we will fix the mess economically and we will fix the Government's mess in all other departments of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite unreal for Senator Ray to attack the members of the Opposition for not putting forward a detailed plan. Anyone who has been in politics for any length of time knows that that is not the role of the Opposition. The role of the Opposition, in presenting policies before an election, is to provide guideposts, to say, `This is where we're going to go and where we're going to take the country in these various areas'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not for the Opposition to dot the last `i' or cross the last `t'. We simply cannot do that. In the first place, we do not have the information and, secondly, we do not have the resources. The Government has spent probably tens of millions of dollars in overtime, computer time and consultants' time looking at the GST package in the last three or four weeks. It has not been able to find a crack in it&mdash;not a fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is irrelevant. The important thing is that the Government has all of these resources to call on; we do not have those. We literally have to put our own money into writing policies. That really does not matter; it is the way it has always happened with oppositions. At least we have the ideas. Quite clearly, this Government has no ideas. It has lost all of its creative thought, if indeed it ever possessed much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the reason why I am on my feet. I apologise if I misrepresent what Senator Ray said, but Senator Macdonald and Senator Olsen were talking to me at the time. I understood Senator Ray to say that I had put out a press release today saying that we needed 3 per cent of gross domestic product attributed to defence. I did put out an excellent press release this morning, but I certainly did not mention GDP in any part of it. The burden of my press release was that the Government operates its Department of Defence in accordance with two publications: the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia 1987</EMPHASIS>, the White Paper which was presented in 1987; and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Strategic Plans 1990</EMPHASIS>. Those two publications, by the Government's own admission, define the priorities, duties and responsibilities of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My press release pointed out that, by the standards set by the Government in 1987, which were reconfirmed and modified slightly in 1990, the Government had failed to meet its own objectives. One of the essential points contained in DOA 1987 was that the defence vote had to grow by between 2.7 per cent and 3 per cent in real terms in order to achieve the objectives. I pointed out that the Government had never maintained adequate funding. In fact, since DOA 1987 was brought down, we have never had any growth in the defence budget. The defence vote actually declined in real terms in a couple of years. The best it has done in the other years is break even. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My press release pointed out that the Government ought to meet its own objectives and that that required, by its definition, between 2.7 per cent and 3 per cent real growth on the budget of the year before. I went on in my press release to talk about the fact that the Government had not met the capability and readiness requirements that were defined in its publications. So the Government fell down both in terms of funding and in the preparedness that was implicit in the documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray had a great time, both part way through and at the end of his speech, attacking the Opposition about its review committee. I am totally at a loss to understand what he is on about there. We are not accountable to the Government of the day for the private committees we set up, the number of meetings we have or whom we talk with, and we do not have to seek his permission to bring a report down or anything like that. I know there is a totalitarian streak in the Labor Party as evidenced by the way it brought in the ban on advertising Bill last week and rammed it through with a jackbooted guillotine with the support of the Far Left branch of the Labor Party and the Democrats, but we are entitled to run our own review committees to develop our policies. We do not have to answer to the Government in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it very dangerous for the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to talk about the integrity and the probity of committees. Only this year we had a big committee set up in Defence&mdash;the Force Structure Review Committee. That Committee produced a report in March which the Government implemented and which led, amongst other things, to the setting up of the Ready Reserve. In the process it got rid of two of only six regular infantry battalions in the country, which is a huge loss. One-third of our capacity, of our combat regular forces, disappeared at the stroke of a pen. That Committee also made other recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Force Structure Review Committee presented an extraordinarily shallow, superficial and intellectually indefensible report. No argument was advanced as to how it came to its conclusions, and one is left, without being too unkind about it, with the view that it was simply a political document created by the Government to initiate cost cutting measures. I do not wish to debate the findings of the Force Structure Review Committee here, but the very last person to be talking about committees and what they do should be the present Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the position was exacerbated because, whilst the Minister has considerable ability, he has been totally preoccupied for the whole year with trying to keep his great mentor, Mr Hawke, in office. A consequence of that is that he has handed over not only the matters that should be transferred under the administrative arrangements to his junior Minister, Mr Bilney, but also a considerable number of policy decisions which are demonstrably way beyond Mr Bilney's intellectual or professional abilities to cope with. That has exacerbated the position within the Department of Defence because the Minister has not been putting the whole of his effort into running his Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister tried to muddy the waters a bit by talking about some of the proposals we have made with respect to equipment. We do not want to go too far into the subject of equipment because we are certainly not in the business of presenting a shopping list to the people of Australia when we go to an election with our defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is quite wrong to attribute the losses of the minehunter inshore program to the previous Fraser Government. Goodness me, the Fraser Government went out of office in March 1983. In the period from March 1983 up to the present the minehunter inshore program has been funded by this Government. It admits to a loss of about $102m. When one talks to people in the Navy one learns the real loss is in excess of $160m. Most of that loss, probably better than 95 per cent, is a consequence of the lack of administrative control and surveillance by this Government on a program that simply was not working right at the outset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the minehunter program has gone on, dragging money out of the taxpayer with no possibility of return at all, is, in my judgment, absolutely scandalous. It is still going on: tens of millions of dollars are still being spent on the minehunter program even though it has failed. The Government knows that, and it is going out to buy a totally different platform&mdash;a totally different ship and a totally different sonar system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other types of equipment that this Government has got into is the light armoured vehicle&mdash;the LAV25&mdash;about which quite a lot of information was advanced at the Estimates Committee a couple of months ago. It is something that was never researched, something that was never in the program. It was a spontaneous purchase by Mr Beazley because he liked the vehicles when he saw them in America a couple of years ago. We had a $25m buy initially to test these vehicles. When they came on test, they failed pretty well every element of the test that the Army gave them. Yet the Government is still going ahead and committing hundreds of millions of dollars to buy them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tests on this vehicle showed that in the area of its operation in the Northern Territory its tyres could not cope with the off-road conditions. It bogged in wet weather. It could not be used in summer because, with internal temperatures in excess of about 45 degrees centigrade, it was quite uninhabitable. It did not have the design strength to cope with the loads of personnel and weapons that the Army has to put in it. In other words, in every sense, that vehicle is a lemon. It does not meet any standards set at all, yet the Government is going ahead to buy it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about the AEW&amp;C aircraft, the airborne early warning and control aircraft, that Senator Ray talked about. I have been in the Senate for nearly 14 years. I am pleased to see Senator Tate in the chamber because he will recall very well that 12 years ago in the old Parliament House I spent quite a lot of time talking about the purchase of the new tactical fighter aircraft and radars. He would still remember interjecting on side lobes when I was talking about radar propagation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the argument for the new tactical fighter led me to the need for an AEW&amp;C aircraft. I have been talking about that in this Parliament for over 12 years. It is quite dishonest, with the greatest of respect, for the Minister to say, `We cannot buy that now because the technology will be out of date'. There have been AEW&amp;C aircraft since the mid-1940s. In time everything is superseded by later developments. To say that we will not buy these aircraft because the technology is not fully developed is to show a total lack of understanding of the technology that is currently available and, more importantly, of the essential need for this capability within the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take on the Minister on that point. Were I the Defence Minister I would go out straightaway and start a program to purchase AEW&amp;C aircraft for this country. I would get DSTO and a prime contractor overseas, in a partnership agreement, to do the developmental research so that we would have a system applicable to the conditions that we have in Australia, which are quite different from those in the NATO theatre for which most AEW&amp;C aircraft are optimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To tell the Senate that we cannot buy these aircraft yet because the technology is not fully refined is to mislead the Senate. We need this capability, and we need to start working on it now. Even if we started working on it now, it would probably be eight to 10 years before that capability would be in service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I just want to go back to where I started and to say that the 26 minutes that we had from Senator Ray was purely a political attack on the Opposition; it lacked any substance at all. We will go to the Australian people at the next election giving guidelines and pointing to the directions where we want to go with the Australian Defence Force. Very clearly, we want to give members of the Australian public very much better value for their dollar than they are getting at present. The whole burden of what Senator Ray was saying was: `I am perfect; I am a perfect administrator; I am getting you 110c for every $1 I spend. No-one can hold up any critical approach to me and say that he or she can do it cheaper and better'. That is absolute nonsense. In the expenditure of almost $10 billion per year, it can be done better. If, as Minister, I could not pick up $200m in savings by being a bit more efficient and producing exactly the same outcomes as we have at present, I would resign not only as Minister but also from the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to participate briefly in this debate mainly to correct some of the straight, factual errors that peppered the whole of Senator Ray's remarks in this discussion. I start by fully supporting the final remarks of my colleague Senator MacGibbon, who echoes the whole view of the coalition in relation to value for money in defence. Anyone who says that there is no scope for more efficient and more effective value for money&mdash;better value for the defence dollar than now exists&mdash;obviously does not understand anything at all about the defence forces or, indeed, the public sector as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's proposals contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, which really have prompted this discussion today, are not about saving money just for the sake of saving money. Certainly, as far as Defence is concerned, they are not about less defence; they are about more defence, better defence and more efficient defence. If this Government has given away any thought of attempting to achieve greater efficiency in our defence forces and better value for money, then it is yet another mark of what is increasingly seen as a disintegrating government&mdash;a very old, tired government with no ideas at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say at the outset that I take great offence at the implication in Senator Ray's remarks that somehow or other the Australian Labor Party and Labor governments have a more intrinsic and more important view of defence than do the Liberal and National parties. The whole history of Australia has been wrought and littered with the failure by the Labor Party and Labor governments to give proper and appropriate support to defence. Throughout history they have neglected the importance of a strong, efficient Defence Force. Therefore, I refute Senator Ray's imputations as sheer humbug and hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now refer to some of the particular points of detail that Senator Ray mentioned. He has had at his disposal all the resources of government and has had three weeks to come up with something meaningful and accurate by way of comment on the coalition's Fightback proposals. Today he put out some statement while at a luncheon with journalists. I do not know what the statement was; we have not seen it. I know that it will be subjected to the most stringent examination by the coalition when we get it. It is amazing that it has taken three weeks, as I recall, for Senator Ray to make a response of any nature to the Fightback proposals for defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What staggers me is that, having taken all that time and having had all the resources of government at his disposal, he still got it absolutely wrong. I do not know whether Senator Ray has read the document. To give him the benefit of the doubt, I hope he has not read it. If he has read the document and made the crass elementary errors that he has made, then he had better go back to school because he will have completely misread the document. He rabbited on for a lengthy period about the amount of money that was going to be saved in net terms as a result of the Fightback proposals. Somehow or other he came up with a figure of $450m. That is simply wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Table 16.1, on page 230 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">! </EMPHASIS>document, is a summary of the proposed three-year expenditure program. The table has three columns; it is very easy to read. The first column is headed, `Increases in Outlays', the second column is headed, `Decreases in Outlays' and the third column is headed, `Net Savings'. With respect to defence, the first column shows that there is a $300m increase in outlays; the second column shows that there is a $500m decrease in outlays; and the third column shows that there are net savings of $200m. I do not understand how Senator Ray could possibly have got that wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Table 16.2, on the very next page, shows the expenditure savings by year for each of the three years. We have shown that in the first year there would be an increase in outlays of $100m, a decrease of $150m; in the second year there would be an increase of $200m in outlays, a decrease of $350m; and, in the third year, nil either way, giving a net savings figure of $200m. What we are talking about could not be clearer than that. I just do not understand how Senator Ray got that so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a document which was released by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) a couple of days ago, the Department of Finance made some comments on defence. I am not sure whether the Department got it wrong but, in reading its remarks, it looks as though it may have. The Department said&mdash;as I read its prose&mdash;that it considers the savings proposed by the coalition to be feasible and that they could be accommodated within the defence portfolio, but with some impact on capability in early years. I do not know what that means; the Department has not spelt that out. Perhaps, in due course, Senator Ray might come back and tell us what it means. The Department of Finance has said that the savings are feasible; it has not, in any shape or form, found any hole in the proposals from an arithmetic point of view&mdash;or any other point of view, for that matter&mdash;so far as it relates to virtually everything in the coalition's proposals, including defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray also went on at considerable length about how we could achieve the gross savings of $500m which we are proposing over the three-year period. He implied that all of that money would be saved as a result of getting rid of people. Our proposals certainly envisage a reduction in personnel. That is quite clear; we have made no secret of that. But we have not said at any time that all of the gross savings would occur in that way. I refer to the report of the Auditor-General on fraud in the Defence Department. It is a very important document. I wonder whether Senator Ray has read it. It points to considerable fraud occurring in Defence; therefore, considerable savings are to be made with better fraud control. Page 249 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">!</EMPHASIS> document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more rigorous approach to capital equipment cost management will yield savings.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether Senator Ray thinks no savings are possible there. I would find it strange if he did say that. My colleague Senator MacGibbon referred to the inshore minehunter project&mdash;this is spelt out on page 249 of our document. The project was cancelled in May 1991, but only after some $95m had been spent on developing prototypes which did not meet specifications. In the 1991-92 Budget&mdash;the current Budget&mdash;a further $13m has been allocated to the project, despite the earlier cancellation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Newman points out, the fraud investigation was very relevant to that too. There is considerable scope for savings by a better and more professional approach, and perhaps a little more ministerial attention to the activities of the Defence Department in the area of capital equipment and cost management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press release that Senator Durack put out today followed the release, at long last&mdash;for the first time&mdash;by the Government of some of the overheads involved in defence activities. These were contained in the commercial support manual recently released by the Department of Defence. That shows very easily how savings could be made in overheads, again, without necessarily touching on the question of levels of employment. We are not resiling from some reduction in employment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various ways in which the savings of $500m over the three-year period can and will be achieved. If Senator Ray is saying that that is not achievable, then I can only say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he really is not trying in his job and he should not be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to a couple of real furphies. Senator Ray set up the greatest straw man that I have ever heard set up in this Parliament. He went on for about five minutes about what would happen if the Government had to pay GST, or there had to be some sort of GST compensation. I kept telling him that it would not pay GST.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer Senator Ray to pages 15 and 16 of supplementary paper No. 5 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. If he or some of his acolytes had taken the time to read this document; if he had used some of the resources of the Public Service, which were at his unlimited disposal at taxpayers' expense to try to knock holes in this thing; and if they had half a brain and had read the technical manual on the GST, they would have read section 5.4.3, which deals with supplies by public sector bodies.

<PARA>I refer Senator Ray to page 16 of supplementary paper No. 5 of the Fightback package. I hope that he will have the courtesy and the decency to come back into this chamber at some stage, admit that he set up the greatest straw man of all time and apologise to everyone who heard him make that absolute furphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next absolute furphy of Senator Robert Ray came in his reference to redundancies. The coalition has provided $200m by way of provision for redundancy payments; we do not know whether that will be required, and we do not think it will all be needed but, on all reasonable calculations, it is a very generous estimate. Senator Robert Ray said that Defence and Industrial Relations were excluded from this redundancy payment. I have news for the Minister. He is again wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know which bit of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> documents the Minister has misread; I can only assume that he has confused redundancy payments with the exclusion&mdash;which is an exclusion, and it is specifically stated in the documents&mdash;of Defence and Industrial Relations from the 10 per cent cut in corporate services of government departments. We have done that because, as we have spelt out very carefully in the document, we have treated Defence differently: we say there is scope for administrative and related savings of 10 per cent across the board in the Department of Defence and therefore we excluded Defence from another 10 per cent cut in the corporate services area in order to prevent double counting&mdash;in other words, to prevent any conceptual hole at all appearing in the package. I assume that is the basis for Senator Ray's error, but I repeat that it is a totally elementary error. I hope that in due course Senator Ray will be big enough to come in here and admit that error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of comments on superannuation. I will not go into superannuation in any great detail, in view of the time and the fact that it is a very complicated subject. Let me just refute quite unequivocally the assertions that Senator Robert Ray made in relation to superannuation and whether they put any hole in the logic or the arithmetic of our proposals. They do not. I think it is another example of a complete misunderstanding. I hope it is just a misunderstanding and not a deliberate misrepresentation by the Minister. He is not that sort of person normally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Defence superannuation, the coalition has always recognised that the Defence Force superannuation schemes are very different from normal superannuation schemes, and for very important policy reasons&mdash;that we need to have a superannuation scheme in relation to the defence forces that is in tune with the need for a young, fit, vigorous Defence Force. For that reason, the provisions in Defence Force superannuation schemes have always been different from normal superannuation schemes in various respects. That is a subject for a different day, but I think it is important to make that point here and now. I completely refute everything that Senator Ray said in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always had a pretty high regard and respect for Senator Ray. I think he normally does his homework and does a pretty good job relative to some of the other characters on the other side of the chamber. It is unusual for Senator Ray to make elementary errors at all, but it is almost unbelievable that he could have made the number of elementary errors that he did in his statement today. I can only assume that he has other, more pressing, weightier matters on his mind. I do not know where he has gone for his latest appointment. I do not know whether he has gone to do the tap on the shoulder or whether he is still  doing the number counting before he does that, but he was obviously very distracted from his normal ministerial responsibilities today. Hopefully, that is the reason for his crass errors. Perhaps he will get his mind back on the job before too long. </PARA>

I just want to put on record that the ALP, led by John Curtin, has a record that is second to none in the history of this Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government has decided as a political tactic to use Question Time to attack the Opposition package, which I would argue is strictly outside the Standing Orders, but the President says it is very difficult to determine when it is in answer to a question and when it is debating and, therefore, he is giving Ministers the benefit of the doubt. Then Senator Collins in this instance puts down a whole lot of material in the form of an attack, part of a one-sided debate, on our package, which material, we say, is blatantly untrue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister made a very long speech during Question Time about the additional costs he would have to pay on electricity. I think he said he would have to pay an increase of something like $52 on his electricity bill because of the effects of the GST. I do not accept that figure, but I want to point out to the Senate that Senator Collins, just on his fuel bill alone, will save some $400 per year because of the complete abolition of the fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particularly benefits those of us who live in northern Australia. Because of where we live we use our vehicles much more than people in the cities. We have longer distances to drive. The cost of fuel is enormous in northern Australia. The complete abolition of the fuel excise and its replacement for private motorists by the GST will mean fuel will be 19c per litre cheaper for everyone using his or her motor vehicle. Senator Collins well knows&mdash;and I am glad he has come into the chamber&mdash;that that is particularly significant for those of us who live in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one happens to be in business, if one happens to rely upon freight to get one's goods to these more remote areas, the 26c per litre excise will be gone and the GST will be rebated in full. That will mean an enormous saving, which makes things so much easier for those of us living in the bush and in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins made great play on his air conditioner. He is lucky enough&mdash;wealthy enough&mdash;to be able to afford one. Of course, many people have air conditioners in north Queensland. One pays 30 per cent wholesale sales tax on refrigerators, air conditioners and other whitegoods. What will it be under the coalition's policy? That will be wiped out completely and replaced with a 15 per cent GST. So again, air conditioners will be much cheaper. Refrigerators, which are used extensively in north Queensland and northern Australia, will be that much cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payroll tax will be abolished, which will have very big benefits to northern Australia. Personal income tax cuts will be particularly significant. There are big improvements in the GST package for children in isolated areas, particularly those living in northern Australia, where many have to rely on assistance with education. All of that will have a very significant impact on the cost of living in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's program seriously and positively addresses the question of the zone rebate. Mr Hawke comes to north Queensland, northern Australia, once a year or thereabouts&mdash;it is not much more than that. Every time he comes he is asked about the zone tax rebate. He always tells the same sorts of mistruths: that he is looking into it, that he is having an inquiry undertaken and that he will do something about it, but he has not done one thing about it. In fact, it has not altered for some five or six years. It means that the significance of the zone rebate has been substantially reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The zone rebate was very important. It was introduced to try to compensate in some way those people living in remote Australia for the additional costs that might have been imposed. Dr Hewson has recognised this. He has taken positive steps in a one-off increase of 25 per cent and with a promise to properly look at it, properly reassess the boundaries and properly do the job to try to compensate people living in remote and regional Australia when he gets into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand why Senator Collins chose to mislead the Senate with his comments. He is desperately trying to retain his job. He is in his present position only because he is Mr Hawke's mate. He was put into the Ministry because Mr Hawke stood on the factions and insisted that Senator Collins come in. He wanted him for some reason&mdash;I am not sure why. Why would anyone want somebody like Senator Collins on his team? But Mr Hawke did. Mr Hawke is in his last days, as everybody knows. The deals are being done and he will be out within the next few days&mdash;few hours, possibly. Someone might tell me whether he is still the leader now. Maybe I am even talking old hat at the moment. But he is certainly on the way out. It is just a question of hours, days or weeks. He will be gone, and I am very much afraid that poor old Senator Collins will go with him. He is a Minister only because of Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that Senator Collins would make any sort of claim to try to keep himself in the good books with Senator Richardson and the powers that be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The 1990-91 annual report of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust is the final report of this body, known more commonly as SFIT. It is the last annual report because as from 1 July 1991 SFIT became a government business enterprise, was renamed Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, or CFM, and was given the power to attract and invest funds from outside the public sector. So there was a fundamental change not only in the name but also in the structuring and operations of SFIT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SFIT was established in 1976 to manage and invest the employees' contributions to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund and, as such, invested on behalf of some 300,000 Commonwealth government employees. For a decade it operated under very strict and very conservative guidelines and, as a result, was regarded as a safe but relatively lacklustre, poor performer. In July 1986 the restrictions on SFIT's investment powers were lifted and it was given the freedom and flexibility to invest in the same way as its private sector counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that SFIT has become Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, or CFM, it has exclusive responsibility for investing funds for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. That scheme was closed to new contributors in July 1990 and replaced by the new Public Sector Superannuation scheme. At least for the next few years, the CFM has exclusive responsibility for investing the contributions of employees under those two schemes. It therefore has a captive clientele and a protected source of funds until 1995 when it will be opened up to greater competition but, until then, it has a position of market advantage, due solely to government patronage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SFIT's performance in 1990-91, its last year, unfortunately was below par. Its return to contributors was negative at minus 0.8 per cent after tax, which compares with a benchmark return for the sector as a whole in 1990-91 of plus 2.4 per cent. That disappointing result achieved by SFIT was due largely to the downturn in the property sector and the Fund's heavy asset weighting in that area. Its property portfolio showed a negative return of minus 16.2 per cent. Against that, the Fund's fixed interest portfolio returned 19.6 per cent, but that was not sufficient to bring SFIT's overall performance up to the benchmark. SFIT's five-year performance, however, has been creditable. Its average return to all shareholders for the five years ended June 1991 was 12.1 per cent, compared with a benchmark return of 12.3 per cent. It should be noted that SFIT's return was achieved with less volatility than the average, reflecting its generally prudent approach to investment management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is of the view that there is no reason why Commonwealth Funds Management should remain in the public sector, government owned and controlled. It is operating essentially in a financial market situation and it has many competitors in the private sector. We see no reason why it should remain in any way under the control or ownership of the Government. It has been part of the coalition's standing policy for some time now that the CFM should be privatised, and when we come into office it will be one of the government business undertakings that we will be privatising for more productivity, greater efficiency and better returns to contributors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Short has said, this is the last annual report of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. As he pointed out, the funds management area has been taken over by Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, and the trustee function of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme has been taken over by the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No. 2. The Australian Democrats thought that the legislation creating CFM was flawed in that it did not properly preclude total privatisation, although the problem has been rectified in the company's articles of association. I commend CFM for establishing the Commonwealth approved deposit fund to give public servants who leave the public sector the ability to roll over their accrued superannuation entitlements. The fund is an excellent one. It has no entry, exit or switching fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject I want to look at via this report today is that of the investment of superannuation funds, a topic which is of continuing interest. There are a few disturbing facts which emerge from the report. The after-tax investment return on $4.5 billion of assets being managed by the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust during 1990-91 was negative 0.8 per cent, and three of the four quarterly interest allocation rates for the year were zero. I do not think many honourable senators would be impressed with this result, and I am sure very few Commonwealth public servants are happy with it either. The sectoral returns are interesting&mdash;the worst performance being the property sector, with a negative 16 per cent return; and the second worse, a negative 8 per cent return on international equity investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are constantly told in this place&mdash;and Senator Short said something similar a few minutes ago&mdash;that the market must be allowed to decide the allocation of investment funds, and that any government involvement would be inefficient and would lead to lower returns for the members.

<PARA>The whole superannuation area is a growing public issue and a matter of growing public concern, and the report of the Commissioner for Superannuation covers some of those concerns. Firstly, I commend the Commissioner on the report. I want to raise the issue of the reasonable benefits limit and the way that some public servants, both State and Commonwealth, have this reasonable benefits limit issue dealt with, particularly by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think honourable senators on both sides of the chamber&mdash;and even in the middle, such as Senator Kernot&mdash;have probably, like my office, been inundated with complaints about the way in which the Insurance and Superannuation Commission deals with interim determinations and determinations. Coincidentally, a matter has been referred to me today by a former State employee who has had a terrible time trying to get an interim determination and a determination out of the Commission in relation to the reasonable benefits limit&mdash;which, of course, is a matter which the Commissioner for Superannuation deals with at some length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take the short time available to me to outline some of the worries about this matter, as well as deal with some broader concerns about the handling of determinations and interim determinations. The constituent I referred to resigned from his position in about June 1990. To this date, he has not been issued with a determination; he has been issued with an interim determination, which still has no force at law. He provided his tax file number to the ISC in October 1990. Up until 29 May this year he has advised it of his tax file number on a further three occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He received a letter from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission only this month seeking further information and asking him to provide his tax file number. Clearly, between October 1990 and December 1991 absolutely no action has been taken in relation to this determination or interim determination, which, to my mind, shows incredible maladministration in relation to this matter. That is just one person and I am sure other honourable senators know of many instances where this has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great tragedy of this situation is that it can cost taxpayers and people who are looking to have determinations on their reasonable benefits limit thousands and tens of thousands of dollars. I have had instances referred to me by a chartered accountant in Perth. This accountant has written hundreds of letters to the Commission seeking information from it in relation to reasonable benefits and seeking determinations. Even though this chap has written hundreds of letters to the Commission, he has received only one response in the last year. There appears to be a problem with tax agents having any official standing in front of the ISC. Another particular concern in Western Australia is the fact that the ISC has no representative in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we have only five minutes to deal with this matter, I will seek another opportunity to discuss it. I conclude by saying that the administration of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is something which deserves this Parliament's detailed consideration. I will be seeking, in the course of the next 24 hours, to have the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration conduct a detailed inquiry into the administration of this government body. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, through Worksafe Australia, plays a vital role in the education of Australian workers in safety procedures. Without denigrating in any way the important work that it does in the city areas, I would like to highlight what is happening in rural areas with regard to farm safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does mention farm safety. I am very conscious of the activities of various rural safety groups, and commend their work. But of the $2.2m invested last year in grants and awards, it seems that only one, that for $48,000 for a leaflet on pesticides in the farming industry, is rural related.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Country Womens Association is conducting farm safety workshops around New South Wales designed to highlight health and safety issues. Farming is not a safe occupation. Indeed, last year there was a dramatic increase in the number of deaths from tractor accidents, and authorities can give no reasons for these accidents. Tractor accidents, other accidents with machinery and pesticide handling are well-known hazards. What is perhaps less recognised is the number of farmers who have chronic hearing loss, chronic back problems and eye injuries. There would be few farmers who do not have one or a combination of these permanent injuries, aside from missing fingers or missing toes. The message on these problems needs to be better heard, better understood and more emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CWA workshops are educating rural women, who hopefully will relay the message to their families. In the meantime, it is the men who are attending accident and emergency departments in country hospitals in greater numbers than women, so there is a lot of work to be done to get the message back to the farm. I note that a survey of the north-west of New South Wales showed that from the ages of 10 to 35 men face a higher risk of injury than anyone else, and in the 20 to 24 age group 75 men were admitted suffering injuries compared to only 10 women during the study in November and December last year. It is an area that should be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see Senator Cook, the Minister for Industrial Relations, in the chamber. He has his well-taken photograph in this annual report. I hope he will give more thought to what is happening in country areas than this report has itemised. I think that country areas have dipped out somewhat in terms of recognition of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the women who are concerned with safety issues, especially because of the tough economic times we are experiencing at the moment. Farmers cannot afford any loss of production due to accidents. I commend this report to the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the complimentary remarks made by Senator Brownhill about the annual report of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. I think those remarks were well made. I appreciate the tenor of his criticisms about the Occupational Health and Safety Commission's role in promoting farm safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About two months ago, in answering a question in the Senate, I held up for display a pack called the `Farm Safety Kit', produced by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission for the purposes of distribution through the network of the Country Womens Association seminars that have been referred to, and dramatising and assisting in the promotion of safety and safe handling of plant, equipment and machinery on farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Brownhill has said is true. Farms in Australia do not necessarily have a high reputation universally as being safe places to work. There is a large number of fatalities on farms per head of the work force resulting from tractor accidents, and an undesirably large number at that. Modern farms are places where there is sophisticated plant, equipment and machinery. They are also sites for the use of quite complex chemicals and soil nutrients and enrichments. The handling of, and safe dealing with, those items are matters of concern from a safety point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission does maintain a chemicals register. It maintains a series of symbols which indicate the degree of safety required in the handling of particular chemicals, and maintains a watchdog role in advising the Government as to what chemicals may be allowed to be introduced and imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to delay the Senate, but I do think those points of explanation need to be made. It is a role the Commission respects; it is a role the Commission carries out; and, consistent with the huge demand on its services, particularly from heavy industry areas such as mining, it is a role it recognises should be played with regard to Australian farms. It is important to highlight these things but, with due respect to Senator Brownhill, to suggest the role is less than adequately fulfilled in the circumstances is a little unreasonable, particularly as in the series of cuts that are proposed by Dr Hewson's goods and services tax it is intended to abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and to remove entirely in one blow all the services that are available to people working in rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to highlight a number of aspects of the annual report of the Australian Trade Union Training Authority, particularly with regard to its financial position and what I consider an alarming or unhealthy trend. I am glad that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is in the chamber at this time because this matter comes under his portfolio. Going through some of the figures briefly, if we look at page 20 of the report we will find that from the previous financial year to this year the total equity of the Trade Union Training Authority has dropped from $17,155,631 to $16,678,792, a trend I would not have expected in terms of the input that has gone into this Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, if we go to the statement of activity for the year ended 30 June 1991, we find that the Government contribution in 1989-90 was about $8.945m. That was increased by $520,000 in the 1990-91 financial year to $9.465m. However, if we go to the bottom line in the statement, we find that the accumulated deficit has increased by about $477,000. When we allow for the increased contribution from public funds, or parliamentary appropriation, that represents an almost $1m turnaround;  that is, $520,000 of additional money plus $477,000. In an organisation which has such a heavy reliance on the public purse, I find that alarming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving to the year's training program which is set out on page 6 of the report, I bring to the Senate's attention the fact that, although additional funding of $520,000 has gone to the Authority&mdash;I know there is an explanation as to the changes in the types of courses offered&mdash;from 1989-90 to 1990-91, there has been a significant drop right across the board in the Trade Union Training Authority's activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that the number of courses has dropped from 2,993 to 2,159; the number of participants has dropped by nearly 40,000 from 86,259 to 47,199; the number of days of training has dropped; and the number of student days has also dropped. That trend, against the increased expenditure put into the Authority and the change of the bottom line, is very alarming and disconcerting, despite the explanation given in the report about there being shorter courses and different types of courses from the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless one reads this document very carefully&mdash;and I guess it is our responsibility to read it very carefully&mdash;one may not notice that the 1990-91 percentage increases have been compared with the 1988-89 figures. It took me some time to pick up what was going on. I do not complain that a year is compared with a year other than the previous year, but in those circumstances, in all fairness, the report should at least include a comparison with the previous year to give an easier to understand and more accurate picture of what is going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are discussing the Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill. This Bill amends the Australian Institute of Health Act 1973 to add to the existing functions of the Institute and to provide for a name change to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The Institute was established in 1984 as part of the Department of Health. In 1987 it was established as a statutory authority. The Opposition opposed the move to its being established as a statutory authority because we felt that such a move was unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the Institute were to research a wide range of health issues, with a particular focus on public health, social medicine, health statistics and health economics. The Bill before the Senate adds to the existing functions of the Australian Institute of Health. The new functions will include welfare functions as outlined in clause 4(d), functions such as: collecting, with the agreement of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and, if necessary, the Bureau's assistance, welfare related information and statistics; producing welfare related information and statistics; coordinating the collection and production of welfare related information and statistics by other bodies or persons; providing assistance for the collection and production of welfare related information, and so on. That clause outlines the new functions. The health functions of the Institute will remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will enable the Australian Institute of Health to take on the role of developing national welfare statistics focusing on the development, establishment and maintenance of national data sets relevant to policy planning and service delivery functions. The welfare statistics have only been collected on an ad hoc basis by various departments. The Bill also provides that the Minister, before giving directions to the Australian Institute of Health, must consult with the chairperson and the relevant State or Territory health, welfare or housing Minister. I understand that health and welfare Ministers have agreed that a memorandum of understanding will be developed jointly between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories outlining the rights and responsibilities of all parties in relation to the Institute's expanded role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have arisen as a result of an agreement by the Special Premiers Conference. Continuing consultation will occur between the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and the relevant State or Territory Minister. However, I note that the Bill removes nominees of the Public Health Administration of Australia and the Consumers Health Forum from the board of the Australian Institute of Health. I would be interested to hear from the Minister representing the Minister for Health, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), why this is so and what consultation, if any, took place regarding these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only justification given for the removal of these nominees from the board has been to keep the size of the board to a manageable level. I do not believe this is a justifiable reason. I certainly do not believe that it is excusable not to notify organisations that their positions on the board have been removed. In the committee stage of the Bill I foreshadow that I will be moving a number of amendments on behalf of the Opposition relating to the composition of the board of the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is same old story with this tired old Government. It does not consult. When it comes to the health portfolio, it does not matter whether we are dealing with pharmacists, general practitioners, physiotherapists, radiologists, pathologists or people working in nursing homes. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, will know that in this chamber we have been through Bills that have related to every one of those professions and that the constant complaint from every group is that the Ministers&mdash;the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples)&mdash;do not consult. That is the common complaint. Whichever group of health professionals or groups with an avid interest in the changes that relate to them we look at, there is inevitably no consultation. In this Bill there is no difference. A small Bill which should have zipped through this chamber comes across again as a failure of the Government due to Minister Howe, in this case, and his officers and Department not consulting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand why Ministers in health-related portfolios are so confrontational. If they were not, we would see a greater level of cooperation with the health professionals and the health related groups, and surely Australians would be better served by an approach of proper consultation. Surely we would get better outcomes if those departments and those responsible Ministers consulted with the relevant groups. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An allocation of $710 000 was made in the 1991-92 Budget to cover the cost of the enhancement of the Institute's role. This will increase to $1 670 283 in 1992-93, and $1 744 589 in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a good argument that the Institute should be part of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I do not mean that it should be subsumed by the Bureau, but that it should be an arm of it, concentrating on the collection, publication and so on of health, welfare and housing statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some concern about the possible duplication of resources and the possible costs as a result. It is interesting to examine the role of the Australian Institute of Health vis-a-vis that of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The functions of the ABS as set out in section 6(1) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975 include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . constitute the central statistical authority for the Australian Government and, by arrangements with the Governments of the States, provide statistical services for those Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>The functions of the ABS are set out clearly there. Page 3 of the explanatory memorandum notes the expanded role of the Australian Institute of Health in relation to the role of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expansion of the Institute's role into welfare statistics needs to be considered in relation to the role of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). That organisation is responsible for the coordination of all national statistics in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>subject to overall coordination by the ABS with respect to health statistics and welfare statistics. I have shortened that, but generally that is the meaning of the explanatory memorandum. It is probably helpful to clarify the role of the AIH and the ABS. The explanatory memorandum says the Institute:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . advises ABS on the health statistics to be collected and published by the Bureau. In general, the Institute is not involved in the original collection of data.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say the Institute:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consults with the ABS on development of statistical standards and classifications relevant to health and health services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this Bill, the explanatory memorandum says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Institute will be responsible for the development, coordination and production of national statistics relating to welfare services and housing assistance. The ABS will retain responsibility for the coordination and production of statistics relating to the general well-being of the Australian population. The Institute will consult with the ABS on development of statistical standards and classifications relevant to welfare services and housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not really matter what the outcome of the discussion about the roles of the Institute and the Bureau is. The main point is the importance of health statistics, no matter who collects them and disseminates them. The basic thrust of the Bill before us is to expand the Institute's role into welfare statistics. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for national welfare statistics has been recognised for many years.</PARA>
<PARA>Major reports calling for the development of national welfare statistics have included the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in 1975, the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty in 1975, the Bailey Task Force on Coordination in Welfare and Health in 1976 and the Baume report on evaluation in Australian health and welfare services from the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons that the Opposition supports the Bill. One interesting paper which has come out of the Institute was one on hospital utilisation and costs from 1982-83 to 1988-89, written by John Goss. I will not go into the discussion on hospital utilisation and costs since the inception of Medicare, but I found it interesting to read the last comment in the paper. The last paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We desperately need better measures of the health effects of our hospital systems, so that we can truly judge how to use our hospital and other health resources more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>That point supports another argument that I want to make during the committee stage of the Bill. The resources of the Institute would be well directed if it provided information to solve these resource problems. The program performance statements in 1991-92 outline the outcomes of the Institute for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of successful outcomes achieved by the Institute, and these include the following. The National Cancer Statistics Clearing House was established following agreement on a protocol between the Australian Association of Cancer Registries and the Institute. A national dataset detailing registration of new cancer cases and deaths for the period 1982-83 was established and publication of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cancer in Australia</EMPHASIS> in 1983 and 1984 is expected late in 1991. The World Health Organisation, after consultation with the Australian Government, designated the Institute as a WHO collaborating centre for classification of diseases. The Institute's National Nosology Reference Centre will coordinate training for introduction of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tenth Revision of International Classification of Diseases</EMPHASIS> throughout the Western Pacific region of the WHO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Australian Institute of Health assists governments in Australia to determine clear policy objectives. I would be interested to know whether the Australian Institute of Health has done any work on the level of bulkbilling and the incidence of overuse and overservicing. Audit report No. 32, 1990-91, found that the areas with the highest growth in medical outlays are those with the highest proportion of bulkbilling. But the Government dismissed the evidence by claiming that the Department had tried to mirror the results, could not do so, and said they were invalid. One does not have to look far to see the abundance of evidence that proves that bulkbilling leads to overuse and overservicing. I would be pleased to know whether the Institute sees it as its responsibility and, if so, whether it would undertake a study&mdash;if it has not already done so&mdash;on this subject. It would be very interesting to see the Minister and the Department dismiss the evidence that it produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advise the Minister that the coalition will be supporting the general thrust of this Bill, although we will have some amendments in the committee stage. I move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At end of motion, add ", but given the overwhelming evidence of a direct link between bulkbilling and the overuse and oversupply of medical services, the Senate congratulates the Coalition parties for adopting a health policy in its `Fightback' proposals which abolishes bulkbilling except for pensioners, health care card holders and people with disabilities".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night in the debate on the Sales Tax Amendment Bill (No. 3) I was encouraged to speak about the Opposition's health policy and was urged to restrain myself because there was only faint relevance, but with that amendment by Senator Patterson I think I am licensed to go, am I not? But the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) should not worry, I will try not to go on this issue, except to say, of course, that I will be loud in my protestations about the virtues of such an amendment. I will be loud in opposing that addition, and I probably do have the opportunity now to state a number of reasons why I should not congratulate anybody who thought up the Hewson package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turning firstly to the substance of the legislation, the Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill 1991. It is a very interesting and timely piece of legislation which indicates that we are looking at ways to further the collection, analysis and publication of the statistics so critical, not only in the field of welfare services and housing assistance, but also in the area of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have read the report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, which I chaired, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">What Price Care?</EMPHASIS> would know that we raised the difficulties associated with health statistics. One statistic which is often waved around this place relates to the curious problem of the number of people on public hospital waiting lists for elective surgery. It is still very difficult to get an accurate fix on how many people are on those waiting lists. This is a concern that shows how important this legislation and the amendment are. It is another justification for the establishment of the Institute of Health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Commonwealth Government is to contribute funds to the States to enable them to provide services to the Australian people, the States need to be accountable. We need to know whether adequate services are being provided to public hospitals to enable them to meet the needs of those who need elective surgery. It is easy to come in here and, with very little evidence, wave bits of paper and insist that there are 100,000 people on waiting lists at public hospitals around Australia. There is certainly considerable evidence that those figures are, at best, very rubbery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the Opposition's health policy, one finds that the Opposition has now assessed that 60,000 people are on waiting lists. That is a remarkable drop. The Opposition is saying that in two years of this Government there has been a reduction of 40,000. In the run-up to the 1990 election the Opposition said that there were 100,000 people on the waiting list. Minister Blewett, who was the Minister for Community Services and Health at the time, did argue that in fact there were, by more accurate reckonings, 70,000 on the waiting lists. The Opposition and particularly Mr Shack were made to feel very stupid about their health policy in particular because of that error and that outrageous and unsubstantiated claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out, the Opposition declares that the waiting list figure is now 60,000. That figure is still no more accurate than it was before, because we still cannot conclude precisely that 60,000 is an accurate assessment. We can say that it is more likely to be 60,000 or 70,000 than 100,000. I think there is now an agreement that the number of people on hospital waiting lists is not 100,000, as was claimed by the Opposition until so recently. Certainly, the Opposition's policy now claims that the figure is 60,000. So it is encouraging that we have at least been able to bid down the number of people on waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson pointed out the importance of obtaining hard data in the area of health statistics, particularly hospital statistics. I concur entirely with that point. If we are to move to a case mix in hospital care, we need to recognise that the equations are very complex and difficult. As a result, we will have to analyse hard statistics that will need to be provided by hospitals. For example, private hospitals contribute very little towards the cost of educating nurses, allied health professionals, medical undergraduates, recent graduates and post-graduates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education costs make up part of the outlays of large public hospitals but they form almost no part of the outlays of a private hospital. I understand that some private hospitals are now becoming involved in some medical and nursing teaching but it is a modest sum compared with the contribution made by large public hospitals. If we were to undertake a case mix comparison on the cost of performing an appendectomy in a public hospital compared with the cost in a private hospital, we would need to take into account such things as the education costs of that public hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to take out a number of other things. Very few private hospitals, for example, have a morgue. Properly, we would not want every hospital in the country to have a morgue&mdash;for both the grim factors and an oversupply of unnecessary services. A number of other things have been and continue to be provided by public hospitals: for example, a toxic waste incinerator. Those are some of the areas of service provision that need to be properly assessed or accurately quantified so that they can be removed from the case mix equation. After we do some of that, we might then be able to make a more accurate assessment of costs. For all of those reasons, I entirely agree that the importance of adequate health statistics is a vital concern to the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we support the original legislation and these amendments. The amendments do not do much by way of extending the data for health statistics, but I do not mind taking the opportunity to argue their justification. It is important that we see the inclusion of welfare and housing assistance statistics in such an institute&mdash;a significant, reliable, recognised institute of data of the sort that can only be of assistance to the community and to government in the planning and the funding that is necessary to see adequate, appropriate, proper and, I would also add, equitable provision of services to people of this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substance of the legislation is fine. I do not think there will be much dispute by anybody in this chamber about the significance of this legislation and there will be, I should have thought, large support for it. What seems to be the point of disagreement is how the board of this new Institute, if we are to call it a new institute, shall be constituted. In the committee stage, I will be moving amendments that have been circulated in this place in my name. </PARA>

It may be, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I will need your assistance in actually getting it right when the time comes to do it all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very critical, if we are to have the collection of data of the sort that gives governments in particular the evidence with which they then justify a significant allocation of funding to service provision&mdash;that service provision now extending to the welfare and housing areas&mdash;that we have adequate consumer representation on that board, not just in an advisory capacity as was proposed but also at the actual decision making level. We all know the difference between being advisers and being decision makers. I do not think that needs to be argued in this place. It is also quite clear that the significance of a consumer voice is sometimes lost but, indeed, it ought to be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now facing in this place an agreement, I suspect, that consumer voices should be heard at the board level and that consumers ought be on the board. What we now have to deal with&mdash;I think Senator Lees and Senator Patterson will agree&mdash;is what we define as a consumer, because the consumer has gone from being a representative of the users or consumers of health services as, for example those represented by the Consumer Health Forum or ACOSS, a body that is reputable and a long recognised speaker on behalf of the people involved with welfare. I refer also to similar and allied housing institutions on behalf of users of housing, representatives of the AMA, the Australian Hospital Association and the Australian Private Hospital Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some might properly argue that hospitals are great consumers of health dollars. Indeed, they certainly are. I do not have a dictionary right to hand, but I understand that most of us would know what we mean by a consumer and we would not, first of all, think that a consumer meant a relevant professional organisation. They may be properly involved in the collection and provision of statistical data, but I do not believe that they would be, in any common understanding, defined as consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the case put by the Australian Hospital Association and the Australian Private Hospital Association for one or other of those two to have a representative on the board is not without some power because I take the point that hospitals are going to be very significant players in the health statistics. Indeed, I have just made that case in terms of case mix or hospital waiting lists. It is interesting that if we go this way we may find a large number of the funds directed towards how many dollars of the health budget are allocated to hospitals. It is a very significant amount, and quite clearly hospitals could argue the case that they should have a say in what kind of data is collected, how much, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could also be the case though, that, as such an amount is consumed by hospitals and there is such a need for data about the health of the community and the provision of services outside of hospitals, we may even see a case arguing for representatives of public health services, representatives of general practitioners who provide services outside of hospitals, and so on. I think a very good case could be made for that if one wanted to argue that way; but I do not find it convincing. The fact that hospitals are going to be critically part of health statistics does not justify the representation on the board of either the Australian Private Hospital Association or the Australian Hospital Association. It is my understanding at this time that they would not be what I would call a consumer, nor what the Government would call a consumer. But I am not quite sure what will be finally concluded on that matter. I would want to argue that they are not commonly known as consumers. But in arguing that they should not be included under the heading of consumer representation on the board, I would hope no-one would be overlooking such organisations in collecting the data, and the close negotiation with them would certainly be part of any valid institute work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we cannot afford to have included, on a functioning board, people who would have some valid claim for their area of involvement in the provision of health services in this country; it would become unworkably large. What on earth would justify the AMA as apart from, for example, the College of General Practitioners?  What on earth would justify the AMA as apart from the Doctors Reform Society or salaried medical officers?  I do not believe we can start arguing for the AMA. If it were the case that we wanted to argue for one doctor representative for the medical profession, I think we could actually have a different sort of argument, but I do not believe that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Opposition, whose amendments have only recently been provided, is proposing that there be a representative from the AMA. I argue that that is not a representative group of medical practitioners. The AMA has a wonderful history of being particularly able to state its own case. It is now widely recognised that the AMA does not speak for many doctors in this country. It certainly does not speak for the salaried medical officers, who have their own union and their own representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill should be amended in a general way and should not restrict consumers by naming an institution and requiring that only representatives of that institution or organisation can provide a consumer representative from the areas of health, welfare, housing or a specific research area. On behalf of the Government, I will be moving an amendment to include representation of consumers of health services, welfare services, housing assistance services and consumers with research ability. We are making sure that those consumer voices will be heard on the board level, where the decisions are being made. That is a point on which we are in agreement with the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Government is minded to support either hospital or the medical representation, as proposed by the Opposition. I think they will best represent themselves by collecting statistics and data in a sensible way. It makes good sense for people in the health arena not to overlook public and private hospitals or the Australian Medical Association when collecting the necessary statistics and evidence under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the same applies in the areas of welfare and housing, both of which are new areas. I shall certainly be watching very closely the consequences of bringing them under the one institute. I think it makes for a very large beast. I am a bit concerned that its largeness and the extension of its work may lead to a modification of the focus of its data collection. I would not like to see the health area watered down in any way or find that the welfare and housing statistics are insufficient because these areas have been brought together. I will be watching that very closely. My colleague Senator Patterson, who is across the chamber, is in agreement that we should watch this closely so that there is not insufficient collection of data under such a large institute, as this will no doubt become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that we finally have recognition of the importance of the collection of this data at the national level and it promises significant and exciting possibilities. It needs to be watched very closely, because it will be very large. From the information we glean we may want to modify the way the Institute is designed in the future. We would like to know how it meets its task or the difficulties it confronts, if any. All that being said and agreed, in large part, our problem is to define a consumer, but consumer representation on that board is not in disagreement. I hope that in the course of the passage of the legislation we can agreeably work that out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As previous speakers have noted, the Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill 1991 introduces a number of changes which expand the functions of the Australian Institute of Health enabling it to collect, analyse and publish statistics not only in the health area but also in the areas of welfare services and housing assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to this legislation, the institute's activities have been restricted to the health field, and the Government sees this expansion as the first step in developing and strengthening national welfare statistics. We certainly hope it is right in that. This change in the institute's role recognises the need for accurate and reliable national welfare data and, as the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) noted when introducing the Bill, there have been several calls over the past 15 years for the development of a process to collect and analyse this sort of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This expansion comes at a time of significant change in the delivery of health, welfare, disability and housing services throughout the country. It gives the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, as it is now going to be known, a potentially vital role to play in the reform of Commonwealth-State relations. I do not think there is any dispute here of the fact that there is a very great need to collect statistics in these areas. If decisions with far-reaching consequences are going to be taken about the delivery of welfare and health services, then it is obvious that these must be based upon accurate information. There is also a need to evaluate the success or otherwise of ongoing programs and to determine whether or not the outcomes of programs are what we expect or, indeed, what we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this sounds, and is, perfectly sensible, but much depends on whether the Government actually takes any notice of the data that is collected by the Institute. We would all agree&mdash;certainly some of us on this side of the chamber&mdash;that this Government has been particularly good at setting up projects to collect and analyse data, at considerable expense to the taxpayer, and then totally ignoring the data that has been collected if its implications do not support what the Government is proposing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A prime example of this technique that exists at the moment is the national health strategy which the Government&mdash;in particular, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe&mdash;has done a great job of ignoring, despite its being the most comprehensive analysis of the health system ever undertaken in this country. There is the Australian Institute of Family Studies, a body that consistently turns out excellent statistical and analytical work only to see its funding base eroded year after year and its findings ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is whether or not enhancing the role of the Institute is necessarily the best way to go about collecting national welfare statistics. I know views have been expressed in some quarters that strengthening the role of the Australian Bureau of Statistics may have been a better way to go. However, I do not want to canvass those issues at this point in time and I will not be pursuing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, we welcome the new role for the Institute. It is highly desirable that we collect and understand data about child-care services, particularly in relation to the welfare of children; aged care services; services for people with disabilities; and housing needs. There has been an absence of quality national statistics in these areas for quite some time. I see the Institute's new tasks as being a very positive step in developing and understanding welfare and housing needs and the needs particularly for specific service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been noted by previous speakers, the one major concern we all have about this Bill is the change in the composition of the board. Until now, there have been 12 members of the board consisting of the chairperson; the Director of the Institute; three members nominated by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, that is, the State and Federal health Ministers; the Australian Statistician; the Secretary of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services; three members nominated by the Minister&mdash;and, at present, these are two academics, Peter Scotton and Bettina Cass, and a senior journalist, Gay Davidson; a member nominated by the Public Health Association; and a member nominated by the Consumers Health Forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These last two organisations have represented the interests of consumers and community-based service providers in the health area. Under this legislation as it stands, these two organisations have been dumped from the board and I think we must ask the Minister, when we get into the committee stage of this Bill, why this has been done. I might add that when my office rang the Consumers Health Forum and the Public Health Association seeking their views on the Bill, both organisations told us that they had yet to be formally advised by the Minister or his Department of the decision to remove them from the board, although I understand their representatives did have an idea that it was a possibility&mdash;they were aware of discussions&mdash;and it was a possibility that they had vigorously opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I was not, because unfortunately this failure to consult key interest groups is something that we have been coming across time and time again. Indeed, in a number of recent pieces of legislation that have passed through this chamber it became very apparent that there had been no significant discussion with organisations which were adversely affected by the changes proposed. It represents political and bureaucratic arrogance, I suggest, of the most appalling kind. It is behaviour that should be challenged on every possible occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, the two organisations concerned have taken seriously both their responsibilities on the board and their obligations to keep their members in touch with what is happening at the Institute. Dumping them off the board without even the courtesy of an advisory letter illustrates pretty clearly how highly the Minister rates community based service providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Bill, the Government is proposing a different board composition in accordance with the new role of the Institute. It was planned that the new board would consist of only 11 members: the chairperson; a director; one member nominated by the AHMAC; the Australian Statistician; the Secretary to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services; a representative of the State housing departments; a member nominated by the Standing Committee of Social Welfare Administrators; three members nominated by the Minister; and a staff member of the Institute elected by the staff. Honourable senators should note that there is no provision for any community or consumer representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, when we look at what the new look Institute will be doing, we see that many of its welfare related functions are likely to impact directly on service providers and that there surely will be a need for input and, indeed, as Senator Crowley noted, a need for decision making as the board comes to deal with its new functions&mdash;that is, decision making by those organisations which are most affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new board is loaded with bureaucrats and persons with vested interests in following political and departmental agendas. Those agendas are frequently vastly different from the interests and agendas of consumers and service providers&mdash;especially those operating in the community or charitable sectors. In fact, in view of the nature of the new responsibilities the Institute has been given, there is a sound argument for not only retaining the existing level but also actually increasing community representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Australian Democrats proposed amendments and enlisted the support of the Opposition, the Minister apparently had a number of excuses as to why he would not be continuing the practice of community representation on the Institute board. Firstly, he is apparently planning to set up an Australian Health and Welfare Information Council as an advisory body to the Institute. We were told that this would include various key organisations in the relevant fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the fact that the structure of this body is not finalised&mdash;we really do not have any details as to what is actually being proposed&mdash;it relegates the community sector to simply an advisory capacity, rather than its having any power or any say in the decision-making process. It ignores the importance of the presence of independent community based voices with direct responsibility on the Institute board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister claims that the new Council will have a vital input into the Institute's decision making processes, but there is certainly no legislative mechanism for that to occur. There is no guarantee that the Council will be anything more than a little side issue, a talk-shop, with absolutely no influence whatsoever over what the Institute actually does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument seemed to be that, if additional members were placed on the board, it would become too large and unwieldy. That is one argument I really cannot buy at all. For example, if one representative from each of the health, housing and welfare sectors were to be included on the board&mdash;which is what we are proposing&mdash;it would comprise 14 members. Even if all the foreshadowed amendments get up here today, the board will still have only 17 members. There are many private organisations, non-government, community based and corporate organisations which have 17 or more members on their boards and which function perfectly adequately. I fail to see why the Institute would experience any difficulty&mdash;especially when we weigh any possible difficulties against the advantages of having direct access to the views and expertise of those relevant sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another view that has been put forward is that it was not possible to fix upon one representative from each sector because of rivalries between organisations. I find that argument quite extraordinary. It is very clear to all that there are key peak bodies which are easily recognisable in each of the three sectors concerned. There may be rivalries and disagreements within those sectors, but surely it is up to the organisations in those fields to truly sort those matters out and to truly represent those sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will be moving amendments to have a peak body from each sector nominate a member to the board. We are suggesting that those bodies should be the Consumers Health Forum in the health area; National Shelter in the housing area; and, of course, ACOSS in the welfare sector. I have discussed this Bill at length with Senator Patterson. I am very pleased that not only will the Opposition be supporting our amendments, but also Senator Patterson will be moving an amendment to ensure that the Public Health Association continues to be a member of the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put forward the Consumers Health Forum because we are satisfied that it has the broad-based membership necessary to fulfil the role of representing the community health sector. It has a long record of advocating on behalf of consumers in the health system. In addition, its membership covers a very wide spectrum of interests which enable it to look beyond the narrow `health only' focus&mdash;a view, I suggest, that will be crucial to the success of the Institute's new responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACOSS is obviously an appropriate choice for the board. Regardless of whether, at some points in time, the Opposition and the Government have disagreed with ACOSS's public views, I think all would agree that it is the peak body for the welfare sector and it is certainly well placed to provide input from a large range of service providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National Shelter is the peak body representing housing services. The community housing sector has particular concerns and issues that would best be addressed by specific representation. I would also point out that this organisation has taken an active and well informed interest in changing Commonwealth-State relations and their impact on housing assistance programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we must acknowledge the Australian Medical Association, which has had a major input into particular community health issues such as alcohol consumption and tobacco use. Given the nature of the Institute's work, I think it is important that, as the Association represents a significant group of primary service providers, it be given the opportunity to ensure that the Institute has access to a very extensive data collection base. As well, I believe the Association is in a position to alert the Institute to important basic primary health issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Senator Crowley has some concerns with regard to the possibility of hospitals being represented, but in her speech she also noted particular issues relating to the hospitals and the fact that they have such a large percentage of the health budget in their corner. Therefore, I think it is appropriate, with the way we are now looking at restructuring and access from a wide variety of different points of view and different interests, that hospitals be included.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will see a board that has 17 members, and I do not believe that at any point in time that will be found to be in any way unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Government initially found the Democrat proposals unacceptable, I understand that Senator Crowley, on behalf of the Government, is now putting up several amendments which, on their own, would ensure broader representation. I do have a certain amount of cynicism about these proposals, not least because I am well aware that the only reason they have been put up is that the Government has realised that our amendments will be successful, as will the Opposition amendments, and I believe the Government is now trying to salvage something out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not the reason why I will be opposing them. I am simply not satisfied with the Government amendments. I think they are far too broad and I think they will give the Minister considerable discretion as to which group or which representatives of which group he accepts or does not accept from the nominations. I believe the amendments that the Democrats and the Opposition are putting forward will be less open to manipulation and, therefore, I would prefer to stick with those. The Democrats' amendments will assist in avoiding the Institute becoming just another bureaucratic exercise, operating to assist governments and departments, without having much to offer the very people its data collection is ultimately supposed to be benefiting. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley spoke of the different representatives who should be on the board of this Australian Institute of Health. If we kept appointing people from particular interest groups, there would be more people in that Institute than there are in this building. I thought that we were the representatives of the people and that is why we are here, rather than putting on representatives from this group and that group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Crowley's argument about salaried doctors, specialists, general practitioners, public health doctors and so on, the fact of the matter is that more than 21,000 doctors are members of the Australian Medical Association. They actually pay about $500 to be members of that Association. As a generalisation, one-third are salaried doctors, one-third are general practitioners and one-third are specialists. So the AMA is an overall representative body. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Doctors Reform Society claims to have 1,000 members. I am not certain they are all doctors.

The argument that the AMA does not represent doctors is totally spurious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument that Senator Crowley brought forward was to do with waiting lists and why the coalition has reviewed the figures. The fact is&mdash;Senator Crowley is correct in this&mdash;that it is difficult to quantify waiting lists. This Government has, by its differential lowering of rebates, stimulated the development of day surgery centres. In fact, in the past two years since those figures were tabulated by the Opposition, 46 free-standing day surgery units have been established in Australia which deal with minor surgery and have changed quite markedly the number of people kept on waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not think of the quantity; let us think of the qualitative aspects of waiting lists, of the people who are waiting for coronary bypass surgery at Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane who have to wait so long that the mortality rate is increased. Let us think of the elderly patients who are waiting for more than two years at the Royal Brisbane Hospital for hip replacements, who are putting up with the pain and the problems associated with gross arthritic changes in their hips; the people who have been waiting longer for knee replacements and other joint replacements; or the people who are waiting for other major surgery. These people may not be large in number, but these waiting times represent immense personal agony and prolonged morbidity for the people who suffer from these diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Crowley was with me yesterday at the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health. Professor Bob Douglas has collated the responses of the 2,000 doctors from all over Australia who were asked to comment on the problems affecting general practice. They were not members of the AMA; they were not particularly members of the Doctors Reform Society. There were 2,000 doctors who took the trouble to reply to a questionnaire comprising 120 detailed questions, and those replies were analysed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that figured most was the necessity for the abolition of bulkbilling because this was seen as the major cause of the development of entrepreneurial clinics and the development of poor quality medicine in Australia. The second most important figure shown was the number of doctors who were practising in our community, again stimulated by Senator Crowley's Government because of the unrestricted entry of overseas trained doctors to the detriment of the ability of Australian children to go into medical schools here. Senator Crowley's Government has a lot to answer for. I believe that the amendment moved by the Opposition is to be commended because, at least by advocating the development of the Fightback proposals, the coalition's health policy goes a long way towards restoring quality in health care in this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley has mentioned amendments to put consumer representatives on the board of this Institute. That will give consumers input into the Institute, but deny the medical profession any input at all. I believe that that is totally wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley has said that the AMA should not be included. It was on the interim board of the Institute and it was taken off. Senator Crowley has said that it should not be on the board because, after all, the AMA does not represent doctors. She asks why other groups, such as the Doctors Reform Society, should not be on the board. I can explain to Senator Crowley the difference between the AMA and the Doctors Reform Society. As Senator Herron has already said, one-third of the AMA's members constitute the medical profession, and are paid members of hospital staff. The Doctors Reform Society claims that it has 1,000 members&mdash;it never tells us the exact number&mdash;and has primarily doctors who are paid members of hospital staff.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State hospitals are in dire trouble. Every honourable senator knows the problems that their State hospitals have in getting funds. The Government has continually knocked back or cut the money which goes to hospitals. We know that the Government has closed beds; we know how many vacant beds there are in public hospitals; we know that the capital expenditure has ceased; we know the dreadful state that the hospitals are presently in; we know that their equipment is at a disastrous level, that there is very little modern equipment; we know, as I have said, that the people are dissatisfied with it. The State hospitals try to cope with this lack of funding in a variety of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a letter which was given in evidence to Senator Crowley's Committee. The letter explains how this particular hospital coped with the lack of funds and tried to provide some sort of service to its patients. The letter is sent by the Medical Director of Williamstown Hospital to the Executive Director, the Director of Nursing and the Admissions Clerk. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial position of the Hospital has deteriorated throughout the month of January and the over-run is now in the order of $385,000.00 This amount has to be recovered before the end of the financial year. In particular, the Visiting Medical Officers' payments are presently $92,000.00 over budget with pathology and radiology payments also over budget. These over-runs reflect a private/public mix of 66.2% public patients to date&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, only 66.2 per cent public patients in that hospital to date. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an over-run of 6.2%. It is therefore necessary to adjust the number of public patients admitted for the balance of the financial year to the level budgeted for.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, that 66.2 per cent of public patients has to be brought down to 60 per cent, for the financial reasons of this public hospital. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In consequence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>just get a load of this!&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all future elective bookings of public patients will be on the basis that any number in excess of one public patient per elective list will require approval from the Medical Director. This restriction will not be introduced for patients for whom requests for admission have been received as of today the 23rd February, 1988 but will be active for all requests for admission received after today. The restriction will remain in place until future notice.</PARA>
<PARA>Because the public hospital had an over-run, because of its budget, because it had too many public patients, too many Medicare patients&mdash;that is, 66.2 per cent, instead of the  budgeted 60 per cent&mdash;the Executive Director ordered that there be no more than one public patient on an elective surgery list until private patients were brought into the hospital to fill those elective lists. Is that not a dreadful situation? Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you would agree that public hospitals should be kept primarily for Medicare patients. But this hospital was able to cope with its funding under Medicare only if 40 per cent of its patients were private and thus paying. Is that not an appalling situation? The elderly, the pensioners and the poor had to be put off. The hospital allowed only one public patient &mdash;from among the poor, the pensioners, et cetera&mdash;per elective list. All the rest had to be private patients. That is how that particular hospital coped to try to get its funding.

We have been saying to the Government ever since it brought in this rubbishy sort of legislation that if it kept on down this track we would get to this stage. Under our policy, we will expand that and entitle and encourage people to privately insure for their hospital treatment. An income of $25,000 a year is a relatively middle income.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a 15 per cent discount.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they wish to. What Senator Herron is doing as a member of a party which is given to the marketplace and to the idea of competition between various sectors, particularly in the provision of services, is taking away the capacity of some GPs to offer that competitive stimulus to the provision of medical services and health care to the Australian people. I find that quite remarkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Herron must also admit that the proposal is linked to the fact that his Party is encouraging people not only to pay, as they must, their Medicare levy, 1.25 per cent of their taxable income, but also to take out private insurance to cover the fee that they will pay for consultation with their GP, because that GP's fee will be set at the AMA schedule fee. Because there is no bulkbilling competition from GPs people will find that they will have to insure in order to be able to meet the $31 they will have to pay on the deal between the AMA and the private health insurance funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what the Opposition policy is about is the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars to GPs from the pockets of patients who present themselves for primary health care and attention at their GP, using the AMA schedule fee, via the private health insurance funds. That is a simple description of what is proposed and therefore the Government will not be supporting the second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the reformation of the charter of the Australian Institute of Health is an important step in ensuring that we have an Australia-wide capacity, well supported by all governments&mdash;the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories&mdash;to collate necessary statistics in order to permit rational policy making so far as the provision and funding of services are concerned, whether it be in the health, welfare or housing fields. In fact, this is one of the very good results to come out of the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference, where the heads of government agreed that there would be great good served by the collation of such data Australia-wide&mdash;nationally consistent data&mdash;and the Australian Institute of Health will be given that expanded role. I believe that health and welfare Ministers, as recently as 6 September 1991, agreed on that expanded role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we can have confidence in the Institute. It has already been involved in the development of a national minimum dataset for institutional health care, made progress towards a national health labour force data collection covering a number of health professionals, made progress towards a national cancer statistics clearing house and an inventory of Australian health data collections, and has initiated the development of a national health information agreement. That sort of track record gives us confidence in the capacity and the ability of the Institute to provide nationally useful statistics over the much wider area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very important to emphasise&mdash;and I know this is of particular and genuine interest to Senator Patterson&mdash;that, in the collection of welfare services and housing assistance data, privacy and confidentiality requirements must be met and will be met. The Institute's legislative framework&mdash;its statutory charter&mdash;already provides for the confidentiality of all such records, and of course there are no amendments to change or modify those particular provisions. They have proved to be adequate safeguards and they are certainly necessary. I am quite sure that the Parliament would not give to the Institute the tasks it is giving it without the assurance of those statutory safeguards and the knowledge that they have worked well to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, some concern has been expressed about the proposed Institute board structure. I understand that all sides of the chamber now&mdash;including Senator Crowley&mdash;have made contributions to the debate in terms of there being a necessity for consumers' representatives or the representatives of various groups to find a place on the board, and the Government can see the merit in those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Lees and the Australian Democrats have consistently made these submissions, and there is merit in what they have put forward. I must say that I find greater attraction in Senator Crowley's proposals, for reasons that would perhaps be better expressed at the committee stage. I do believe that Senator Crowley made a very eloquent and sensible plea for the ability of the Minister to make available for the board, for the management of this Institute, a wider range of his or her ministerial nominees to provide for a much broader participation of those who have knowledge and might be affected by the collection of these statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government will indicate its preferred support for Senator Crowley's amendment, but of course will be open to ensure that at the end of the committee stage there will be a proper representation from various groups that were nominated by Senator Crowley. In one way or another they should find a place on the board. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I did not want to interrupt Senator Tate as this has nothing to do with him. As I was watching this debate on the television, I thought I heard you make a comment which, in a private conversation, you have confirmed is correct. You made reference to Senator Crowley's interjecting and then said in an audible voice, `Sounds like Macdonald', `She's carping like Macdonald', or something like that. That remark coming from the Chair was rather offensive to me.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>This amendment deals with the difficulty that I believe the Institute will confront, as I think has already been evidenced in the amendments circulated to this Bill; that is, representatives of special bodies, selected organisations, will be nominated directly to the board. That carries with it a necessary restriction on the groups from whom the nominations to represent consumers of health, welfare, housing, and public health research institutes can be drawn. I move this amendment because I believe it is of value not to specify a restricted list of organisations; secondly, to provide the prospect then of a wider group of people with the expertise&mdash;that is, to represent consumers&mdash;whose nomination could come from one or many bodies, from health, welfare, housing or public health research; and those names going through to the Minister allows the Minister to make a choice before making a nomination to the board. In this way I think we extend the range of people from whom the nomination can be drawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We give the Minister some options from whom he or she can make the choice. We also avoid the difficulty of listing particular organisations as the only organisations which can provide the nomination. I believe that is a very good policy because it is quite clear that in the not too distant future we could be assured that other bodies, properly constituted, properly representing consumer interests, will be clamouring for their place on this board. Why would we justify the representation from consumer group A and not consumer group B? We know consumer groups do emerge from time to time, validly constituted and properly representing consumer interests. I feel this amendment actually addresses the difficulty of restricting nominations to the board from specified organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this amendment will provide more options and a wider range of prospective talent for the board and will provide to the Minister the opportunity to make a selection from those nominations so that the board will be enriched by drawing from a wider base. We also avoid the trap of listing specified organisations and, therefore, de facto excluding any other organisation which may properly and validly provide the same kind of person, able to do the same kind of task and adequately represent consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the constitution of the Institute to include welfare and housing creates a very big challenge for the people on the board. They will have to make significant decisions about the research that will be done, the direction of the resources and the allocation of funds to one part of research as opposed to any other. I believe that the Institute, on behalf of consumers, will be more adequately served if the consumer representation is drawn from a wider, rather than a more restrictive, pool. For all those reasons, I argue the case for the amendment as written. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that it does not include representation from the AMA, from any other doctors organisation or from the private or public hospitals arena. I commented on that in my speech during the second reading debate. I think the valid contribution that representatives from those organisations will make is undeniable. That is not the point. We are here looking at the representation on the Institute's board and the campaign&mdash;particularly the campaign that led to my amendment, I am sure Senator Lees's amendment, and very possibly Senator Patterson's amendment&mdash;by consumer groups for their continuing representation on a board&mdash;</PARA>

I think it was by a Democrat amendment that that change was actually put in place. I cannot insist that that is right, but I think the sentiment was there for consumer presence on the board. I believe that consumer presence has been more than sufficient to justify its continuation.

I do not believe there is a case made for them not to be involved, certainly not under the campaign by consumers for consumer representation. I argued before that, while hospitals are very large consumers of health dollars, that is not the colloquial or commonsense understanding of `consumer' or `consumer representative' that I am addressing in proposing this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a case may be made for the AMA or the private and public hospitals, I think it should be separate from the campaign for consumer representation. I also think that if we are looking to have a board of such a size as to be effective, we have to set some limits on its size. I have said in my speech that I will be looking very closely at how this board and the Institute function. I certainly will want to hear evidence that the board of the size I propose&mdash;a board of 15 people&mdash;is not too large to be effective. </PARA>

Therefore, I will be opposing this amendment and moving the Democrat amendments. Those amendments will specify which particular organisations are on the board and leave it up to them as to who they choose, and I believe that they can be trusted to choose who the specific representative is.

But, in fact, that `nominated by the Minister' is being used by Senator Lees to suggest it is a ministerial nomination. Indeed, it is only so to the extent that the Minister is able to nominate one of those people being put to him by the relevant consumer body or bodies. So it is not, in the ordinary sense, a ministerial nomination. It is a nomination by the consumer organisation itself, which is very much in sympathy with what Senator Lees is proposing, and in the end that nomination is ratified by ministerial approval. But the Minister may have more to say about Senator Lees's difficulties. </PARA>

For example, in the housing area, if the National Shelter and the National Youth Coalition for Housing put forward names, that would give the Minister an opportunity to choose somebody who should represent that interest.

But, for the record, I note that it is a very new piece in the history and I will be watching that very closely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Bank Integration Bill 1991 is to enable the final processing of the removal of the distinction between savings banks and trading banks, which commenced with the Banking Legislation Act 1989. At the outset, in handling this Bill for the Opposition, I express very real concerns which, unfortunately, are held by a great many Australians about banks and the banking industry, about banking policies and practices, and about the need to set up a more rewarding banking environment for customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failed, leaderless Hawke Labor Government is a captive of our nation's nineteenth century industrial culture. It has missed the chance to create history by its failure to break the mould of our sleepy industrial and commercial structures. While the Government cannot be held totally responsible for its inheritance, it must be blamed for not seriously tackling problems which have become blindingly obvious in the past decade, especially problems evident in the banking industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such concerns have been reiterated only recently, with the tabling of the so-called Martin report on banking. The report, as predicted, made sweeping proposals to ensure that banks were more accountable to their customers and to expose them to more competition from foreign banks. The report was critical of all of the major banks for their involvement in foreign currency loans which, as we know, were a focal feature of the deregulated financial market during the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the conclusions of the report is that many of the banks have attempted to portray themselves as the compliant victims of borrowers determined to obtain foreign currency loans. This is difficult to accept because competition was a force driving banks to offer the loans, with the quality of bank advice on the risks being variable, depending on the experience and the judgment of bank staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very real concerns which many individuals and business operators in this country have is the fear of bankruptcy. For many, it is not merely a financial issue; it is an emotional issue which conjures up images of stress, harassment, social disgrace and dishonour&mdash;and well it might be a concern in the disastrous economic environment created by this failed Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest statistics for bankruptcy in our community highlight the extent of pain and suffering caused through bankruptcies under this destabilised and destabilising Government. On the 1991 September quarter figures, bankruptcies have increased by a staggering 72.2 per cent over the previous September quarter. They are up nearly 20 per cent on the 1991 June quarter. Between June and September of this year well over 4,700 people went broke, as if the 4,000-plus who went broke between March and June was not bad enough. In simple terms, this means that in just the last three months 4,764 extra families have been directly affected by bankruptcy&mdash;10 families every hour of the working day. Indirectly, thousands of employees and their families are now experiencing financial problems due to redundancies and retrenchments attributable to bankruptcies. The tragedy is that the worst is yet to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Martin report has demonstrated a need for more rigorous supervisory regimes in this riskier lending environment. The Reserve Bank, as supervisor, needs to be more vigilant and have the appropriate tools to undertake the task. The Reserve Bank has clearly not been as alert as it should have been in relation to how deregulation had changed its role as supervisor of the banking industry. While more vigilance may somewhat reduce the number of bankruptcies, only a change to the economic environment&mdash;which will be initiated by a Liberal-National Party government&mdash;will have a sufficiently beneficial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little more than a year ago&mdash;at the outset of the Martin inquiry into banking&mdash;those involved in the uppermost levels of the banking industry must have felt that they were in for a lot more than a mere public flogging or even a diligent media going-over. The public perception of banks and banking then was unconditionally at an all-time low. Doubtless one of the growing numbers of ex-Treasurers, Mr Keating, saw it as very convenient timing to launch into an attack on banks when public antipathy for the industry was at its zenith. At least temporarily, the inquiry proved to be a sound diversionary tactic for the Labor Government and its former Treasurer to turn up the heat on the peril the industry was facing and away from the Keating-engineered recession that the country was uncontrollably sliding towards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for the financial and banking sectors, public confidence has not improved a great deal since that time. With the collapse and demise of a number of Australian financial institutions&mdash;the South Australian State Bank, the State Bank of Victoria and the Pyramid Building Society, to name just a few&mdash;Labor governments, State and Federal, around Australia have completely lost the confidence of the people, while the banks still have to regain the confidence and trust of their customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only the eviction of Labor from wherever it holds office can restore overall confidence. Let us hope that this transition occurs quickly because the changes which are still to take place should result in significant benefits to all Australians and to our economy. It is evident that a more responsive and innovative banking sector is emerging in the wake of financial deregulation. We also hope that many lessons have been learned from the banking industry's past mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been huge banking failures in this country in recent times. In my own State of South Australia the most recent State Bank catastrophe was in some respects similar to what happened the previous time South Australia lost a bank. The Bank of Adelaide was crippled 17 years ago in 1974 by its subsidiary Finance Corporation of Australia and had to be bought by the ANZ Bank. The big difference was that the limited number of voluntary shareholders in the Bank of Adelaide suffered in the former situation, whereas in the case of the State Bank all South Australians are compulsorily suffering because of the Bannon Labor Government's bale-out of the bank's enormous debt at taxpayers' expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year in February the then newly appointed Chief Executive of the State Bank of South Australia, Stephen Patterson, claimed that there was no comparison between the State Bank disasters of Victoria and South Australia. He was right in one respect: the legacy that South Australian Labor Premier John Bannon has left South Australians is much worse than the legacy left to Victorians and Premier Joan Kirner by her Labor predecessor, John Cain. About the same proportion of their banks' loan books were not paying interest&mdash;17.1 per cent in South Australia and 19 per cent in Victoria&mdash;but the big difference between them was the location of the incompetence, and failure in South Australia to accept and distribute responsibility properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common thread in Victoria and South Australia is that they arrived at exactly the same place, though it was by separate paths. Each State has had to sell assets to help raise $1 billion to pay for bad loans. Maybe Premier Bannon was exceptionally lucky in that he had some other assets to sell off. Premier Kirner was left an empty cupboard; she had to sell the bank itself. But, worse than that, Premier Bannon, through political expediency, indulged in the worst form of child abuse. He borrowed massively, thereby mortgaging to the hilt the future for South Australia's children to fund the bank's shortfall rather than having the guts to cop the fully deserved political fallout out of raising State taxes now to fund the debt. What unmitigated cowardice to make the next generation suffer for his folly and for the folly of this generation in ever entrusting him with the reins of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent of the Bill before us is essentially to facilitate the amalgamation of a savings bank subsidiary into its trading bank parent within those banking groups affected by the Government's decision to remove the distinction between trading and savings banks for regulatory purposes. It removes some significant impediments arising from the administration costs and legal difficulties associated with the integration of savings and trading banks within the same group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As there will be no imposition of taxes and fees under State law and there will be neutrality under income tax law, the Bill has no financial impact and consequently the Liberal and National parties lend their support to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of bank regulation in this country has seen a strong distinction between trading banks and savings banks despite the fact that for much of the time even banks themselves saw that there was much to be gained from their amalgamation. But these very regulatory requirements placed unnecessary obstacles in the path of achieving the full economic benefits and efficiencies of a single bank focus. In 1989 the earlier Banking Legislation Amendment Act, as I have already mentioned, removed these regulatory distinctions between trading and savings banks, but left the legal entities still intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are advised that this Bill is the result of extensive consultation with members of the Australian Bankers Association and it has the support of the banking industry. To that extent, in schedule 1 of the Bill's table of provisions, there are eight trading banks or receiving banks involved. These comprise the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, the Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of Queensland Ltd, Citibank Ltd, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the National Australia Bank Ltd, the National Mutual Royal Bank Ltd and Westpac Banking Corporation. The transferring banks&mdash;that is, those which will be transferred across to the trading banks&mdash;will be the Australia and New Zealand Savings Bank Ltd, the Bank of New Zealand Savings Bank Ltd, the Bank of Queensland Savings Bank Ltd, Citibank Savings Ltd, the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, the National Australia Savings Bank Ltd, the National Mutual Royal Savings Bank Ltd and Westpac Savings Bank Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting here that much of the credit for the evolution and initial development of banks&mdash;and, indeed, of the largest bank in Australia, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia&mdash;was provided not by a Labor Government, as is commonly believed, but in 1924 by an Act introduced by the Bruce-Page Nationalist-Country Party Government. Many of the progressive plans for the Bank's future were put in place by that Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite being the largest bank in Australia, the Commonwealth Bank, along with the National Australia and Westpac banks, has demonstrated a history of difficulties with bad debts. This is evident in, for example, the National Australia Bank Managing Director's review of 1989-90 which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were obliged to double the charge against profit for bad and doubtful debts while the cost of funding non-accrual loans became an increasing burden.</PARA>
<PARA>The Managing Director of Westpac and the annual report of the Commonwealth Bank make similar comments about bad debts. This was the case not only with the larger banks but also with, for example, the State owned Rural Industries Bank of Western Australia, the State Bank of New South Wales and the Tasmania Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, none of this is news to the Opposition. These are precisely the sorts of problems we have been bringing to the fore for some time, but this hard of hearing Government chooses not to listen. It is no secret that the banking industry has undergone massive changes during the years of deregulation, but to blame deregulation for causing all bankers or customers ill is irresponsible in the extreme. However, during deregulation, banks and other financial organisations did not apply the correct risk control or accountability for many of their lending policies during the 1980s and that factor itself developed into a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this poor risk control and poor loans policy by a number of our major banks, and together with their lack of accountability in that area, many bank customers overborrowed, became too highly geared and in a great majority of cases borrowed against assets already overvalued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Government was good enough to table today a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Summary Interim Report </EMPHASIS>of the Australian Securities Commission into the administration of Burns Philp Trustee Co. Ltd as trustee of the Estate Mortgage Trusts. This matter is of particular importance because tomorrow in Sydney there is a meeting of unit holders of the six trusts administered by Burns Philp Trustee Co. as trustee for Estate Mortgage. There are some 52,000 Australians&mdash;mainly small investors&mdash;who put money into these trusts and who for almost the last 18 months have received nothing in return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is significant in so much as I believe it is the first report by the Australian Securities Commission into mortgage trusts which are administered by trustee companies. At a time when Australians are increasingly being encouraged to provide for their own retirement it is significant that this Parliament and the Government ensure that there are correct and adequate procedures in place to oversee the management of these trusts. The report which has been tabled before the Senate clearly indicates the failure of the then existing regulatory regime. It also shows the clear failure of the National Companies and Securities Commission to properly oversee the trusts and the operations of the trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into incredible length in discussing this matter, but I think it is appropriate to have a chronology of the relevant events, because in late 1989 there were a series of runs on Estate Mortgage and a number of adverse comments were made on the trusts by investment advisers. In early 1990 dividend distributions to unit holders were some two to three weeks late. Continued pressure on the liquidity of the trusts prompted the National Companies and Securities Commission on 16 February 1990 to require the trusts to produce cash flow reports every two days. At all times after 16 February 1990 redemptions exceeded new subscriptions to the trusts by at least $750,000 per day, with liquidity only being maintained by the borrowings and assignments of interests in mortgages held by the trusts. It is interesting to note that on some days it is believed that redemptions exceeded new subscriptions by as much as $7m&mdash;in the space of one day!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 March 1990 supplemental trust deeds were executed, allowing the trustee to grant priority interests in assigned mortgages to third parties ahead of the trusts. These supplemental trust deeds required approval by the NCSC. The NCSC approved the supplemental trust deeds on 22 March 1990. Shortly thereafter a number of deeds of priority were executed in favour of certain banks and other financial institutions. On 30 March 1990 the trustee advised the NCSC that the trusts had failed to meet redemptions as required and further redemptions on units in the trust were frozen with the NCSC on 11 April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is stated in the report by the Australian Securities Commission that it formed the view that there is evidence to suggest that Burns Philp Trustee Co. breached the terms of the trusts in the way it operated. The Commission formed this view because it believed there was evidence that breaches of trust had occurred when the trustee permitted the intermingling of unit holders' money between trusts. There were six different trusts and the moneys and the assets of at least five of these were all pooled, contrary to the terms of the trust. As a result, it has been almost impossible for the new trustees to ascertain which assets belong to which trust. The report has also found, and this is most significant:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breaches of trust occurred when the Trustee authorised the execution of supplementary deeds providing for the assignment of mortgages and permitting the Trustee to fix the priority of the trusts ahead of, or behind, the assignee without considering, as set out in the trust deeds, whether unitholders may be adversely affected by such amendments.</PARA>
<PARA>The significance of that finding is very important. It means that when the trust was assigning interests in mortgages before 21 March, at best, the assignees ranked equal with the trusts. By giving them priority over the trusts, the trustee effectively diluted the net asset backing of the trusts and left the unit holders with nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very clear as at 21 March that the value of the properties that constituted the trust portfolio had dropped dramatically. By giving a first ranking mortgage to a bank or another financial institution, the trustee effectively deprived the unit holders of the benefit of the value of those mortgages. For 52,000 Australians, as I am sure Senator Collins would agree, that is a very significant and very tragic finding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Commission goes on to say that the trustee failed to require any procedures to regulate investments, despite the advice of lawyers to the contrary, and that breaches of trust occurred when the trustee purported to approve purchases of interests in mortgages when no documentation was executed to give effect to such purchases. The report is saying that the trustee purchased mortgages or mortgage interests in properties and never got adequate documentation. So potentially, the purchases could never be proved. That is frightening. We are talking about millions of dollars. The report also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breaches of trust have occurred in relation to transactions in which companies associated with the Manager were involved and in which the Manager had a potential conflict of interest and the Trustee took no proper steps to obtain advice independent of the Manager.</PARA>
<PARA>That is particularly disturbing. The reasons why the ASC comes to that conclusion are contained in the body of the report, and I do not wish to canvass the matter further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission also finds that there is evidence that the trustee may have failed to exercise due diligence and vigilance in carrying out its functions. It sets out the reasons for that. That is very disturbing. People were putting their money into these trusts in the belief that they were investing in a safe investment; in fact, they found that was not the case. They found that the trusts were not even complying with the terms of the trust deed and, moreover, that the trust deeds were amended shortly before the trusts fell over, with a detrimental effect on unit holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another very important matter which is raised in the report. The supplemental trust deeds required the approval of the National Companies and Securities Commission. I believe that the NCSC acted negligently in allowing these trust deeds to be executed. It was under a duty to properly consider the interests of the trusts and unit holders when it approved the supplemental trust deeds on 22 March 1991. By approving these deeds, the NCSC facilitated the dilution of the net asset backing of the trusts when interests in mortgages were subsequently granted in priority to those of the trust. Although the supplemental trust deeds themselves did not result in a dilution of the net asset backing of the trusts, the consequent deeds of priority surely did. This surely should have been within the reckoning of the NCSC at the time it approved those deeds. There would have been no other purpose in creating those supplemental trust deeds other than to allow the trust to give priority to somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way the NCSC could merely rely upon some assurance that the manager and the trustee were addressing the problem of declining liquidity in the trusts. The NCSC knew that from 16 February onwards there was a continuing drain on liquidity of the trusts. If it was sufficient for the NCSC to rely upon that assurance, there would have been little purpose in requiring the trust to make cash flow reports every two days. If it is to be said that the NCSC operated properly, it is necessary for the NCSC, or its successor, to show what steps it took to verify the assurances which were received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the report makes recommendations as to deficiencies in the law which it believes need to be rectified. It says, in particular, that security properties being valued should not be valued on an on-completion basis, that the same valuers should not be used time and again to value properties in the same trust, and that failure by trustees to ensure that accounts in mortgage trusts disclose all matters which are likely to materially affect the prospects of the trusts should not be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition will look very closely at these matters, as I am sure the Government will, because it is fundamental that we get these legislative provisions right. It was a very sad event that occurred. Everybody hopes that it does not occur again. This will only be done by properly looking into the activities in question. I look forward to hearing the deliberations of the Senate and the House of Representatives at a later date, as do all unit holders of these trusts, to ensure that this catastrophe never occurs again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has been very keen to talk about social justice. It has become patently obvious that the political strategists have decided that social justice by default will be a major political theme for the Government in the run-up to the next election. How on earth the Government can decide on that when the level of unemployment is currently running at 10 per cent I do not know. But we should never be so naive that we take the Government's rhetoric at face value. After all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. We should always ask whether the Government is backing up its self-congratulatory rhetoric with substantive programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One classic case that I have found which is all talk but very little positive action is the provision of Skillshare places for people with moderate disabilities. Under the now defunct community training program, the Government funded a limited number of specialist projects which provided training for people with disabilities. These projects were integrated into the newly formed Skillshare. In the 1991 Skillshare guidelines, special consideration was given to group focused projects which concentrated on the particular needs of people with disabilities. These projects received additional funding and special dispensation in terms of their contracted client numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these group focused projects have been chopped from the 1992 Skillshare guidelines. The Government claims it has adopted a policy of integrating people with disabilities into all Skillshare projects and that it has set up disability access and support units to facilitate this integration. If it is anything like its integration of people into open employment, then I think it is already doomed. I have already pointed out to the chamber the figures and the appalling record that the Australian Public Service has in employing people with disabilities. Given that the Government is pushing towards closing down sheltered workshops and encouraging people with disabilities into open employment&mdash;a goal that we in the Opposition support; we did not support the way it was done&mdash;we would have expected the Australian Public Service to increase the number of people with disabilities, but that is not so. So where are these people supposed to go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government's record on integration is anything like the record it has already exhibited on integration of people with disabilities into the Australian Public Service, then I do not believe that what it is attempting to do here will be achieved, especially given some of the other facts I will put before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government says that general outreach funding will be made available to offset the extra costs borne by individual Skillshare projects throughout this integration process. This sounds all very well and good, but it is important to look at the current participation rate of people with disabilities in Skillshare and the advice the Government has received from its own disability strategy consultancy. The participation rate of people with disabilities in Skillshare remains static at about 6 per cent, despite Minister Bolkus's claim last May that the rate was nearly 9 per cent. That is what he told us, but it is not what the figures show. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest statistics also reveal that 13.6 per cent of unemployed people awaiting placement have a disability, which is a 1.4 per cent increase on the figure that was cited by Minister Bolkus in May this year. Two points need to be made. First, people with disabilities are obviously very significantly underrepresented in Skillshare training programs; secondly, the degree of underrepresentation has not decreased and, in fact, appears to be increasing. This is a serious shortfall which obviously requires a substantive policy response from the Government. From the evidence to date, one doubts whether the Government's response has the substance that is required in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consultancy comprising Dr John Lewis from the Phillip Institute of Technology and Ms Sandy Cook from the University of Melbourne was contracted to prepare a paper for the DEET Skillshare strategy. The draft of this paper was completed in July this year and distributed to all Skillshare projects. The paper made two very important recommendations. First, in recognition of significant assistance given to an increased number of clients with disabilities, individual Skillshare projects would be able to negotiate with area directors for a reduction in their contracted requirements in relation to the number of clients they would assist. The second important recommendation was that extra financial support, in the form of community outreach modular funding to individual projects, would be offered as a means of meeting any special needs of people with disabilities. Continued allocation of this modular funding would be dependent on projects meeting set target rates of participation by people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the consultancy recommended that all generic Skillshare projects integrate people with disabilities, it recognised that there are additional costs inherent in catering for the special needs entailed in this integration process. Given that this draft strategy paper was distributed to all Skillshare projects, and given that the relevant section of the 1992 Skillshare guidelines, which are headed `Skillshare Disability Strategy', commences by saying, `A strategy for enhanced service delivery to people with disabilities has been developed for the Skillshare Program to ensure that this target group has equitable access to the Program', surely individual Skillshare projects could have felt confident that the recommendations from the strategy paper would be incorporated in the 1992 guidelines. However, this has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the capacity for projects to provide services focused on people with disabilities has been removed from the guidelines, but there is no recognition in the guidelines of the fact that individual Skillshare projects may not be able to maintain a normal level of clients if they are to meet the targets that are set down in the strategy paper. This omission amounts to a major disincentive for Skillshare projects contemplating taking on larger numbers of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Skillshare strategy paper acknowledges the special training needs of people with disabilities. In many instances, meeting these special needs requires input of a larger number of manpower hours than would be the case for people without disabilities. Often, meeting the special needs of people with disabilities may also require the input of specialist trainers. Government funding of Skillshare projects is directly linked to client numbers. The Government's failure to take account of the special needs of people with disabilities by allowing a reduction in contracted client numbers, as I said before, will act as a significant disincentive to Skillshare projects taking on clients with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a major discrepancy between the draft strategy paper and the 1992 Skillshare guidelines in terms of the nature of community outreach funding that will be provided to Skillshare projects which actually do take on people with disabilities. The strategy paper sets out designated target rates of participation by people with disabilities as an incentive for the receipt of additional modular funding. These target rates are 8 per cent in 1992, 10 per cent in 1993 and 13 per cent in 1994. However, the Skillshare guidelines merely state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outreach funds may be used to enable generic SkillShare Sponsors to increase and improve services for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>These outreach funds are not restricted to projects which target people with disabilities. Outreach money for projects targeting people with disabilities will be taken from a pool of outreach funding which caters for rural and regional projects, as well as projects that cater for a range of other disadvantaged Skillshare target groups, such as disadvantaged youth. I am not saying that those groups should not be covered. What I am saying is that now those people with disabilities will have to compete with those groups for that outreach funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is really serious about achieving an across-the-board 13.6 per cent participation rate by people with disabilities in Skillshare, as Senator Bolkus claimed last week, then there must be real doubt as to whether there will be sufficient outreach funding to facilitate this increase&mdash;and it is a very significant increase&mdash;from the numbers who are now currently participating in Skillshare programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the fact that Skillshare and virtually every other DEET training program continues to be an abject failure in terms of recruiting numbers of people with disabilities that are comparable with their representation in the unemployed population, I am also very concerned that the designated target rates set out in the strategy paper have been omitted from the Skillshare guidelines. The 1992 guidelines merely state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actual percentage will be negotiated with Area Directors and will depend on the numbers of the particular category of the target groups in the local area and the degree of difficulty that may be experienced in encouraging participation.</PARA>
<PARA>During Question Time on 4 December I expressed these concerns to Minister Bolkus, who represents Mr Baldwin in the Senate. In his answer, the Minister stated that, to the extent that he had not answered my question, he would get further information for me. That is what he actually said. To assist Senator Bolkus, as I believed that he had not adequately answered my question, I wrote a letter to him the next day and expressed my concerns about the issues which I believed had not been addressed in the answer. I think he admitted in his answer to me, when he talked about any outstanding issues, that he believed that he had not adequately answered my question either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I extended to him the courtesy of writing a letter and asking him to explain the discrepancy between the Skillshare guidelines and the strategy paper, and requesting confirmation that sufficient outreach money would be available to fund all Skillshare projects. No answer was forthcoming from the Minister, despite the fact that his office gave my office an undertaking that I would have an answer after Question Time on Monday. On Monday we had a delayed Question Time. I sat around waiting for Senator Bolkus's answer and, much to my surprise, he walked out of the chamber. I sat with eager anticipation on Tuesday, thinking that I would get an answer from Senator Bolkus. Again, he waltzed out of the chamber and I waited in vain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to wait in vain any longer and I believe I should bring this to the chamber. I asked the Minister a question, the question was not adequately answered, the Minister told me that he would get me further information and I have not got it. I consider that it is not adequate or appropriate for the Minister to behave in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Senator Bolkus's office informed my office that no answer would be provided until the Minister met with the peak organisation&mdash;namely ACROD&mdash;in a week's time. We most probably will not be here then. I consider the behaviour of Mr Baldwin and Senator Bolkus, representing Mr Baldwin, to be a disgraceful</PARA>
<PARA>disregard of this House. I asked the Minister a question in relation to a program which is funded from the 1991-92 Budget and about which 1992 guidelines have been drawn up and given to program providers. My question was a simple one: there was a discrepancy and I wanted to know why. My question was one which had the potential to impact on a significant number of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am fully aware that ACROD has expressed its concerns to the Minister in relation to this matter. But the Minister simply refused to answer my question until he was able to sort it out in some way. It should be as plain as the nose on his face. He should be able to say why there is a difference and, if there is a difference, whether it was an error or whether it was intentional and the Government does not intend to fund that integration which it boasts about. I believe the Minister's behaviour amounts to nothing less than a dismissing of the role of the Senate as a representative of the people and, particularly in this instance, as a representative of those people with disabilities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable  senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was briefed by his Department on a request from the AWB for approval to acquire shares in the Moora Pulp and Paper Co. Pty. Ltd. (the Company). The Secretary of the Department, who at the time was the Government Member on the Board of the AWB, was provided with a copy of that briefing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The AWB wrote to the Minister on 6 June 1991 seeking his approval for this investment. On the basis of advice from Attorney-General's Department, the AWB was informed by the Minister that it did not require Ministerial approval to invest money of the Wheat Industry Fund (WIF) in this project, provided the AWB was assured that the purpose of the acquisition of the shares was for the sake of the income to be generated by the investment and not for some other purpose. Ministerial approval had previously been given under Section 82(1)(e) of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 for the AWB to invest WIF money in any manner consistent with sound commercial practice. In their request for approval the AWB did not advise the Minister of the existence of any consultant's reports into the project, either by Jaakko Poyry or any other consultant group. The Minister was advised by the AWB that the Grains Council of Australia had approved the project and the use of WIF moneys to finance the acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3), (4), (5) and (6) Subsequent to the AWB going ahead with its proposal, the Minister became aware that Jaakko Poyry had provided to the AWB a confidential report on the project which was also made available to the Moora Board. The report remains confidential and for this reason was not provided to the Minister and is therefore not available to the Parliament. The assessment of the findings of that report was a matter of commercial judgement for the AWB. The results of other studies on the Moora project which were commissioned by outside organisations, such as the Printing and Kindred Industries Union, remain confidential to those persons unless they have agreed to release them. Even in that case, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to comment, since such findings need to be evaluated against other commercial information in respect of the project which would not normally be readily available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 and the associated Wheat Industry Fund Regulations set out in broad terms the purposes for which WIF monies may be used. The legislation also requires the AWB to manage the WIF in accordance with an Annual Business Plan approved by the Grains Council of Australia. The Minister is not involved in the development or approval of these Plans and this arrangement recognises that the WIF is an industry fund made up from a levy on wheat growers. The Government's main involvement with the WIF is the provision of a five year $100m guarantee for WIF related borrowings, which in the first instance are backed by the WIF and its associated assets. Given that the interim report of the WIF for the 12 months to 30 June 1991 indicated a value of over $70m, the first stage of the Moora investment, at only $1.2m, is a small fraction of the equity in the WIF. In this case there are no grounds for the Minister to intervene.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Tenders for the supply of bayonets and bayonet/combat knives were not called. The Army requirement for a bayonet/combat knife was circulated to all known interested Australian arms dealers representing Australian and overseas companies, and samples requested for evaluation.
