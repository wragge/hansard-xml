<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee from time to time asks Ministers to nominate officials from the relevant department to attend meetings to assist its deliberations. In this case the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, not only sent along one of the most senior officials in this particular area, but also one of his own staff members. This was the first time this had been done for many years, if at all. The Committee is grateful to Senator Tate for this level of cooperation. As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a statement of the work of the Committee during the present sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATEMENT OF WORK OF COMMITTEE DURING BUDGET SITTINGS 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Committee during the present sittings involved the scrutiny of the usual large number of instruments of delegated legislation tabled in the Senate and subject to disallowance. Such delegated legislation was made under the authority of scores of parent Acts administered through every Department of State. It was made by the Governor-General, by Ministers, by officials, by statutory authorities and by courts and tribunals. Virtually every legislative scheme relies on delegated legislation to fill in administrative details of its operation, without which public administration would not be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate itself to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure that they conform to the high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties which the Parliament applies to Acts. Where the Committee detects what appears to be a defect in delegated legislation it writes to the Minister asking that the instrument be amended or other action taken. In cases of a serious breach of propriety or liberties, the Committee reports to the Senate and places a protective notice of disallowance upon the instrument, in case the Committee should wish to recommend such action. However, this final sanction is rarely invoked. Almost invariably the Minister agrees to take action, often including amendment, to meet the concerns of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During these sittings Ministers and other law makers have undertaken to amend 23 instruments or parent Acts to satisfy the Committee. This does not include undertakings to take administrative action or to provide numbering and citation for instruments. This illustrates the high level of cooperation which the Committee receives from Ministers in its non-partisan operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the sittings the Committee scrutinised 778 instruments, which is historically a high number. Of these, only 263 were from the Statutory Rules series, which are generally of a higher quality than other series. The rest of the instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of ordinances, declarations, determinations, directions, rules, orders, plans, deeds, guidelines, notices, exemptions, licences, standards, codes of conduct, specifications and approvals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each one of these instruments was scrutinised by the Committee under its four Principles, or terms of reference, which are provided for in the Standing Orders. The Committee detected prima facie defects in 94 out of the 778 instruments which it scrutinised. These defects are described below under each of the four Principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Principle covers every aspect of parliamentary propriety. It is not merely a narrow legal check of technical validity. Nevertheless, the first requirement under this Principle is that delegated legislation should not have any technical or other defects apparent on its face. In this context an instrument will be defective if its drafting, presentation and access is less than that of an Act. In one instrument a commencement provision was left blank. In another a provision referred to an activity prohibited by paragraph (a) but there was no such paragraph. Another contained two provisions with the same number. One set of regulations contained 10 separate cross-reference errors. Two more instruments provided for review of non-existing provisions. One instrument was ineffective because it was tabled without a Schedule. Another had wrong attachments, another missing attachments. One regulation included blocks of ages numbered "25 to 30", "30 to 35", "35 to 40" and so on. One instrument mentioned two Australian towns, each with five separate entries in the Australia Post Postcode, without indicating to which State the provision referred. One substituted copy of an instrument corrected an error in the first copy, but itself made another error. A number of instruments included spelling errors, including one in an international treaty. Another misspelt the name of a large Australian regional city. One instrument gave the wrong date for a consolidation. On the other hand, another instrument amended the principal instrument for the 344th time, but with a consolidation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a breach of parliamentary propriety if changes in taxes, levies, fees, charges or allowances are not explained. One instrument doubled an allowance paid to public servants, another doubled a particular fee. Another substituted an allowance with an identical sum. The same instrument increased one allowance for public servants from $382.78 to $382.79 and another from $382.79 to $382.80. Here the Committee was concerned that the public servants might be left without a penny to spend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Delegated legislation must effect an intention evident on its face or advised in the Explanatory Statement. One instrument prescribed a levy of 0.25 cents per unit. However, the Explanatory Statement twice advised that the purpose of the instrument was to prescribe 0.0025 cents and that the maximum permissible amount of levy under the parent Act was 0.0025 cents. Another Explanatory Statement advised that the purpose of the instrument was to allocate States Grants money to one State and one Territory, whereas the instrument allocated money to three States and two Territories. Another advised that the intention of the instrument was to allocate a stated sum of States Grants money, but the instrument allocated a different sum. Another Explanatory Statement advised that the instrument was intended to provide only for officers of the Department to be authorised officers, although the instrument itself provided for any person at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Delegated legislation often provides for public officials to delegate powers granted to them by that delegated legislation. Such delegation must be appropriate in all the circumstances. In one instrument, important powers could be exercised as delegates by certain senior officers, who were carefully and properly limited by rank. However, the power to appoint such officers could be delegated to any person at all.  In another case a statutory authority could determine conditions to which certain standards were subject. This was virtually the same as determining the standards themselves. In another instrument one class of persons, for whom no qualifications or experience were prescribed, could appoint another class of persons for whom there were such requirements. In addition, the first class of persons could delegate most of their powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general scheme of delegated legislation may be so unusual on its face that the Committee will write to the Minister. In one instrument the Explanatory Statement advised that the instrument repealed regulations dealing with an international organisation of which Australia had ceased to be a member in 1980. Conversely, another instrument effected arrangements under an international treaty signed four years before. In another case, two separate but related series of delegated legislation had not been synchronised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS> provides that delegated legislation which operates to the prejudice of any person other than the Commonwealth is of no effect. Many instruments of delegated legislation do operate retrospectively and in every case the Committee requires an assurance that no member of the public is adversely affected. In one case the Minister was unable to give such an assurance but advised that the parent Act expressly provided for such prejudice. The Committee then asked for a special Report from its Legal Adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, who concluded that, on balance, the Act could be said to have this effect. In another case there was apparent prejudicial retrospectivity affecting livelihood. In another there was possible prejudice because an instrument was expressed to commence on the date of another which may have commenced earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every instrument of delegated legislation should be accompanied by an Explanatory Statement giving the background to the instrument and explaining its provisions. One instrument did not have an Explanatory Statement, although it dealt with the recovery of public money. Another Explanatory Statement did not advise that one of the purposes of the instrument was to implement undertakings given by the Minister to the Committee. Another Explanatory Statement gave incorrect references to provisions in the parent Act. Other Explanatory Statements were similarly brief, incomplete or inaccurate. In a related area, some instruments had no numbering or citation, without which delegated legislation may be confusing and imprecise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee questioned other instruments which may have breached parliamentary propriety. One of these was so uncertain and subjective in its effect that it may have been defective. Another provided for notices which may have been legislative or partly legislative in effect and yet were not subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (b)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee interprets this principle in a broad and expanding fashion to ensure that delegated legislation does not operate adversely on any aspect of personal rights or liberties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time delegated legislation fills in details of the administration of elections. Such details must provide full safeguards both for those standing for election and for those voting. One instrument provided that any voter may request a secret ballot. However, there was no requirement for voters to be informed of this right, although there was extensive provisions for them to be informed of other, seemingly less important, rights. Another provision required a voter to place the number "1" in a box to indicate his or her preference. Nevertheless, another provision merely required the voter to indicate an intention, which appeared to indicate that a tick or a cross, a "yes" or an "aye" might be a valid vote. Another provision required only that the winner of an election be notified. There was no requirement for the losing candidates or even for the general body of voters to be informed, even though other information, such as a list of candidates, had to be publicly notified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee looks closely at any offence provisions. Every sittings delegated legislation includes a number of strict liability offences, each one of which is questioned by the Committee. One such strict liability offence related to duties of employers. Another instrument replaced general offence provisions with specific penalties for each offence. This was an appropriate change, particularly as most offences, which had previously been strict liability, were now provided with a defence of reasonable excuse. Nevertheless, some provisions were still strict liability. Furthermore, there seemed to be no obvious reason why some of these provided for such liability, as they included offences for which a reasonable excuse would seem suitable. For instance, one strict liability offence did not take account of adverse weather conditions which would make it impossible to comply with the provision. Another instrument provided for vicarious liability, with adverse mandatory consequences affecting a person's livelihood flowing from such liability. This vicarious liability was imposed on the owner of a boat used previously to commit an offence, even if the offence had been committed when the boat had a previous owner. One instrument dealing with drug trafficking and the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking seemed to provide for strict enforcement measures, although these may have been justifiable given the nature of the subject matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discriminatory legislation is a breach of personal rights and the Committee insists on a full explanation of such provisions. One instrument provided that the working age for males is up to 65 years while for females it is up to 60 years. Another expressly provided for factors such as nationality, sex, age and marital status to be taken into account when making decisions. Another included provisions which may have disadvantaged Australian companies in favour of foreign companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Delegated legislation must not unreasonably affect a person's livelihood. The Committee not only ensures that decisions by public officials affecting livelihood are subject to appropriate review, but also that mandatory provisions do not operate adversely. One instrument appeared to provide that if a cheque from an applicant for an extension of a commercial privilege was dishonoured, then that privilege would automatically terminate. Another provided for methods of labelling which raised concerns about unnecessary costs imposed upon smaller producers. Numbers of recent instruments have provided for the facsimile transmission of mandatory information to public officials in place of existing manual methods. This is an appropriate change which should assist users. However, such changes should not prejudice smaller businesses who may wish to continue to use existing methods. The Committee questioned one instrument which provided for transmission of a form by post but for amendments of the form by facsimile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to privacy is an important aspect of personal liberties. Delegated legislation must not intrude on this right. The Committee suggested that exemptions from the provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privacy Act 1988</EMPHASIS> should be expressed more clearly. Again, the Committee questioned another instrument which omitted two of the 11 Information Privacy Principles provided by that Act. Conversely, the Committee raised a provision which seemed to exclude the public from important provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Freedom of Information Act 1982</EMPHASIS> for a period of five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was concerned at a number of other provisions. One doubled a fee with no explanation. Another operated with prejudicial retrospectivity. Both of these breached personal rights as well as parliamentary propriety. Another instrument appeared to provide for a person to elect under its provisions before the provisions came into effect. On a lighter note, one instrument provided for "sentencing". The Committee was immediately alert to the need for appropriate safeguards. However, the Explanatory Statement explained that sentencing in this case was the archival process of classifying records according to the period for which each record is to be kept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (c)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many instruments of delegated legislation grant discretions to Ministers or public officials. Such discretions should be drafted as narrowly as possible, include objective criteria to limit and guide the exercise of the power, and in appropriate cases provide a right of review of the merits of the decision to an independent, external tribunal, which usually would be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the sittings one instrument gave a discretion to a public official to withdraw an infringement notice, with no apparent right of review. The Committee raised this with the Minister even though there were criteria provided to guide and limit the exercise of the power. The same instrument also provided a discretion to extend the time available for payment of a fine, again with no obvious right of review. Another discretion with no apparent review was to cancel certain numbers allocated to private individuals, with consequential adverse commercial implications. In another class of case the Committee questioned discretions granted to an electoral official to admit or reject votes and to declare an election void. In another case the Committee asked for an assurance that there was AAT review of conditions attached to a decision, as well as to the decision itself. In one case the Committee was dissatisfied with an instrument which, while it provided for AAT review, did not provide for the applicant to state a case before the decision was made. The Committee also followed the progress of the review provisions of principal regulations and associated specialist review regulations which had been first made and then amended some 41 times in the 24 months to the end of the present sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (d)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation contain matters more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Principle is not often raised by the Committee. Nevertheless, it is an important element of parliamentary propriety. The only instrument which may have been defective under this Principle provided for decisions to be made by officials on the grounds of nationality, sex, age and marital status. As well as being a possible breach of personal liberties, the Committee considered that such unusual provisions could be more suited for inclusion in an Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future Issues</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important future development in Commonwealth delegated legislation is the Administrative Review Council Report on Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies, which is expected to be presented to the Minister this month. The Committee has already reported to the Senate on the Terms of Reference of the inquiry, on the Committee's submission to the inquiry and on the Interim Report by the ARC. It was very pleasing that the ARC accepted all of the main points put to it by the Committee. If the final Report is along the same lines and is implemented then Commonwealth delegated legislation will be made within a single series, include all legislation properly so called, be properly drafted and presented, and have appropriate access. The Chair of the Committee has reported to the Senate several times that the implementation of these points would represent the greatest reform of delegated legislation since the passage of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS>. Earlier this month members of the Committee had the opportunity of discussing these issues with members of the ARC at a dinner held here in Parliament House. These gatherings, which have become regular affairs held every two years, are an opportunity for the legislative scrutiny Committees to meet informally with the ARC, the peak Commonwealth body concerned with review of administrative decisions. The Committee will, of course, report in detail to the Senate when the final Report is available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the sittings there was another significant development in the operations of the Committee. From time to time the Committee asks Ministers whether senior officials of the Department could attend meetings to assist in its deliberation on particular instruments. This was done recently in respect of a sensitive instrument; the Committee asking the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator the Hon Michael Tate, to nominate a senior official to attend a meeting. The Minister not only sent a Senior Executive Service officer from the Department, but also a member of his personal staff. It is not known whether this has ever been done before, but certainly it is an innovation for present members of the Committee. This is a good example of the willingness of Ministers to cooperate with the Committee to ensure that delegated legislation is of the highest quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Committee was pleased to note a generous description of its work. Opening a public seminar on delegated legislation the Acting Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Norman Reaburn, observed that the operations of the Committee were "vital to maintaining the integrity of the law of this country". That was a gratifying comment from such a senior official.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr President, no mention has been made of the fact that the Opposition members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure have presented a dissenting report, which was supposed to have been attached to the Committee's report. The Opposition members of the Committee successfully moved a motion, after listening to six hours of contributions from representatives of transport industries right around Australia. The resulting resolution adopted by the Committee reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Committee recommends that the Senate not proceed with the National Road Transport Commission Bill, because of the failure of the Government to adequately answer questions raised in evidence before the Committee as to the impact of the legislation, unless and until the Interim National Road Transport Commission examines and publicly reports on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.the economic and social impact of full cost recovery of road costs on rural and regional Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.all input taxes and charges paid by the road transport industry;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.the likely level of Road Charges and Road Use Charges on various operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Committee has had time to consider the Interim Commission's Report.</PARA>
<PARA>This morning we attended a meeting called by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, and we were given a copy of a draft report which was to be presented this morning. Of course, this morning the numbers at the Committee were different and our recommendation was overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I do not object to the Government members on the Committee using the numbers if they have them. But what I do object to very strongly&mdash;and I said so at the Committee this morning&mdash;is that this was done after we had listened to six hours of informed submissions from representatives of the transport industry coming from all round Australia. We had submissions from L. Arthur Pty Ltd; BHP Transport; the Hon. F. Finch, Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works; the National Freight Forwarders Association; and the Victorian Road Transport Association Inc. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appearances were made not only by members of the Department&mdash;and the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) was in attendance&mdash;but also by Mr G. Boulton, National Freight Forwarders Association; the Hon. F. Finch, Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works; Mr B. Fletcher, Fletchers Freighters; Mr G. Goucher, National Farmers Federation, representing all branches of the NFF; Mr R. Gunning and Mr B. McIver, Road Transport Forum; Mr J. McLean, New South Wales Branch of the Transport Workers Union of Australia; Mr J. Pearson, Long Distance Road Transport Association; and Mr R. Seach, of the transport firm of Goodman and Seach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Bill was referred to the Committee we had, at the most, only five days notice that our hearing was to take place. The people representing these transport groups, involving one of the most important industries in Australia and one that affects the costs paid by every Australian, turned up in Canberra within five days. Contrary to what normally occurs, we met on a Wednesday evening&mdash;commencing at 8 o'clock and going right through until 2.00 a.m. During that time not one of those witnesses moved from his place. That just demonstrates the importance of the National Road Transport Commission Bill, which has been dropped on the Senate without very much consultation with the industry at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we listened for six hours, Mr President. The problems and fears of imposing full cost recovery around Australia are enormous. There will be an enormous effect on those transport operators&mdash;and this is the point that sticks in my throat&mdash;without giving this proposed National Road Transport Commission any guidelines to look into what is being paid already. That is what I strongly object to. We will be setting up a commission for new commissioners&mdash;interim commissioners are there now&mdash;to define and set up a charge to reflect full cost recovery in Australia. They have no guidelines to look at what is already being paid and they have no guidelines to look into the efficiency of road-making in Australia; and from what I can see&mdash;especially on the eastern side of the continent&mdash;the road-making efficiency is terrible. As I say, they have been given nothing like that; yet here is a Bill that will set up a commission to do those things. We listened to those transport operators for six hours and there is not one mention in this report of what those people submitted or what their concerns are. </PARA>

I was very annoyed that the meeting was changed around, and I made it known in the Senate that it was changed around.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of very brief remarks on the report which has just been tabled in the Senate. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The main reason I did not attend the meeting that Senator Panizza mentioned when evidence was taken from various interest groups was that I had a conflicting appointment at that time. I think most honourable senators would be aware that back bench senators on the Government side serve on an overlapping number of Senate committees and joint committees. As a result, it is very difficult to get to every meeting of a Senate standing committee. I regret that I was unable to attend because it is an issue that I am interested in. It is an issue of interest in South Australia, the State I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am surprised that a motion was passed at the end of a meeting that I understood was to take evidence. Members of the Committee are quite entitled to put a motion. In view of the short time span available for consideration of the Bill, members of the Committee who were present at the meeting might have thought that was the most appropriate thing to do. I was unaware that a motion expressing a view about the Bill itself would be put at that meeting. I thought the meeting was to take evidence and that a subsequent meeting would be held to prepare the final report to be tabled in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I do not disagree with the right of Senator Panizza&mdash;or other honourable senators&mdash;to move any motion he liked at that meeting when public evidence had been taken. The Committee can choose to carry, defeat or amend the motion. At the meeting I was able to attend this morning I voted to support the Chairman's draft. I thought that, in view of the disagreement amongst members of the Committee, the only place this Bill will be resolved is here in the chamber. Senator Panizza has concerns about the Bill, Senator Macdonald is not here and, clearly, Senator Chapman will take part in the debate when it comes back into the full Senate. I do not think honourable senators should be concerned that the debate in the Committee is being ignored, because the debate on this important piece of legislation will take place in the full Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This incident demonstrates the problem of referring to the standing committees of the Senate lots of legislation which has to be investigated at short notice and reported on within a short time. Honourable senators serving on a number of committees cannot get to every committee hearing, come across all the evidence or brief themselves on all the hearings. Many honourable senators on both sides are serving on joint committees of the Parliament as well as Senate committees. There is a heavy workload. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a critic of the process of referring lots of legislation to standing committees, because I think the time and resources honourable senators can put into studying the Bills do not do justice to the committees. For example, I am on the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We are grappling with a major piece of legislation about amendments to the Trade Practices Act. It is a very technical inquiry, with conflicting evidence, dealing with a specific Bill. It has been a major effort of the Committee. Irrespective of political affiliation, as Committee members grapple with the information, their views are not along party lines. A major inquiry, into the cost of justice, conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has now been delayed for nearly a year because the Senate is referring to the Committee more and more legislation, which gets priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not watch out, the standing committees will lose a very valuable opportunity to conduct broad inquiries into matters of interest and concern in the community, because we are always being loaded down with work due to the referral of legislation. I do not think it would be a positive development if we were to lose, effectively, the ability to deal with major issues which have been referred by the Senate but which do not deal with legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note Senator Panizza's remarks. I think the debate should take place in the Senate. I apologise for not being at the meeting on Wednesday evening when the evidence was taken and the motion was put forward. I hope that the debate can proceed expeditiously in the Senate over the next two days, despite the differences of opinion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to support the remarks made by my colleagues Senator Panizza and Senator Reid. I address my comments through you, Mr Deputy President, to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan), to the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, and to the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Coulter).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case there has been a series of serious lapses in the way in which this matter has been handled. Let me refer to them, as I can see Senator McMullan blushing. The first point is that the Senate used to sit on Fridays. When sitting on Fridays it dealt with regular Senate business. However, we agreed&mdash;there was very sound agreement&mdash;that we forgo sitting as a Senate on Fridays to enable the standing committees of the Senate to meet to deal in particular with referred legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that for 20 years the standing committees of this Senate have been called Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees. One of the essential functions of the committees is to consider referred legislation:  to look at a Bill;  to hear reports from interested groups, such as those witnesses who came before this Committee whose names Senator Panizza has read out, and then to consider that evidence carefully; and to bring recommendations before the Senate so it can deal with the legislation. There is nothing at all wrong with the setting aside of Fridays or with the long established procedure of dealing with legislation in this way by Senate standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht made a criticism that the procedure is delaying some of the general purpose activities of these committees, and I reject that criticism. Clearly, what is required is for the general purpose sittings of committees to be conducted on days when the Senate is not sitting. I support the view that all sorts of important matters need to be properly considered by committees and brought to the Senate's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator McMullan and to Senator Foreman that the Government was at fault in intending to seek to get the National Road Transport Commission Bill approved in a rapid fashion in a series of days before the Senate rose for Christmas. This intention led to the date of the Senate Committee hearing being changed four times. When it was finally changed, with only 24 hours notice, to a Wednesday night&mdash;an unusual time&mdash;a Government senator, Senator Schacht, and an Australian Democrats senator, Senator Powell, were not present. In the case of the Democrats, Senator Powell did not even know that the meeting was occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that this type of mistake, this type of lapse, occurred as a result of going outside of our stable and well-ordered Senate committee procedures. Ultimately, I believe that the Government is at fault for forcing the pace and insisting that the Senate press everything into a constrained path in order to get some legislation passed before Christmas. In particular, where a matter is controversial, where there are different assessments and where the Opposition is opposed to a matter, we are in fact damaging the reputation of the Senate by using such a procedure. I make no criticism whatsoever of the Opposition senators on this Committee. I am directing my remarks to all of the lapses that have been rehearsed in the last half an hour to ensure that in future the Government does not force the pace when it leads to these sorts of errors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me assure those members of the public who are interested in the good procedure of the Parliament or who are concerned that the Senate go about its legislative duties properly that this is a sound Senate which has very well established procedures. This matter is very much the exception to the rule. It is a great pity that the Democrats did not have even 24 hours notice of the meeting, so did not have proper information. It is very important that senators representing the various parties be able to make arrangements to attend hearings. We will remember this as an example of the kind of conduct that is not up to the standards of the Senate. It ought not to be repeated just for the sake of the Government's trying to force legislation through this place in a way which is not acceptable to the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is returning to the debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991, the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. I was speaking when the matter was adjourned some weeks ago and I was restricting my remarks to the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill, which lifts the payment for fringe benefits from 47 per cent to 48.25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, I said that the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill has been one of the notable failures of this Government. It has been a notable failure because it has been founded entirely on the wrong principle. The principle upon which we base taxation has always been that the person who receives the benefit pays the income tax. Payment is made in lieu of services, for the provision of goods, or for whatever reason. The fundamental principle in this society has been that those who receive the payment pay the tax. Yet the fringe benefits tax is levied against the donor, it is levied against the employer, and not against the person who receives the benefit. That produces some major distortions within the economy. At the end of the day it does not achieve its simple objective, namely, to make sure that people who receive an income do not pay income tax at a lower level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition fully supports the closure of income tax evasion loopholes and the strengthening of the income tax rules. However, we also believe that it is quite wrong to give tacit support to what is, in effect, a reduction in liability for income tax by taxing the donor&mdash;the employer&mdash;rather than taxing the recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the fringe benefits tax has been a financial success for this big spending Government. It has raised more money than the Government ever anticipated when it first introduced it. In that sense, the Bill has clearly been a success, but it is purely an additional taxing vehicle; it is something which adds to the very great complexity of income tax law in this country because the Bill is not simple to administer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention briefly without expanding on it that the fringe benefits tax is largely avoided in the cities. The friends of Mr Keating, the forex traders and the young upwardly mobile professionals in Sydney and Melbourne are still paying income tax on low incomes of about $40,000 while their direct returns might be well over $100,000, $120,000 or $150,000. They are still getting their school fees paid, expensive cars, accommodation with interest payments on their housing loans through the company, holidays for their wives and themselves, and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are paying are the shareholders in the companies. The owners of the companies, whether they are private individuals or shareholders, are the people who are paying for those benefits. It is fundamentally wrong to persist with that sort of system in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax is having a big effect on rural Australia, which is enormously important to us. It has a hidden effect which is not seen by many people in this Parliament. Rural activity is very important to our economy. It is the very big export earning bloc after minerals. It probably provides 38 per cent to 40 per cent of Australia's export income. The effects of the fringe benefits tax on rural Australia are very high. The tax has two important effects: things are pretty tough in the country at present, and they will be for some time in the future, and the requirement to pay a fringe benefits tax puts many marginal producers below the line. </PARA>

I therefore ask the Minister: in view of reports in the United States that `virtually every major bank in the world' has been involved in funding Saddam Hussein through BNL Atlanta and in view of the Commonwealth Bank's close and direct affiliation with BNL, has the Reserve Bank or any law enforcement agency investigated the possible involvement of Australian banks in conduiting funds to Saddam Hussein's weapons development program? Has any investigation been undertaken concerning possible involvement of Australian banks with the Bank of Commerce and Credit International? If such investigations have occurred, will the Minister advise the Senate of the findings, and did such investigations include a search of the so-called `Grey Books'? If such investigations have not occurred, can the Minister advise the Senate why?

Improvements to prudential supervision are part of the process of extending superannuation coverage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one or two points about the prudential supervision which is required. Occupational superannuation standards provide protection for members' funds. For example, there are restrictions on loans to members, on borrowings by superannuation funds and on the types of investments that can be undertaken by the funds. Superannuation funds are not required to meet the Government's standards. However, the Government gives access to taxation concessions only to funds which comply with those standards. If a superannuation trustee breaches the Government's operating standards, it stands to lose its concessional tax status, which is a huge and significant loss for a fund. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there are the normal obligations on trustees under trust law to act in an honest manner and in the best interests of the beneficiaries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in February 1991, the Commonwealth offered a total of $11.4m in unmatched funds to the States. Ten per cent of the funds were to be paid on signature with the other 90 per cent payable on the basis of an agreed State plan. South Australia was the only State in a position to accept the offer at that time. Subsequently, participation agreements were signed by Queensland in May, Victoria in May, New South Wales in June and Western Australia in July. So Senator Giles can see that the implementation of the program is proceeding. A further $860,000 has been paid to South Australia, which has largely financed a new central assessment centre and State coordination unit for that State. Other unmatched funds will be paid once State plans and budgets have been agreed to between the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Giles also asked about the speedy availability of drugs for health problems concerning women. There has been a very real recognition in the Government of the need to ensure that community expectations for access in a speedy and timely way to drugs that are available internationally should be met by their availability in the Australian market. For that reason, our former colleague, now Professor Peter Baume, produced a report to which the Government has responded very quickly. Indeed, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991 was passed by the Senate last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst women's interests were not the only factor, stimulus or catalyst for pursuing that reform, they were certainly well to the fore.

Or, to use Mr Smart Alex Downer's comments in the House of Representatives a fortnight ago: `We did none of these things before because we didn't have the guts'. That was said by the Liberals' own shadow Minister. He was right: the Liberals did none of these things before because they did not have the guts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In so far as anybody could make any sense out of that question, it would be utterly improper of me to discuss in the detail Senator Tambling wants what are very important internal commercial matters for the Gagudju Association. I am aware that Gagudju has been considering the investments that it has in tourism infrastructure in Kakadu National Park for some time and that it has engaged, as in my view it should have, a number of external sources of advice. So far as Mr Holding's association with that matter is concerned, I am aware&mdash;and Senator Tambling knows this&mdash;that not only Clyde but also his wife, Judy Holding, have been close friends of many of the Aboriginal people, some in particular who are executive members of the Gagudju Association.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>One reason for the urgency of this motion is the incredible fact that within 24 hours the Australian Labor Party could elect as Prime Minister of Australia the former discredited Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating. I refer to the wise words of Senator Jim McKiernan, JP, Labor senator for Western Australia, who last week said, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now 900,700 reasons why Paul Keating should not be elected Prime Minister of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The man who gave us the recession that we `had to have' should not now be rewarded for his accomplishment. It is amazing that the shell-shocked Labor Party, so determined to hold on to power at any price, would reward the architect of the recession, the person who has ruined so many thousands of Australian lives, and give him as a reward for that inept economic leadership the highest office in government. I remind the Senate of the words of Mr Paul Keating earlier this year on an SBS television program, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think loyalty is the stuff of politics. Political parties are built on loyalty. Loyalty is the common thread, I think, which runs through the political organisation, and organisation matters. It matters to me.</PARA>
<PARA>Paul Keating has shown no loyalty to his leader, a leader who has described Mr Keating as treacherous, although at that time he was party to a treacherous act on the Australian people; he has shown no loyalty to his Party, and with Senator Richardson he has been helping to totally undermine and destabilise it; he has shown no loyalty to his principles, as we saw the other day when he was prepared to sell out those principles to the Labor Left down in Victoria, when he sought the support of those such as Wally Curran and John Halfpenny&mdash;for but a few votes; and he has shown no loyalty to the ordinary Australian people who have suffered reducing standards of living under his economic tutelage and who have now lost their jobs and are looking forward to a miserable Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the political manipulator extraordinaire whose only loyalty has been to `the family'&mdash;the New South Wales Labor Right, in relation to which one of its Labor Party colleagues, Mr Gayler, said earlier this year that this faction known for its particular form of thuggery is about the only loyalty that he has known and, with a continuation of that thuggery, it is now almost about to achieve its ultimate objective of putting Mr Keating into the Lodge as Prime Minister of this country. That would be a total travesty of justice, and that is why we have moved this motion this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people will never forgive Mr Paul Keating, the architect of the recession, for the unnecessary misery he has caused so many hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians. They will never forget the Labor Party that rewards him for that disservice to the Australian people. Why is the Labor Party about to undertake this desperate act? Is it because it so despises the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, or is it because Mr Keating and his henchmen will undermine the Party, and continually undermine it, until they achieve their objective, no matter what the consequence? If it is the latter, it means that he is achieving that objective, despite the best interests of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could not be his economic credentials that are moving his Party in this direction. I remind honourable senators that he said that there would be no recession; he then said that we were likely to skirt a significant recession; he then said that this was the recession that we `had to have'; and he then said that there would be a modest recovery, projected to emerge earlier in the year 1991. He was the Treasurer who gave us inflation rates constantly above the OECD average; he was the Treasurer who gave us interest rates a giant 5 1/4 per cent higher than the OECD average during his years as Treasurer; and he is the one who expounded the J-curve, which became an S-bend, with the collapse of the Australian dollar in 1986. No-one could stand and defend his economic record, at a time when a million Australians are out of work and when another 500,000 Australian have either given up looking for work or, alternatively, cannot get full employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he does not have economic credentials, what does he have to justify the decision that it appears the Labor Party is about to take?  The only answer can be that he has the capacity to manipulate. As the former Treasurer said, he has the capacity to flick to vaudeville if that is necessary to achieve his objective. Is his capacity in some way to convince the Australian people that something is true when it is clearly untrue purely the reason he is about to be promoted to this high office?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said a moment ago that Christmas is but a week away&mdash;a time which should be a joyous celebration. For a country as potentially wealthy as Australia, with a small population, a country shielded from the conflicts that exist in so much of the world and a country, which Senator Button should know from his journey overseas last week, which many continue to envy as a land of unlimited opportunity, Australians should be feeling confident and hopeful about an exciting future in the fastest growing region of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the incompetence of this Government, the incompetence of both Mr Hawke and Mr Keating and of all the hangers-on from the Right, the Left, the Centre Left and other factions, it is appalling that it will be a Christmas of misery for so many Australians. As I said, there are one million Australians on the dole queues with another half a million Australians either having given up or underemployed. We have the highest unemployment rate in 60 years, since the Great Depression of the 1930s. There have been shattered hopes and lost dreams, all as a result of incompetent Government policy. The legacy of the Hawke-Keating years will lie in its recognition as one of the worst governments in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Ministers were asked questions today about their loyalty to Mr Hawke, all they did was laugh it off and say, `We have no responsibility to Parliament. We are not going to answer those questions. We will continue to play our internal power game come what may. We will give no consideration to the misery of the hundreds of thousands of Australians over Christmas'. All the Ministers are interested in is their jobs and the job of their Prime Minister, and not the jobs of one and a half million Australians who are suffering so much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government came into office out of a drought and an economic recession which was no fault of the then government. This Labor Government experienced the good times and the periods of growth. What did we then get from it?  We got the accord, that special deal with the unions which gives the ACTU the right to expect wage increases irrespective of market expectations. We saw members of the Government, particularly Senator Richardson and Prime Minister Hawke, link themselves to that orgy of consumption and excess of the mid-1980s&mdash;the backslapping, the gladhanding and the passing of huge sums of money through to the leadership group and through to the secretariat of the Labor Party here in Canberra. We heard in the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters about the money flowing from Bond, Hancock, Goldberg, Connell, Dempster et cetera. As a result, this Government lost touch with reality. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then saw the inept economic policy of former Treasurer Keating which mercilessly crushed business through impossible interest rates. This was not just during his final year in office; from 1986 onwards we saw small business overdraft rates around 20 per cent. He was told time and time again that business could not survive in those conditions. He refused to listen, he knew better;  he was out of touch. The legacy is now mass unemployment and the misery and suffering that has resulted from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the spirit of this time of the year, we have said that our speakers will be brief, but it is important that we move this motion today because time is against us. This Labor Party in this Parliament has but a couple of days to make decisions. On the one hand, the Government could for the first time for months&mdash;some would now argue for years&mdash;concentrate on governing the country rather than conducting its own internal power play. It could bring the leadership issue to an end and say, `We are now going to face up to our responsibility as a government rather than simply look to our own jobs and our own interests'. On the other hand, the Government could allow this leadership issue to go on into the new year when the misery of Australians will increase or&mdash;the worst decision of all&mdash;it could reward the man who is so much responsible for the suffering within Australia, who is so much responsible for the economic demise of this country, and who has so nearly achieved his objective of turning Australia into a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important issue before the Government today. It is critical to Australia's future and to the ordinary Australians which those opposite claim to represent but so rarely do in fact. Members of the Government must bring this issue to an end. They must get on with the task of governing&mdash;that high responsibility which has been given to them by the people of Australia. The members of the Labor Party must put their factions and the leadership groups&mdash;the groups that have been tapping Hawke on the shoulder, then going to Keating and undermining their own side&mdash;on one side. It must be brought to an end. Those opposite must face up finally to their responsibilities as a government. If they are not prepared to do that they ought to get out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Opposition have on the table a new, comprehensive and integrated package that can provide new direction for this country and provide incentive to ordinary Australians to be able to achieve something, to bring benefits to their family and to themselves. Seven hundred pages of material are on the table as an alternative. The Government has put forward no alternative at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen three attempts made by the Government during the year with the fourth soon to come up. We have seen the industry statement that was hijacked by Mr Hawke for his own political ends from Senator Button. We have seen a `do nothing' Budget.

It is not good enough. Those opposite have either to get on with the task of governing or to get out and give us the opportunity to implement our Fightback program, which will restore hope, opportunity and incentive to ordinary Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no good uttering mindless slogans at me; listen to the argument. There are a number of reasons for the current recession in Australia. I want to remind honourable senators that the recession here is no worse in its consequences than the recession in most Anglo-Saxon countries in the world such as the United States, the United Kingdom and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Kingdom the recession was brought on under a government that followed the sorts of policies the Opposition espouses in the Fightback program. For years in here the Liberal Party argued the great virtues of Margaret Thatcher. What the Liberals really liked about Margaret Thatcher was that she had guts and the Liberals as an Opposition and a government lacked guts; a statement which is proved out of the mouth of the Opposition spokesman on trade, Mr Alex&mdash;Smart Alex&mdash;Downer, when he said a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives that that was why the Opposition had never done any of these things itself&mdash;the Opposition had never tackled any of the hard issues because it lacked guts as a political party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for years the Liberal Party espoused and admired the policies of Margaret Thatcher. Now the Liberal Opposition has adopted them as a blueprint solution to Australia's economic problems, which they are not. The Opposition has got very excited about that and about the fact that there is a deep recession in this country. I want to settle the Opposition down a little if I can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the Australian recession is, of course, distinct from the recessions in the United States, in the United Kingdom and so on for several particular reasons. Two of the particular reasons are access to markets for our rural products and the crisis in major rural industries such as the wool industry. Does any Opposition senator have the nerve to pretend that the crisis in the wool industry is the responsibility of this Government? Does any Opposition senator have the nerve to pretend that? That crisis is not the responsibility of the Government, and the Opposition spokesman, Mr McLachlan, recognises that. He had more guts than the rest of the Opposition senators when the wool crisis came along. There is a severe crisis in the rural industries, which are the great industries of Australia, and that has contributed significantly to the recession in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue is the behaviour of the financial sector following the excesses of the 1980s which have imposed a credit squeeze on many businesses in Australia at present. Throughout these problems the process of adjustment to the Australian economy has gone on, and that is not an issue the Opposition really addresses at all in those 600 pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exporter can look through that document to try to find out what the Fightback proposal will do for him. It may make a marginal difference to his input costs if the goods and services tax is introduced. If he is a rich man it will make more than a marginal difference because the rich will get big tax cuts under the Opposition's proposal; the poor will not. That is a fact which is spelt out in black and white in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, and that is something upon which people can rely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Proportionately, that is not right', says Senator Hill. I am simply making the point that it is a regressive taxation system. There is no doubt about that. Looking at all the indicators in the Fightback program, which I will come to in a moment, one can see this similar pattern being revealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion talks about the leadership crisis in the ALP, which is a regrettable and sad thing. It secondly goes on to talk about the self-imposed economic crisis, which is half true. On numerous occasions at Question Time we have said that the application of monetary policy in 1989 and 1990 contributed to the depth of this recession. There is no doubt about that; we have said that on many occasions. So what the Opposition says about that is half true but the other half has to be considered, which is the peculiar circumstances of the Australian economy with its large contribution from the rural sector, badly damaged by access to markets, the crisis in the wool industry and so on and the quite extraordinary behaviour of the banking system in this country which is contributing to problems at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill refers to those two issues and then he says, `Well, the solution to all of this is you say to the Australian people, "We have high levels of unemployment and we, the Liberal Party, have at last found our feet and this time we will be different from all earlier Liberal governments. We will implement this program come hell or high water because we are different from previous Liberals, we've got guts and they never had guts before"'. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the Fightback program and considering the question of unemployment, the first thing one must recognise is that this package, introduced in the sort of economic circumstances we have now, will lead to higher unemployment. That is admitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) who I concede has more brains than most of the rest of the Opposition senators put together. The Leader of the Opposition has admitted that this package will lead to higher unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else will the Fightback package lead to? Very obviously higher inflation, and the Opposition knows that for certain because if the Opposition looks at its own predictions, that is quite clear. Even taking it out to the end of the decade, on the Opposition's scenarios given in table 19.1, very high levels of unemployment are predicted. But the very high levels would occur when this package is introduced because table 19.1 does not factor in the effects of the GST on these basic economic indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the Opposition's theme again; it is the Opposition's day&mdash;it is having its day in court with this motion. At the beginning when this Fightback package was launched, I said it was like a curate's egg, half bad half good and it would get badder and badder and smellier and smellier as time went by. A fortnight later some of the bugs in it are starting to emerge. Some of the criticisms from all around the place are starting to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The popularity of the Fightback package has gone down by 5 per cent. That is a pretty quick reaction to a program which the Opposition has hard sold for this period of time. The simple point is that Opposition members cannot prescribe these sort of blueprint solutions for the benefit of anybody in this community except themselves. The only jobs one can be sure might benefit from this program if the Opposition were in a position to implement it would be the Opposition's jobs, nobody else's. So that is what the Opposition is getting so excited about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has done tremendous damage to itself in overselling the Fightback package. Mr Gerard Henderson makes this point in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning. It is illustrated, for example, by the Opposition's projections on the uncovering of tax cheating with this package and the suggestion in the Fightback package that $4 billion would be recovered from that process. Mr Reith and others are on record as saying, `Scratch an Australian and you'll find a cheat' and all that sort of stuff. It is not pretty nice stuff to say about the average Australian. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two months ago Mr Reith was saying that $40 billion would be recovered from this. The alternative Treasurer of a potential Liberal government was saying that $40 billion would be recovered from Australia's black economy. It went down suddenly from $40 billion to $4 billion when those opposite hit the cold light of day and actually had to release it in black and white. This was said by the potential Treasurer of Australia. He is the man who multiplies projected figures by 10. That is how rubbery the figures of an alternative government are in this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three issues are: one, the leadership. I am afraid those opposite cannot do anything about that; I guess we have to. The second is the self-imposed economic crisis. That is a half-true allegation. Over a period I have said that there is some truth in that. Thirdly, there are the great virtues of the Fightback program, which are a solution to all the problems which this country is presently confronting and which, I am sad to say, it will have to continue to confront for some time to come because of the need to adjust a whole range of firms and industries to compete in the world, which Australia was not used to doing. Most Australians who think seriously about it know that that is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the old Fightback program does not address many of those issues. It is all about a tax-led recovery: a `greed is good' led recovery. These are the sorts of slogans and mental attitudes of the 1980s; they are not appropriate to a country confronting these problems in the 1990s.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The lack of clarity with which the Opposition approaches the future is well exemplified by the way in which Senator Hill approached his motion, the wording of which is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate calls on Labor to end the leadership farce which has left Australia without effective government at a time of self imposed economic crisis and to urgently adopt the Coalition's visionary `Fightback' program in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Most of what Senator Hill had to say was really aimed at Mr Keating's performance, the presumptive Labor Party leader, should its leadership change. It is quite clear from that that the Opposition, in framing its motion, is not concerned about this country's plight as a consequence of the leadership wrangle but is far more intent on damaging the reputation of the person whom it sees as possibly the new leader of both Labor and this country within the next few days. That is really doing more damage to this country to the extent that it is effective. Unless the Opposition is capable of wording motions and speaking to them with greater clarity, greater precision, it is really not presenting itself in a way that will enjoin much sympathy or support from the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As Senator Spindler pointed out the other day, the situation in Germany in the 1930s was not that dissimilar from Australia's situation today, in that there was then 30 per cent youth unemployment. There was a high level of unemployment. While inflation was high, which is not true in Australia, other economic factors made the plight of German people really quite desperate. It was similar to the situation in Australia today. If one looks at history one sees quite clearly that in times such as that the electorate turns to what appears to be a way out without looking too closely at what has been offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agreed with Senator Button when he described the Fightback package as lacking substance. The Democrats also believe that there is a very considerable element of legerdemain involved in that package. When one looks at precise ways in which unemployment&mdash;Senator Button mentioned this&mdash;will be addressed and precise ways in which the economy will be improved, one finds an ideological belief in the operation of free and unfettered markets to deliver the goods, with very little substance in relation to precisely what goods will be delivered, to whom and when. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings the Democrats to a criticism which we make both of the Government and of the Opposition. I remind the Senate yet again that Mr Howard, then the shadow Treasurer, said that Mr Keating, then the Treasurer, had had his reform package accepted so easily precisely because the package that Labor was implementing was based on Liberal Party policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have Tweedledum and Tweedledee, as a former Leader of the Democrats has described them. Labor has been pursuing deregulation, leaving it to the markets, with some slight reticence because it has been held back by some of its more traditional Labor forces. The Liberal-National Party coalition simply wants to take that same package further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances which have led Australia to its present condition of high unemployment and massive foreign indebtedness will simply not be benefited by the Fightback package. Unregulated markets simply cannot deliver a vision; unregulated markets leave it to the very people who are, to a considerable extent, responsible for this country's plight. The Bonds, the Skases and the others who have borrowed massively overseas, who have bought well established Australian industries, have gone down the gurgler. Those industries have then passed into foreign hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing in the Fightback package indicates that the Opposition, if it gets power, will re-regulate banking. Senator Button admitted that the deregulation of banking, together with the deregulation of foreign exchange, was one of the significant factors leading this country to its present predicament. Nothing in the Fightback package suggests that the Opposition will do anything different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of a piece which Ross Gittins wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> about 10 days ago. He pointed out that Dr Hewson was economic adviser to former Prime Minister Fraser and was providing the sort of advice that led this country to its predicament immediately before Labor took over. The Ross Gittins line&mdash;I agree with him&mdash;was that Dr Hewson is suggesting solutions to problems which were faced unsuccessfully through the 1970s and into the early 1980s. In other words, Dr Hewson is suggesting old solutions to old problems and is ignoring the fact that, as any observation would indicate, those solutions, even to the old problems, simply did not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button pointed out that similar conditions obtain throughout quite a number of countries in the Western industrialised world at the present time. He instanced the United Kingdom and the United States. Of course, it is absolutely true. The United Kingdom Government under Margaret Thatcher followed the same deregulatory ideology, the same leave it to the market ideology, as that which has been pursued by the Labor Government with Mr Hawke as captain and Mr Keating as navigator, and which has landed this country on the rocks. Again, I can only stress that accession to government by the Opposition, should that occur and should we see an attempted implementation of this Fightback package, would do nothing whatsoever to address the very serious problems, because fundamentally, ideologically and philosophically the Opposition and the Government are pursuing the same course, but simply with different degrees of vigour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill drew attention to the way in which the Government was presenting unreal solutions or no solutions to the present problems. Of course, one area in which that is absolutely evident, and one that indicates the abysmal lack of vision of both the Government and the Opposition at the present time, is the proposal to build a multifunction polis in Australia. The Government has maintained that the MFP will be the largest development ever undertaken in this country, running into multi-billions of dollars. The vision is that Australian research and development is no good, that we need to import our research and development from overseas and that somehow, through building this MFP over the next 15 or 20 years or so, Australian industry will be led out of the valley of desolation and destruction into which it has been taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Opposition senators recognise the MFP as a mirage. Yet, when I moved in this place a motion to remove the expenditure of millions of dollars on this mirage under the Budget allocations, the Opposition simply moved away from that. The Opposition is not serious about presenting an alternative vision, one in which much of the leading first-class research in this country is supported by government, not damaged by government, and turned into useful and productive enterprises. In recent days we have seen the neutralisis process in Brisbane, which is a way of dealing with urban and other wastes, put up for sale. This technology has simply not been supported. Despite the fact that it is eminently evident to anybody with eyes that it is a technology which not only Australia but also the world needs, it has been allowed to remain unsupported and the company will be lost to this country. Similarly, the Memtec technology has gone offshore, as has the solar thermal technology, where we have the leading technology in the world. These are the sorts of things which clearly direct our attention towards where this country, and where the world, needs to move&mdash;where we have leading-edge technology and where government needs to recognise the vision. But neither the Government nor the Opposition has either the vision or the economic policies which can lead to a fulfilment of that vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to move back from the brink towards the Government's putting its hand firmly back on the levers of economic control. We are the elected representatives of the people and we should not leave it to those naked, greedy market forces in the community to determine the shape of Australian society in the future&mdash;something which both the Government and the Opposition are driven to do by the ideological belief in the market as a way of relating people in a society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that many parts of the economy need to be selectively re-regulated and that government control should be imposed for the benefit of the people of this country. As long as we continue to go down the deregulated road and leave the Australian economy locked into those of other countries, we will lose control of our economy. We will simply throw up our hands, as Mr Keating often did as Treasurer, and say, `It is not my fault; it is the fault of the recession in the US or the recession in the UK' or `It is a failure of the markets here or the failure of the markets there'. We need to control the economy in this country for the benefit of Australians. We will only do that when this Government, or the government of this country, places its hands firmly on the levers of economic control once again. </PARA>

We saw Mr Keating put out in the press and the electronic media the story of his meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), both having referees. Mr Keating told us that the Prime Minister gave a firm commitment that he would get the gong. Mr Keating was very upset when the Prime Minister reneged on his promise.

What was Senator Button's answer to that? It was to cut tariffs when every other nation was increasing subsidies. When every other nation was increasing protection, we cut our tariffs. The effect of that was that Australia became a net importer of more and more goods, and that drove the trade deficit up every year. The latest rural figures, released today, reflect a sad state of affairs for rural Australia.

The Labor Party cannot get a base much lower than 30 per cent. Every party must retain or hold some base. The Labor Party's base is 30 per cent.

Why would they not walk away from this Government? They have done so because the Government has walked away from them and has not given them a thought. How can any government say that it supports the family when it increases interest rates on homes? How can it say that it supports rural industry and small business when it has allowed interest rates to run at 23 per cent and imposed a 3 per cent surcharge? Very few businesses can sustain those interest rates. The Government has run along with that policy. How can anyone export, be it a primary producer, a small business person, a manufacturer or a mining company, when the Australian dollar is running at US81c? That is the confusion and paralysis in which this Government finds itself. It has given no leadership whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>

When told by her that he was drunk, Winston Churchill retorted that he might be drunk but she was ugly. He then went on to say, `I will be sober in the morning but you will still be ugly'. I am reminded of that story because today we are presented with a motion which is critical of a government for going through a process which I am sure we would all rather not be going through. But at the end of the day the Opposition will have to live with its policy prescription for the duration of this Government's term and into the next election. It is one that I am sure the Australian public will not find attractive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Button has indicated, we are going through a recession; that is not denied. It is part of a worldwide recession; that is not denied. In some respects, we are different from the rest of the world in that we are doing two things: we are having to live through a rural recession and, importantly, at long last, structural change is occurring throughout our community. We are now going through change that should have evolved over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our challenge is to respond to the recession and particularly to unemployment. All of us in this place have to realise that we should not expect the Australian people to believe that there is an easy answer. There is no easy answer. To the extent that parties in this place suggest that there is, I tend to agree with Senator Coulter that they will be exposed and are being exposed for their dishonesty. As a consequence, maybe minor parties are picking up voters and supporters. This is reflected in the polls as well as in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question we have to ask is: who is best able to take us through this recession and who has the best policy prescription? On our side there is not only a commitment to getting out of the recession and meeting the challenge of unemployment but also a commitment which is based on the principles of social justice. We believe that those who suffer in this recession should be protected as much as possible as we fight our way through it. I say unequivocally on behalf of this Government that it is our priority to get through this recession and reduce unemployment in a way that best suits our social justice policies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a fraud! Opposition senators came into the chamber and raised a matter of urgency. They then called a quorum but not one extra Opposition senator came into the chamber. Not only that, just before the quorum was called Senator Knowles looked and made sure&mdash;we all noticed it&mdash;that four Liberal senators walked out of this chamber, including the person who raised this matter of urgency. They vacated the chamber in order to ensure that a quorum could be called. If this matter is so urgent, let us have consistency. If it is so urgent, let us not have this sign of hypocrisy. If it is so urgent, why are Opposition senators not here in the chamber responding to this matter of urgency? They are a fraud and, as I was saying at the start of my contribution, they will be exposed as such through their package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has offered the Australian people nothing more than a poisoned toffee apple. There is lots of toffee and gloss on the outside, but the people are licking at it to their disaffection. They are finding that it is riddled with poison on the inside. Let us have a look at this package. What is the Opposition offering? It is offering an economic miracle; an economic vision. But this proposal has been tried before; it has been tried and it has failed. It was tried in the UK and it failed; it was tried in New Zealand and it failed; and it was tried in the US and it failed. If one talks to any leading world statesmen about this package of consumption tax, one will find that they do not believe a party could be so foolhardy and inequitable in its policy projection as to do what the Opposition is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Opposition doing in its proposal? It is reducing the tax on guns, perfume and jewellery but increasing the tax on food and clothes. The Opposition is reducing the tax on Audi GLs, Mercedes and those sorts of cars, but it is increasing it by the same amount on a family home. Under the Opposition's proposal, Australian workers and the Australian business community will be worse off. There is no vision for them in the package as it has been proposed. What vision does it offer for the Australian workers who will have their rights totally dismantled; what vision does it offer for migrants, students or the women in our community; and what vision does it offer pensioners and country people?  I am offended by Senator Boswell coming in here as the Leader of the National Party of Australia&mdash;a country-based party&mdash;and denying the fact that his constituency will be worst hit by this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the broad areas, what vision do we find for the arts or the environment? Absolutely none; only cutbacks. What vision for industry is in the package? There is the vision of being bound in red tape. Let us talk about efficiency: 2.2 billion companies will have to fill out forms as a result of the Opposition's little idea of a consumption tax, of which 70,000 may in the end have to pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a computer-driven policy, the main beneficiaries being those in the computer industry who will have to sell their computers to something like two million companies in our community. Those opposite may babble over there, but the people who will be hit most will be the small businesses and they are finding that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no vision in this policy proposal. But I will go through a number of economic parameters. We are accused of conceding the fight against inflation at the expense of unemployment. Those who are making that accusation in the community and those who are making it in here ought to understand full well that our commitment has brought inflation down to 3 per cent. Those on the other side will blindly, mindlessly and cold-heartedly reduce it to 2 per cent. How much more unemployment is implicit in that proposal? One then needs to take into account the Opposition's high road proposal, as set out in its package, for two million more jobs by the year 2000. That alternative has already been disowned by the Opposition. In fact, it was disowned in the Opposition's policy document where it says that a job creation program of two million jobs in the next 10 years does not purport to portray the outcomes which would be achieved by implementation of that package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are criticised for keeping interest rates too high, but every decrease in interest rates over the recent terms of this Government has been criticised by Dr Hewson as being `politically motivated'. I do not think his blind, mindless and ill-based policy to remove the Reserve Bank of Australia from any influence of government will do anything but lead to higher interest rates. I am sure this is recognised in the community, and those opposite understand that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are criticised for allowing the Budget deficit to increase to the tune of about $5m this financial year. I am saying these sorts of things because it indicates how hard the job is. It also indicates that there is no miracle answer to these problems. We are criticised for allowing the Budget deficit to blow out, but at the same time we are criticised for not ploughing enough funds into infrastructure. This is the twin attack from the Opposition. There is no consistency; it is full of hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned unemployment, but the Opposition's document gives a lie to the sort of promotion that was given to the package at the start. It was promoted like a US basketball game, with probably less social utility. The Opposition's employment objectives have already been exposed as being inadequate. We are also criticised for our policies in respect of the manufacturing sector and its protection against imports. We have a phase-down policy. The Opposition has indicated very loudly and very stridently that its policy is not phase-down; it is total phase-out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, there is no vision in this policy, for a number of reasons. The basic reason is that this policy is based on inequity. Secondly, it does not stand up in a macro sense. It is in fact a con for most workers in the community; the jobs claim is a con. More importantly, we are talking about a policy which has been well promoted, well packaged and well pushed by the Opposition, but it is a package which has some major gaps. The Opposition has no wages policy, but it has a very direct high inflation policy and a very direct high interest rate policy. It is no wonder that social commentators such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catholic Weekly</EMPHASIS> and Archbishop Peter Hollingworth from the Anglican Church in Brisbane are on record as indicating that this policy is inequitable. But, more than that, it has major holes at the macro level and major holes at the micro level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will get over our particular problem&mdash;and the sooner we do the better for this country. It is very much the objective of everyone on this side of the chamber to go to the next election with an honest policy to redress the recession. But we will not wait until then; the wheels are in motion to achieve that aim before we go to the next election. Senator Knowles may be happy here today being a parasite on our problems, but we will get over those. We will sober up in the morning, but she will still be ugly with her package. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate calls on Labor to end the leadership farce which has left Australia without effective government at a time of self imposed economic crisis and to urgently adopt the Coalition's visionary `Fightback' program in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>We are meant to be talking about the leadership farce within the Australian Labor Party, yet Senator Bolkus and Senator Button, in both their contributions, have made a lame duck attempt to try to say that our policy&mdash;the Fightback program&mdash;is inadequate. However, we have asked constantly for three to four weeks, `What is your alternative?'. Not one Minister has been able to come into this chamber, not one Minister has gone public and not one member of the Government has gone out to the public to say, `This will be our policy'. Yet last week people from the Government said time in time out that they needed a redirection of policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are absolutely rudderless. They are wasting taxpayers' money trying to blow our package out of the water, yet at no stage have they got Treasury to concentrate on re-evaluating the direction of this country or on redirecting their own failed policies. The latest Treasurer, Mr Willis, has admitted that the policy direction is wrong and that it will have to be revamped. But what do those opposite have Treasury doing? Treasury is sitting over there trying to blow our policy out of the water, although those opposite do not have one policy alternative to put to the people of Australia. They do not have one policy alternative to put to the more than one million people who are out of work. They do not have one policy alternative to put to all the people who are going bankrupt. They do not have one policy alternative to put to all the people who are struggling this Christmas and who face absolute uncertainty in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not time that this Government solved this leadership crisis and got on with the job of redirecting and changing its policies to come up with something different as its vision for Australia? Senator Bolkus's contribution was nothing but absurd. He talked about hypocrisy. Let us look at the hypocrisy. He claims that our vision in the Fightback package lacks detail. But where is the Government's detail? We have produced nearly 700 pages of detail. But all those opposite are worried about is the Labor Party; all they are worried about is Mr Keating and Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On not one occasion, in all the interviews that every member of the Labor Party has been prepared to give in the last week about the leadership crisis, have I heard one of them talk about the need to solve this problem for the sake of the country. They have talked long and hard about Mr Hawke; they have talked long and hard about Mr Keating; they have talked long and hard about winning government; they have talked long and hard about the Labor Party; but not once have they talked about the sake of this country. Is it not about time they started to do so? This Government is just a scandal and a national disaster. The country's future has simply been sacrificed for Mr Keating and Mr Hawke&mdash;both as bad as each other; both with egos one could not even jump over&mdash;while the numbers are being played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus chucked a tantrum because a quorum was called on him this afternoon. The reason I called a quorum was that there had not been one Labor senator in this chamber since Question Time. The Leader of the Government in the Senate had to speak to an empty chamber&mdash;other than Opposition senators&mdash;because not one person was prepared to support him. Senator Bolkus was exactly the same. We just thought we would test the waters to see how many of his colleagues would come in to support him. Sure, they came in to make up a quorum, but they left 30 seconds later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite should not talk to us about the need for this urgency motion. We see cowardice at the moment in Ministers who will not stand up for what they believe in. The Prime Minister has a huge ego. In his words he is still the greatest; he is still the one who can win; he is the only one with policies&mdash;we would like to see them, would we not?&mdash;and he is the one who will not go. Senator Bolkus was one of the wimps who went along to the Prime Minister the other day and said, `Come on, Bob, I think it's time; I think your time's up'. Yet the Prime Minister just pushed the six of them aside and said, `Not now, sonny boys; I am staying because I am the one who can win'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is Senator Button on about? Why does Senator Button not stand by his convictions? Why does Senator Button not do something? It is Senator Button who gave Mr Hayden the flick in favour of Mr Hawke eight or nine years ago. The irony of it is that when Senator Button saw fit to give Mr Hayden the flick, Mr Hayden was 17 points above where Mr Hawke is today. Why does not Senator Button go to Mr Hawke and say, `Shove it, sonny boy, you are off'? It is about time that Australians were able to get a clear policy direction. It is about time that this Government took stock of what it is doing, got all this rot out of the way and started governing the country. But no, the numbers game is more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, Australians have the right to question the judgment of the Prime Minister and the judgment of Mr Keating. Back in March last year the Prime Minister said that there was no need to fear a recession in any sense. What an outrageous statement that was. Then, of course, he promised a recovery by mid-1991&mdash;this year&mdash;and we know what happened to that. He promised to hand over the leadership to Paul Keating; another broken promise. He breaks promises as far as the electorate is concerned and he breaks promises as far as his colleagues are concerned. Where is the propriety of this man?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the Prime Minister nor his Government are capable of leading this country out of the depression we are in today. What sort of loyalty is he commanding from this Government at the moment when 12 out of 15 of his Cabinet colleagues say that he should walk the plank? Quite frankly, for this country, the sooner the better. But where is the courage of the convictions of the Ministers who sit on the front benches of both Houses of this Parliament? It is not to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, is quoted as saying that the Prime Minister is `just sand on the highways and byways of politics', and `Bob will show respect for the Labor Party' in the end. Is that not nice? How about respect for the people of Australia? Is it not about time that the people of Australia were shown some respect by these people? No. All they are worried about is the Labor Party; all they are worried about is Mr Keating; all they are worried about is Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Land Transport, Mr Bob Brown, said that the only way the leadership crisis can be resolved is by the elevation of the honourable member for Blaxland, Mr Keating.

If we refer to supplementary paper No. 1, which is the employment paper attached to the Opposition's document that contains those projections, and if we go to option C, which is the higher road scenario, the maximum employment to be generated, we find that the Opposition's own documents assert that 1.527 million jobs&mdash;I think I am correct&mdash;that is, one and a half million jobs, will be created by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, as Senator Macdonald has now conceded publicly on radio&mdash;today, I think, in northern Australia&mdash;he was wrong. The items he has mentioned have a 10 per cent wholesale sales tax on them, which the Opposition is going to remove and replace with a whopping 15 per cent retail tax, which is a tax not just on the wholesale price of the product but on the retail mark-up as well. That shows that the claim by the Opposition is totally deceitful. The prices of these important items for ordinary domestic consumers in northern Australia are going to increase, not decrease.

The Opposition has promised to increase zone allowances by 25 per cent in northern Australia and has touted this as being a really big benefit to people in northern Australia. Let me tell them what it actually means for people in northern Australia. Residents in zone B, which is the most populous zone&mdash;that is, the zone in which most people get paid&mdash;currently are paid $45 a year in zone allowances, and that is going to increase under the Opposition to $56.25. That is an increase in taxation zone allowance of $11.25 per year. Well, hold the back page! In a transcript from ABC radio on Tuesday, regarding zone rebates, this is what</PARA>

Now you put all those things together I think that's very important that we recognise that we have been very conscious of the problem with Far North Queensland. On the $48-00&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is not $48; it is $45&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not sure what that number is but I'm talking about the Zone Rebates offered in the personal tax.</PARA>

<PARA>Dr Hewson must have been well briefed, because this is a key subject in northern Australia and has been for years, but he indicated that he knows nothing about the current regime of zone allowances up there and was totally ignorant of the fact that this wonderful gift that the Opposition is giving us in northern Australia amounts for the majority of us to a total increase in zone rebates of $11.25 a year.

What a team to defend the Government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button is the person who has a reputation for going into boardrooms of this country, into industry, and agreeing with everyone that things are bad, that things need to be done, that labour relations need to be improved, and that taxation measures need to be introduced. He has been agreeing with people in industry conscientiously, with crocodile tears running down his face&mdash;and coming out of boardrooms and not doing a thing for them. He got away with it for some years, but he has not got away with it for many years. This is precisely the same attitude Senator Button takes to his Leader. The man who stabbed Mr Hayden in the back&mdash;held the knife, ran it in&mdash;is doing the same thing now to the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. It is great to have people like that in responsible positions at the top of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for Senator Bolkus, I do not think we need to spend much time on him. And as to Senator Collins, I would invite him to read the Fightback package.

So we will leave the issue at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Zonal allowances are a very real thing in rural Australia, particularly in the northern parts. Senator Collins might recollect that this Government has been in office now for nearly nine years. It has never done one darn thing for zonal allowances, and never has an intention of doing so. We have this Government which is detested and distrusted completely by the Australian community. It is no longer seen as a capable government; it has not been seen as a capable government for many years. It is seen now as a totally irresponsible government in the literal sense where the leaders of the Government are squabbling like small children over the toys, which to them are the fruits of office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Prime Minister who does not now enjoy the support of his colleagues, and we have a pretender to the throne who is clearly no better placed at all. All the time Australia is swinging deeper and deeper into a major depression. There is real pain and hurt out there. If people such as Senator Collins took themselves out onto the footpaths of the cities of Australia&mdash;Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;and went through the country towns, and talked to people, they would realise the pain and agony that is out in the community with the failed businesses, the huge rate of bankruptcies, the failed careers, the failed marriages, the failed families, and even the suicide levels that are tragically now so much part of the Australian scene; and they relate to the policies of Senator Collins&mdash;who is now slinking out&mdash;his Government and his colleagues in the Cabinet. </PARA>

The country is seen to be directionless. It is a mendicant country with a huge debt; it is absolutely helpless. This Government is seen to have squandered the immense resources of the country and frittered away the golden opportunities we had. What do we get? There is not a word of constructive inspiration out of these Ministers who sit on the leather on the other side. We just get squabbles over who will be the leader and who will be in the Ministry in the changed leadership. We have a government that is absolutely incapable of being able to learn from its mistakes or even to recognise that it has made mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is blind to the fact that it is the custodian for the time being of the national interests of Australia. It is exhausted morally, intellectually and politically. We have a Ministry that is unable to govern. Look at Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence: he has been so busy this year trying to protect the Prime Minister that he has not devoted his not inconsiderable talents to his Ministry at all. He has left it all to that lightweight in the other place, his junior Minister who lacks the intellectual and professional background to understand the portfolio. The many policy decisions that Senator Ray should have taken have not been taken because he has been too busy looking after the back of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray had a few cheap shots at the Liberal Party in Question Time today. I would like to take him down a little bit of an historical path also and reflect on the history of Labor governments. The history of Labor governments in Australia is a history of catastrophic failure&mdash;not peccadilloes anywhere along the line but major failures. Look at Whitlam who gave us the great inflation and unemployment of the post-Second World War era. Look at Chifley. There were four years after the Second World War of absolute misery, of price control and all the black market rackets that went with it. There was petrol rationing, and austerity, which is what it used to be called.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the rest of the world was booming away in those years, 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1949, Australia was just wallowing in the misery of a Labor administration. Before that, in the 1930s, we had the marvellous Scullin Government which gave us the biggest depression this country had ever seen, with 30 per cent unemployment. The Labor Ministry now preens itself that unemployment is only 10 per cent, running up to 11 per cent. But the facts of life are that youth unemployment at present is near 30 per cent. In many parts of Melbourne and the industrial towns of Australia the unemployment level would be nudging what it was in the Great Depression. That is a history of Labor governments in Australia. At the end of the day, Labor can run an economy only when times are good, when there is money in the bank and when it can rob the larder and spend money recklessly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at where we are in Australia today. The mood out on the streets and the footpaths has not come about in the last three or four months; it has been building for about three years. Over the past three years when I have talked to families in my own State, Queensland, who have been in business for four or five generations and who are financially secure and who have no overdraft or anything like that, they say that they simply do not see the point of staying in businesses that are profitable, albeit at a reduced level, because they just despair at the policies of this Government and the way those policies have been foisted on the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key words to describe the Australian community today are despair and disillusionment. The atmosphere is very different from the end of the catastrophic Whitlam regime in 1974-75. In those years there was a great deal of anti-Labor feeling in the Australian community but it was one of anger and fear because we had all those loony, unexplained, irrational changes being foisted on Australian society with great rapidity by the Cairns, the Connors, the Creans, the Khemlanis and all the other luminaries who flocked to Whitlam like moths to a bright light. The view then clearly was that it was the inmates who were running the lunatic asylum, and the public got rid of them. But now the view of the community is that the inmates are running the morgue and they want to bring back the undertaker. Why ever would the Labor Party want to bring back Mr Keating? He is the man who gave us the recession we had to have; the man with the lovely set of figures, as each month's balance of payments blew out further and further; the man who promised us we would have a soft landing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only person who got it right in the Government was Senator McKiernan when he went on television the other night and said that there were 900,700 reasons why Mr Keating should never come back. But the Keating campaign has been supported by two groups of people. The first is the press. For a reason I do not understand, the press of Australia adores Mr Keating. It has waged the vendetta, the character assassination, against Mr Hawke that has brought him down. In the fullness of time it will get its reward, I imagine. The other group includes Senator McMullan, Senator Schacht, Senator Richardson and Senator Loosley who are looking after their own interests. They recognise that when this Government fails&mdash;as it surely will at the next election&mdash;the interregnum before another Labor administration comes along stretches into infinity because Mr Hawke has carefully destroyed the whole of the ethos and the base of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reformation of the Labor Party will be an extraordinarily difficult and protracted business. This country is absolutely fed up with this Government. Today we had the Morgan polls released where a staggering 21 per cent lead is held by the Liberal-National parties. I cannot recall, since polling started in Australia, a margin as great as that. I believe the Labor Party now is in an absolutely terminal state. In Brisbane yesterday one of the large radio stations, 4BC, did a poll with this question, `Do you want a say in the Prime Minister's survival? If so, do you want an election to show them what you think?'. Of the people who phoned in to 4BC yesterday, 65 per cent wanted the Labor Party out of office because they wanted to end the leadership squabbles that are going on. </PARA>

The sad situation is that people fail to distinguish between the two things. They think that because they have talked about an issue that is important they have actually done something important. There is a fundamental difference between the two. Nevertheless, the debate is now before us. I do not want to take much time. It was agreed that we would try to deal with this as a brief debate. I want to get on to legislation as soon as possible. But I do want to say a few things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a whole range of good arguments for why the current leadership debate in the Labor Party ought be resolved as quickly as possible. One of them is a link that is made in a very convoluted way in Senator Hill's motion. I would like to get the leadership debate out of the way so that the debate about the Opposition's alternative economic manifesto, its election manifesto, can properly focus on that and not upon these diversions, which are very frustrating for the people of Australia, particularly for those of us in the Federal parliamentary Labor Party. I want to see more attention focused on that election manifesto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think the Australian people would be well served by increased publicity about a number of elements in the package&mdash;more than I can talk about today. One of them is the fundamental nature of the goods and services tax. One of the great misleading aspects of this package is the attempt to deny that the massive transfer from direct to indirect tax is regressive. There is no way in the world that we can argue that making a major shift in the tax mix in Australia from one that is fundamentally based on income and upon capacity to pay to one that is based on expenditure, regardless of capacity to pay, is other than unfair. The unfairness is exacerbated when the income tax changes reinforce and enhance it by giving the greatest compensation to those who are already better off. The percentage increases flow not to those on middle incomes but to those on $75,000 a year&mdash;the absolute amounts even more so. There is a great fraud in the tax area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest fraud of all is in the jobs area, where absolute lies are being told. People get up in this Parliament and say that the package will create two million jobs when they know that it does not purport to say that. There is an economic scenario in the package which Access Economics thinks would create two million jobs. I am not sure that it is right but, nevertheless, it is a legitimate scenario. It bears no relationship to the package which the Liberals have put down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting unanswered questions is: why was Access Economics not asked to assess the actual package that was put forward and its consequences? It may well be that the answer is that it was asked to assess it, it did model it and the Opposition did not like the results so it did not publicise them. There are three economic scenarios assessed in the package, but none of them are the scenarios put forward by the Opposition. The Opposition has not assessed that. It has consciously decided to assess three other options. </PARA>

Another aspect of the program that is starting to emerge, and that will emerge from the analysis that will flow when we get these diversions out of the way, is what is not covered. For example, there is no attempt to match the Government's commitment to remove pensioners from the tax system by 1995. There is no reference to that in this package at all. There is no allowance for any costs involved in that. I assume that means that under a Hewson-led government pensioners could look forward to paying tax on their pensions, which, under a Labor government, they will not have to do by 1995. As time goes on, we start to focus on the things that are not in the package as well as the misleading elements of the things that are there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Different people are concerned most by different aspects of this package; that will create a debate that will take place in Australian society over the next 18 months. The matter that causes me most concern is the overall economic effects of the package. It strikes me as amazing that when looking around the world for a role model&mdash;on which economy the Opposition will choose to base the future vision it has of the Australian economy&mdash;the Opposition has chosen New Zealand. Of any economy in the world I could choose to base the future of the Australian economy on, I would not choose the New Zealand economy, which is in continuing recession. Several years after a package like the Opposition's program was introduced, there seems to be no end to that recession. It is continuing and all the predictions are that it will get worse. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, on the basis of the implementation of that package, has an approval rating of 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New Zealand we have a little picture for Australians to look at. We say, `This is the Australia that is being offered to you by Dr Hewson.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other aspects that I would like to refer to, but time will not permit. One of the key elements of this package&mdash;it has not yet had the coverage that it deserves; it does not get much coverage in the package&mdash;is the industrial relations element. That is a matter for another debate on another day. It is a very important and fundamental aspect that will make Australia less fair. Even the high road&mdash;the most optimistic road in the package&mdash;is based upon a reduction in real wages. All the scenarios assume a reduction in real wages. It is an administrative nightmare both for the Government and for small business and it will significantly increase the percentage of the resources in the economy being used in the administration of the tax system both in the public and the private sectors. We still have to see the full analysis of the consequences of the $3.9 billion hole that the Treasurer, Mr Willis, has put through this package on the expenditure and revenue sides. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In winding up this debate, I particularly thank Opposition speakers who have supported the motion. Even the contributions of Labor senators were interesting, in that there seemed to be a universal acceptance that Labor should end its leadership farce. There seemed to be a reasonable acceptance on the other side of the chamber that Australia is not being properly governed during this period, in which all the Labor Party's energies and concentration have been upon its internal leadership conflict rather than its responsibilities, particularly the enormous number of unemployed in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some acceptance that the problems the country now has were, at least in part, as a result of poor government policy. There now seems to be almost a recognition of the importance on the part of the Government that it should debate the Opposition's alternative Fightback program and the detailed prescription that we have put down for a lift in incentive and, particularly, the creation of some two million jobs. If that is so, we are pleased to hear it, because debate is what we want. The package is on the table; it is there to be debated. An enormous amount of work has gone into it to produce a different direction for Australia, an alternative direction, which can produce jobs and give people better hope for the future than they are getting from Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that indicates a difference in attitude from what we have experienced in recent times, that is pleasing, because Mr Hawke, rather than being prepared to debate it, called for our program in order that he might blow it out of the water. When he failed to do that, the Keating sycophants called for the return of Mr Keating because he would be more effective in blowing it out of the water. The Opposition was not against the coalition at all; rather, it was a macho contest between the factions as to whose spokesman would be more effective in attacking the Opposition. That is not what the Australian people want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even Labor Party members do not see Mr Keating as offering anything more. They certainly do not claim his economic credentials as a reason for his leadership and they do not claim that he offers vision. They hardly could. They claim that he would be the most effective attack weapon against the Opposition. That is regrettable. Therefore, I hope that today's debate indicates a change of attitude and that they really do want to debate ideas and enter the battle of ideas for a change rather than simply trying to retain power through personal abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people are sick of that.

We welcome that debate and we are confident and sure that at the end of that debate the Australian people will see that the package offers them so much more than this Government has offered in the past and, in particular, what it can provide in a new direction is jobs, jobs and jobs.

In my absence from the Senate on 12 December, during Question Time Senator Collins answered a question from Senator Faulkner with regard to electricity charges in north Australia and related it to the Opposition's proposal for a goods and services tax. Senator Collins said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I have to say that Senator Tambling, on a radio debate with me this morning in the Northern Territory, had to concede it&mdash;that territorians will be paying somewhere between $70 and $100 a year more in Federal taxation on their domestic electricity accounts.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray interjected:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Tambling said this?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins then went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Tambling conceded this morning on ABC Radio that territorians will have to pay between $70 and $100 a year more in Federal taxes on the same amount of electricity that is used by consumers in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>I contend that the statement by Senator Collins is patently incorrect. I will read from a transcript of the ABC radio program of 12 December. I have Senator Collins's endorsement to table the document later. In that interview I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I think the most important thing to address in this, Clare, is we're talking about a total package and certainly the electricity is a component of it. But very importantly, the most important thing about why people can't pay their electricity bills is either they haven't got enough cash in their pockets, if they're an income earner, or they haven't got a job.</PARA>
<PARA>The reporter asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you don't deny that indeed they will go up quite substantially?</PARA>
<PARA>I responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be adjustments of course to all services. But at the same time there will be very substantial personal income tax cuts, zone allowance rebates, family allowances go up, there'll be 7 business taxes taken out and of course very significant savings to the household budget in the area of freight costs and transport.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in the same interview, the reporter asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you reject the figures that Senator Collins just provided?</PARA>
<PARA>I responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can get into a lot of detail on those very specifics, but when Senator Collins uses a figure like $70 on an electricity bill, what about the hundreds of dollars savings in an average petrol bill for the family, the thousands of dollars for tax savings and the tremendous advantages to business and to export industries that are going to create jobs and are going to put much more cash in every household's pocket? People that are on pensions are all going to be compensated very adequately for their overall cost of living.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe those quotations illustrate very dramatically that Senator Collins was incorrect in his contention in answer to the question.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While a number of elements of the policy change underlying the "High Road" Scenario are similar to those embodied in the Coalition's social welfare policy package, the analysis does not purport to portray the outcomes which would be achieved by implementation of that package.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The report before the Senate today is the first report of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The report shows that the work of the Authority is commendable and essential. The work undertaken by the AMSA ranges from the provision of navigational aids, to coordination of maritime research and rescue, to provision of a planning and response capability appropriate to the threat to maritime pollution from shipping in the Australian region, and to provision of a vessel registration service. These services are obviously necessary and I commend the Authority for the provision of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it absolutely astonishing&mdash;this has been stated in this place before&mdash;that the Authority is located inland, here in Canberra, hundreds of kilometres from the nearest drop of salt water. Surely, it would make more sense for the Authority to be located in a port city, a city such as Newcastle. How can this Authority properly and efficiently carry out its defined duties from a location in the Australian Capital Territory? This amazing situation has arisen due to the incompetence of the Labor Government, which has allowed the bureaucracy to run out of control and become self-serving, rather than serving the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Authority was originally to be based in Newcastle. Newcastle is a major port city and, by being based in that city, the Authority would have had greater communication access to the industry that it proposes to serve. In fact, the proposal made so much sense that Labor's own Minister for Land Transport, Mr Brown, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the decision to locate AMSA in Newcastle was based on objective reasons. Newcastle was the best location . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Given that this was the situation, it is truly bewildering that the decision was reversed in one of the worst cases of a snow job by the Public Service over the Government that has occurred in recent years. The decision was reversed by a new and inexperienced Minister, who was hoodwinked by the people in his Department by a fudged cost blow-out&mdash;including a four-day visit to Newcastle by 211 staff and their families to ascertain whether they wanted to move to Newcastle&mdash;which convinced the Minister to leave the Authority in Canberra, a long way from any maritime links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This left public servants happy in Canberra, wrapped in red tape without the perspective that would have been obtained by the Authority had it been located on the coast near the ports where communication and liaison with maritime sectors would have been more productive. This walkover of the Government by the public servants reads like something from an episode of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Prime Minister</EMPHASIS>. In an episode with remarkable parallels, Jim Hacker, PM, tries to relocate some of the armed forces to the north of England. It was made perfectly clear to the Prime Minister, however, that one simply could not ask senior officers to live permanently in the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and the public servants have forgotten the Australian people and the needs of Australian industry because they are not out there where the activity in our society is occurring. The sorry result of this attitude by the Hawke Government is that areas of the country are denied the economic stimulus that is so desperately needed. This occurs while the bureaucracy in Canberra just keeps expanding with no real benefit to the nation's economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Newcastle's economy needed the extra impetus that the Authority would have brought, especially when it was the ideal location for the AMSA. However, the city was ignored yet again by the Hawke Labor Government in the tradition of the submarine, frigate and mine hunter contracts that were refused to Newcastle. This Authority, AMSA, is to be commended for the work it carries out. It provides essential and vital services that are of benefit to Australia. The sad thing is to think of just how much more could have been achieved had the Authority been located in a position where it was best suited:  on the coast near the ports where the action of maritime industry is&mdash;at Newcastle, as was originally planned. </PARA>

We have heard Senator Collins many times in this chamber relaying to us the new technology being used by the Authority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to comment on this report today because it does have some relevance to my own State of Tasmania where, I suspect, we have an above average number of accidents and maritime problems. There has been a high loss of life in events such as the Sydney to Hobart yacht race, for instance. Many fishing boats have been lost because of the violent weather from time to time on the west coast of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make some comments on that particular area today. I was going to ask a question of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) but, unfortunately, it seemed impossible to do so today and I doubt very much whether I will get an opportunity to raise this matter tomorrow. However, there is a lot of concern in Tasmania, particularly about the proposal to abandon the high frequency receivers that are placed on Bruny Island and which relay signals to Melbourne radio. They will cease operation at the end of January 1992. We are in a new generation of satellite communication, and Senator Collins has said many times how efficient the EPIRB detection system is; but I point out that the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A total of 308 detections were received during the reporting period. Of these 227 were of undetermined origin, 65 were non-distress and 16 were real distress. . . </PARA>
<PARA>So of 308 detections there were 16 real distress signals. I know that the EPIRB system has caused some problems in America. In fact, there are so many false alarms that the safety authorities do not actually act on the first call on the EPIRB system. Although we have all this new technology and the proposal to shut down some of the smaller HF systems in Tasmania, I believe this will lead to a diminished service which will jeopardise the safety of a lot of fishermen and private boat owners in Tasmania. I have been made aware of that by people who are involved in search and rescue operations in Tasmania. I know that the Tasmanian Minister for Primary Industry, the Hon. David Llewellyn, has had quite a few meetings with the Minister here and has voiced his concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has pointed out, as has been pointed out to me, that with the receptive capability of Melbourne radio at this time, and even with the new HF system, we will not be able to provide the service that should be provided in Tasmania. In fact, distress calls on channels 2 and 4 will be disbanded, and it will be impossible for a 24-hour service to pick up distress calls, particularly from the west coast. We know, as Senator Tate would know very well, that this is of concern in Tasmania. People are talking about going to higher frequencies, 6, 8 and 12, but at the moment it is often impossible for even the HF signal 6 to be received on the west coast. So, whilst the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has done a great job, I believe it should look again at what it is doing in Tasmania. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Honey Board on its annual report and on the work that it does in trying to maximise the returns to Australian honey producers from the export of honey by generating a greater demand for Australian honey both here and overseas. I note from the report that it has not been a good year for the production of honey in Australia, just as it has not been a very good year for any rural industry. Page 6 of the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a fall in production of honey of 1.7 per cent for the 12 months ended 30 June 1989, production fell a further 6.3 per cent in the 1989-90 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>This fall in production obviously has a significant impact on prices. The report also states that the decline in production was most significant in New South Wales and Queensland, whereas other States such as Victoria recorded an increase in production on the previous year. Total recorded production of honey for the 12 months ended 30 June 1990 was 21,198 tonnes. This figure is based on all returns received by the Australian Bureau of Statistics irrespective of the number of hives kept. Owing to the diversified origins of honey, actual commercial production is estimated to exceed that figure by up to 5,000 tonnes. Consequently, the Board's estimate of production for 1989-90 is approximately 26,000 tonnes. Exports of honey for the year under review totalled 11,328 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The domestic scene in the honey industry is becoming quite exciting. The range of honeys on the Australian market is staggering. Created exclusively from a combination of bees, flowers and sunshine, honey is one of the few truly natural foods remaining. Australia's long hours of sunshine and its great selection of native trees and ground flora have given us a marvellous selection of unique floral honey varieties. However, because the beekeeping industry is relatively small in size and number, it is often ignored by the Government. It is not a large industry and it does not have a lot of money. We therefore have to be ever vigilant in keeping an eye on the industry, to ensure that the beekeepers stay in business and look after the agricultural crops for which we need them so desperately. At home we grow kiwi fruit, and if we do not get hives of bees from the honey producers in our district and put them in amongst the kiwi fruit vines, we can be quite sure that we will not get any kiwi fruit at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A healthy beekeeping industry is absolutely essential, but it is very much tied to circumstances out of its control. It is vital, therefore, under the adverse conditions that rural Australia is now experiencing that we do all we can to maintain the strength of the industry by watching the effect of economic factors and of the importation not only of honey produce but also of diseases. I note that during the previous year the Board expressed its concern about imports of honey from countries where the chalk brood disease is endemic. This disease is of some concern to beekeepers and it is regarded as a serious exotic disease by the Australian beekeeping industry. However, the Government has continued to stonewall, claiming that internationally chalk brood is not regarded as a major infectious disease of honey bees. Of course it is not, and the Government knows it is not. However, nearly every other country in the world has the disease. Australia does not have it, though, and our beekeepers do not want it. It is a quite nasty disease and it affects the effectiveness and profitability of beekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see, as detailed on page 3 of the report, that this year the Government finally came to acknowledge what a number of my colleagues and those in the beekeeping industry have been telling it. Imports of honey from countries affected by chalk brood are now subject to effective treatment protocols. This includes imports from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, there has been a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of all those associated with the Australian rural sector. It does not matter whether we produce the goods, factors outside the farm, such as disastrous government decisions on rural issues, in addition to its economic policies, mean that being on the land is just not profitable. In order to lower the difference in costs between Australia and its competitors we should look at the imposts placed on the small rural business and farming families by bureaucracy, big business and pure economic theory. Australia has a golden opportunity to become the world's greatest agricultural exporter with its pollution free food. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This is the second full year in which the current Soil Conservation Advisory Committee has operated. It refers to the fact that it has been a very busy year. Obviously, if we are to be successful in looking after our soils, future years will become even busier for the Committee. I want to make special mention of some of the members of the Committee. Mr Bob Junor has been the Commissioner of the Soil Conservation Service in my home State of New South Wales. I believe that he has been an outstanding Commissioner for the New South Wales Soil Conservation Service, which now comes under the Conservation and Land Management&mdash;CALM&mdash;Department. Mr Michael Tooth, a former President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, is also on the Committee. He lives in New England, and he has done an excellent job on this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report tells us that in my home State of New South Wales the growth of Landcare has been most impressive. In fact, New South Wales has had the most rapid increase of any State in the number of groups involved in Landcare. All the farming communities of New South Wales can take their hats off. I am very proud that they have led the way in land care. Looking after our soils is most important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other points brought out in the report was the concern expressed within the farming communities that increases in the national soil conservation program budget allocation were being used to fund an expanded bureaucracy rather than significantly increasing on the ground soil conservation activity. That matter is something I have raised in this chamber at other times. If we are going to have bodies looking after the soil, or any other part of our environment, the money has to be spent at the coalface&mdash;that is, right at the ground where it counts&mdash;and not in expanding the bureaucracy, which eats away at the money allocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also mentioned the rural downturn, which Senator Bjelke-Petersen also alluded to in her remarks. The report mentions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The way in which the landcare movement responds to low wheat and wool prices in a period of high interest rates and rising input costs. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It says that low wheat and wool prices in a period of high interest rates and rising input costs were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the basic ingredients of the current rural downturn.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is what we have all been talking about in this place. We have been trying to make the Government understand that it is those high interest rates and the rising input costs which have caused such great problems to the rural community. However, on top of that, we have also had the drought this year, which has had a big impact for the future of looking after our soil. Drought puts greater pressure on those on the land because it causes financial problems as well as affecting the soil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report mentions that the number of Landcare groups in Australia continues to grow at a faster pace than the capacity of State government land conservation agencies to fully service their needs. This is an area that has to be looked at in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, in New South Wales we have 12 State Landcare group support officers, 70 officers in technical project support for State soil conservation activities, 12 officers in Landcare groups and 19 officers in education and training positions and administrative positions. That makes a total of 113 officers for New South Wales out of a total of 407 around Australia. Obviously, the growth of Landcare groups has increased at a greater rate in New South Wales than in any other State. I feel proud of the way the challenge has been taken up to look after land, a precious resource; this chamber should feel proud of the people of New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin my remarks about the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee 1990-91 annual report by congratulating Gary and Jan English, from the Esperance district in Western Australia, who won the primary producer category of the awards in the Landcare program. They come from the soil conservation district in which I farm. They are very worthy of the award because they have set an example in practical management and control not only in Western Australia but in Australia as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other group I would like to congratulate for its practical work is the Jerramungup land conservation district committee, which I understand was the third land conservation district committee established in Australia. I would particularly like to congratulate its president, Rex Edmondson, who has been one of the driving forces behind the soil conservation program for Australia in general and Western Australia in particular. That district happens to be alongside the Esperance district. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Depending on where one comes from, I know there are claims and counter-claims about the soil conservation program, but it was in my State of Australia that the first real effort was made in soil conservation. This related particularly to the impact of wind erosion, which is a problem in much of Western Australia. It is worth noting that in WA there are now 142 land conservation districts and 70 catchment groups; the pastoral areas have also been covered. Practically the whole State is now covered by soil conservation and land management groups. The number of groups has increased from 109 last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised before in this chamber what I see as duplication between the national soil conservation program and the Landcare Australia Ltd program. Unfortunately, I did not get to speak on the annual report of Landcare Australia Ltd when it was tabled the other day, but I do question, as Senator Brownhill did in his speech, the necessity of having these two groups operating side by side. During the Estimates committee hearings I heard the reasons given for this duplication&mdash;one group being involved more in commercial activities than the other one&mdash;but it seems to me that, having two programs, both with bureaucracies behind them, there should be some way of combining the operations of the two groups. It is also worth noting that the Landcare report generally seems to be about 12 months behind in its summary of events, but unfortunately I do not have the time to go into that in any detail today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia this year, assistance was given to some 80 projects in the land care program. One important aspect, which I raised last year, is that we now have a Decade of Landcare coordinator which has been jointly funded by the national soil conservation program and the State Government. I congratulate them both for putting those funds together, because it means that there can now be overall coordination of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise another point in the time remaining. I refer to the current proposals in Western Australia to change the role of the division of resource management and have it incorporated under the auspices of some of the operations of the Department of Agriculture in Western Australia. The existing situation is that while the division of resource management is within the auspices of the Department of Agriculture it is in fact independent within it. As such, the division has a much narrower focus, which has largely been brought about by Graham Robinson, who is the Commissioner for Soil Conservation. I congratulate him on the way he has put the whole operation together since 1982 and focused the attention of pastoralists and farmers in Western Australia on the importance of protecting our most important resource&mdash;the soil. </PARA>

Separate records in respect of Commonwealth superannuation scheme contributions could not be maintained leading to breaches of the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament thanks the Auditor-General for drawing those matters to its attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite late in the report, on page 37, the Auditor-General points out a matter which is of real significance to this chamber, that is, the extent to which the Commonwealth guarantees the borrowings of government instrumentalities. We have had a disagreement in this place with the Government over whether government instrumentalities which do not receive an appropriation can properly be questioned in Senate Estimates committees. Government Ministers have claimed that unless an appropriation is made, there is no basis on which those organisations can be queried in Senate Estimates about their expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is demonstrated to be self-evident nonsense in this Auditor-General's report. He points out, for example, that there were borrowings by the Australian Industry Development Corporation at 30 June 1991 which were subject to a Commonwealth guarantee totalling $2.8 billion&mdash;that is, $2,780m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a guarantee by the Commonwealth. To suggest that this Parliament does not have the right to cross-examine people from government instrumentalities where such guarantees exist, simply because there is no Commonwealth appropriation, is a clear distortion of reality and a clear breach, in my view, of the requirements of this Parliament. Those sorts of enormous guarantees&mdash;as I said, almost $2.8 billion&mdash;clearly merit the existence of a capacity by the Parliament to cross-examine government instrumentalities. With respect to Austrade, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth guarantees the due payment by AUSTRADE of money that is, or may at any time become, payable by AUSTRADE to any person other than the Commonwealth. The contingent liability under contracts of insurance, guarantees and loans, including contracts on the Australian Government's account, totalled $5,787 million.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the Auditor-General has, in that little exercise, demonstrated the proprietary of our claims that all government instrumentalities, particularly those where there are guarantees in place relating to borrowings which are guaranteed by government, should be properly available for thorough examination in Senate Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by once again thanking the Auditor-General for his outstanding contribution to the workings of this Parliament over the year and for his assistance in ensuring that there is adequate scrutiny of the financial accounts of this Government and its instrumentalities. We on the Opposition side resist with great vigour any attempts to diminish the Auditor-General's right to audit the books of government instrumentalities. I hope that the Government will deal with this matter effectively in its roads legislation, which is soon to come before the House. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper I have just tabled has been prepared by a consultant to the Committee, Dr Stephen Parker. Dr Parker is a Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Law of the Australian National University and practised as a solicitor in the United Kingdom before moving to Australia. For three years he has taught a course which examines the nature of legal practice in Australia and the ethical rules which govern it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since June 1991, Dr Parker has been a Visiting Fellow at the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, Wolfson College, Oxford. He is thus admirably qualified to write this paper, not only because of his academic qualifications, but also because his stay at Oxford has allowed him ready access to the source material necessary for its preparation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee thanks Dr Parker for his work, and notes that a further paper which he has prepared for the Committee, entitled `Legal Ethics', will be tabled in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that it is important for it to examine the recent developments that have occurred in the United Kingdom concerning the regulation of the legal profession. Dr Parker's paper outlines the changes that have taken place in the United Kingdom in the last fifteen years which have culminated in the passage of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, as well as the further changes that are yet to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to emphasise that by examining these recent changes in the United Kingdom the Committee is in no way foreshadowing the recommendations that it will make in its final report. The Committee simply considers that it should inform itself not only of Australian developments in the provision of legal resources, but also of methods being used overseas to attempt to ensure that justice is accessible to all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would welcome submissions concerning, for example, whether or not it would be appropriate, or feasible, for aspects of the new regulatory framework for legal services in the United Kingdom to be implemented in Australia. It appreciates that there are significant differences between the legal systems of the two countries, but hopes that the release of this background paper will further the current debate concerning the cost of legal services and litigation in Australia today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the third time I will speak on the second reading of this package of Bills&mdash;and I anticipate that this speech will be briefer than the last two. I had reached the stage when speaking before of talking about the effect of the fringe benefits tax on rural Australia. I was pointing out that the effects were quite severe and were not appreciated. Many rural enterprises in Australia today simply cannot bear the added impost of a fringe benefits tax on staff who work on a property. Quite simply, that means that employment opportunities for people in the country are reduced. Also, there is a diminution, to some degree, in the productivity of the property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my lifetime there have been very great changes with respect to rural enterprises in Australia. Once upon a time&mdash;say, 30 years ago&mdash;there would be quite a community around the homestead of an average sized cattle or sheep property. There would have been the owner and his family; at least two married couples doing work around the place, living in accommodation on the property; and perhaps two or three station hands. It was quite a community. That situation has been run down very severely, principally through the application of union rules, rates of pay, overtime and all of the things which were never taken much notice of in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before someone on the other side of the Senate jumps to his feet to talk about the exploitation of the human race, having been involved in this sort of life over quite a long time I have no hesitation in saying that there are a number of people in the Australian community who like to live on a property and in a rural environment. They find it both very satisfying and very rewarding to work as members of a group of people running a property. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Brownhill" NAMEID="RD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Brownhill has said, they worked together. I suppose the Labor Party would say that it was a patriarchal or a patronising system. I do not think it was. I think people sweated together to achieve a common goal. In some cases a degree of exploitation was exerted but they were very much in the minority; they were very minor events. Basically, these communities operated quite happily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that some of the accommodation on the properties was not five-star&mdash;but neither was the main homestead. Most of those places were pretty spartan 20 or 30 years ago. The difference in accommodation between the main homestead and the quarters, or the houses on the property, was only minor. But that has all changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of the fringe benefits tax had a marked effect on the number of people employed on properties, reduced though it might have been. It meant that everything that the property owner provided became liable to be taxed. This included the accommodation which was provided and a number of other things which were shared, such as the telephone, electricity and portable gas for heating or cooking. It was always normal practice to share a beast killed on a property with whoever was living on the property. That now attracts fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of this tax is really quite pointless. It has led to a loss of employment opportunities in country areas of Australia and that has not helped our rural industries at all. As I said earlier, the rural industries were the second largest export earning bloc in this country. To get ourselves out of the huge debt that the Labor Party has left us, we will certainly have to maximise our export capabilities. During Question Time today the failed Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) gave a fatuous answer when he spoke about how he was changing Australia into an export economy. I can tell the Senate that he is not doing much for the rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish briefly to touch on two points. First, inserted into this Fringe Benefits Tax Act is a series of provisions requiring FBT to be paid on the cash component of the living away from home allowance where it is applied to offshore oil and gas workers. This bad precedent was challenged in the Attwood Oceanic case and the judge threw it out. The Treasury has now amended the Act to make the cash component of the living away from home allowances subject to FBT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition fears that this provision will not be quarantined and restricted to that point. We do not even agree with its being put on at that point. We do not think that that satisfies the reasons for which a living away from home allowance was awarded in the first place. There is the risk that it will spread through other areas of employment in Australia where a living away from home allowance is paid. Of course, there are a very large number of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own State of Queensland, some of the shires have been hit and have been protesting when they have to pay camp allowances for their shire workers. In rural shires it is not uncommon to pay a camp allowance to people who live on the job when they are building a road or a bridge somewhere remote from the centre of the shire where they have their principal place of residence. To now impose on the shires, semi-governmental authorities as they are, the requirement to pay fringe benefits tax is simply increasing the costs of operation in the community. At the end of the day that cost filters through to the ordinary taxpayer, who has to pay for this nonsense. I find it absurd that government enterprises should pay fringe benefits tax, but then I also find the whole concept of the fringe benefits tax absurd and quite unjust, as I have said on every occasion that I have spoken on it, starting from 29 May 1986 when the legislation was introduced into the Senate. My final duty, at the request of Senator Short, is to move an amendment to Senator Short's amendment to the second reading motion on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague asks a very good question. I would like to be a fly on the wall tonight to see who is there and who is not there. I have no doubt that it will be a very interesting event. However, this matter is much more serious than that. This Government has engendered unprecedented confusion over its economic policy stance and the state of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week the new Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Government representatives here, notably Senator Evans as Acting Leader of the Government, were telling us that signs of economic recovery were under way and there was no need to change course in the Government's policy direction. Three or four days later, just two days ago, the Treasurer held a press conference, which was ostensibly another opportunity to attack the Opposition's Fightback proposals&mdash;the Treasurer's second attack in a week&mdash;at which he laid nary a feather, let alone a glove, on the Opposition's proposals in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. Indeed, I wonder whether the Government is ever going to get into the ring on this Fightback proposal attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only two days ago that the Treasurer said that the Government's Budget forecasts may not be met to a certain important degree, and that there is to be a major review of the Budget forecasts and Budget parameters. The Treasurer appeared to signal that there could be a change in direction of Government economic policy in the new year. There is unprecedented confusion which is causing enormous destabilisation in the financial markets, in the investment world and in the productive sectors of the economy, particularly in manufacturing and the service industries where investment decisions will have to be made very shortly if we are going even to start to climb out of the deepest recession&mdash;the Government imposed recession&mdash;that we have had for 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had three Treasurers in the past seven months. The way things are going, it is very likely that we will have a fourth Treasurer within the next few days or weeks. All this comes at a time when we have seen the greatest of deterioration in a Commonwealth government's budgetary position, and where, in the past two years alone, we have seen an unravelling and a deterioration in the Budget situation of no less than $13 billion, even on published figures. When appropriate adjustments are made to those figures so that one is comparing like with like, the deterioration is more likely to be $16 billion to $17 billion. It is no wonder that the financial markets have been unsettled. It is no wonder that we have seen a series of records chalked up by this Hawke Government. Some of those records are worth putting on the Senate record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now had the highest level of unemployment since the Depression. If we add to the number of officially unemployed people those who are unable to find the volume of work that they would like&mdash;those who are not shown as unemployed because they are working for one or two hours a week, the underemployed&mdash;we have a situation in Australia today where about 15 per cent of the work force is unemployed or underemployed. Even on the recorded statistics, one out of every three young persons in this country is unable to find a job. So that is one record of the Hawke Government that is indelibly imprinted on the minds of every Australian and every Australian family. We have seen a record loss of jobs in any 12-month period since the Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of years we have seen record real interest rates, surpassing anything we have seen in our history. There has been a record low in corporate sector net profitability since the collection of these figures commenced more than a quarter of a century ago. I interpose to say that yesterday, in an extraordinary comment, the Treasurer said that the current relatively high level of corporate profitability was going into rebuilding balance sheets rather than investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the Treasurer has not even read his own Government's Budget Papers for 1991. If he had read page 2.24 in Budget Paper No. 1, he would have seen a graph showing that gross operating surplus&mdash;at least that is a term that the current Treasurer understands; the previous Treasurer did not even know what it meant&mdash;net of tax and interest payments is the lowest that it has been since collection of that data commenced. Indeed, it has declined progressively in every year that this Government has been in office, with the exception of the first year. So much for the Treasurer's quite spurious statement yesterday about corporate profitability!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this Government, we have seen a record number of quarters of falling investment and negative economic growth since the Depression of the 1930s. The Prime Minister has today created a new record, namely, a record low in his approval rating as measured in the Morgan poll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we had an indication of another policy rethink earlier this week during what was meant to be a press conference by the new Treasurer on the Fightback proposals of the coalition. If that goes ahead, we could be facing our fourth review of the Australian economy in less than 12 months. A so-called major review culminated in the industry statement of March 1991; three months later we had the Budget; and three months after that in November we had the so-called employment statement by the Prime Minister. With the exception of the Budget, each of the four statements&mdash;there are potentially four&mdash;have been totally politically motivated. In each instance the motivation has been the need to shore up the Prime Minister's leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The March 1991 industry statement was all set to be a statement on industry policy. It was going to be made by the appropriate Minister&mdash;namely, Senator Button&mdash;but the Prime Minister got a fright and gained advice that his leadership was slipping. So he grabbed the ball, ran with that industry statement and turned it into more than an industry statement. It turned out to be a completely inadequate and totally politically motivated statement as to the state of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mickey mouse employment statement of November 1991, last month, was delivered again only because the Prime Minister's supporters told him he had to do something to thwart Mr Keating's destabilisation campaign against his, the Prime Minister's, leadership. That statement went down like a lead balloon. As a result, the confusion generated in the economy by the Government's approach to economic policy making simply compounded what was already a very confused situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now seem to be facing another thwarted Keating thrust, but I believe that this one is more serious and dangerous. That is why I wanted to speak on it briefly today. It looks as though this next policy rethink will be a policy U-turn that will out-Keating Keating. As we all know, Mr Keating has been wooing the Left very hard in a desperate attempt to win Caucus votes on the leadership. The Left want a much more expansionist and interventionist policy thrust by the Government&mdash;the old fashioned pump priming approach so beloved by generations of socialists and so-called social Democrats that has been rejected by virtually every other developed nation in the world. I had thought and hoped that it was an approach that had been largely rejected by even the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the current political machinations involving the job not of the million and a half people who are unemployed and underemployed in Australia but of one person&mdash;the Prime Minister&mdash;it appears that we will run the risk of seeing a major and very damaging and dangerous U-turn in economic policy. It is dangerous for a variety of reasons. At the moment, the combined Commonwealth and State governments throughout Australia are in a total deficit position this year of something like $12 billion. They are drawing on national savings to the tune of about $12 billion net. Of that, the Commonwealth's contribution accounts for a little more than 50 per cent. So at a time when governments should be contributing to national savings they are drawing on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is to have in its policy rethink an interventionist and, more importantly, an expansionist economic policy which will add to the already very large public sector deficit this financial year, that can have only one consequence, which is, as I say, drawing on the national savings and competing for funds with the private sector and, therefore, forcing up interest rates. If the increased deficit is financed by government borrowings, that would be the impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other things could happen. One is that the Government could meet the increased expenditure of a pump priming nature by increased taxation. That is what State governments have been doing around the nation by and large this year in an attempt to shore up their deteriorating economic budgetary positions. So we face the prospect of increased taxation if we were to have a policy review leading to an expansionist, pump priming approach early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative and third option is to do what wrecked this country back in the 1970s under the Whitlam Government, which is to turn to the printing presses and have more money printed via the Reserve Bank. A reversion to the printing presses, as the Whitlam Government did, would re-create the structural damage done to this economy in those days, from which I believe we have never fully recovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very serious issue is at hand in the statements by Treasurer Willis in recent days that the Government may well be doing a policy rethink. I was very alarmed today to hear Senator Button say, in response to my question about whether any changes would be funded if there were a mini-Budget next year, that he was not prepared to give that guarantee in any shape or form. That is a very dangerous portent for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one way to get this country out of the dreadful mess we are in. We will not solve it by going back to the old days of socialist pump priming; we will do it by picking the country up, giving it a shake and saying to all that we have to tackle the whole matter in a different way. We have to make ourselves more productive, competitive and lean. We have to have more independence and reliance on ourselves as individuals, firms and families and rely less on the welfare mentality that has been built up in our country over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the coalition's Fightback proposals are all about and why they are so fundamentally important to everything that happens in this country over the next decade. If the approach outlined in the coalition's Fightback proposals is not adopted, we will face more intractable problems which will become increasingly much more difficult to tackle. The matter is vitally urgent. If we were now to see a government stepping back even further from its current position, the problems would be tremendous. I hope very much that that will not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not mind the Government picking up some of the Fightback proposals and running with them. It has adopted two proposals already: the abolition of the coal export levy that we have put forward and some measures in relation to isolated children. They are both very good measures. We applaud the Government's decision to follow us. I hope that it will follow us further down that route, because if it does not, as I said, the problems will be compounded. Christmas should be a time of joy, happiness and beneficial reward to people. To have the amount of human misery that is facing this nation and every person and family at this time of the festive season is, in my view, an absolute disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Senate condemns the Government for its economic policy failures which have resulted in one and a half million Australians being unemployed or underemployed in the worst recession for 60 years, and urges the Government to adopt the Opposition's `Fightback!' package of proposals to provide hope, and a vision for the future, for all Australians. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then includes a number of particular points. Adoption of these points is urged very sincerely and strongly by Opposition members as the only way forward&mdash;not only in tax reform matters but also as a way of getting this economy onto its feet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no hope left now for the Labor Government and there may be less than 24 hours left for this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who has entertained the honourable senators opposite at Christmas dinner&mdash;which all day around this chamber has been called the `last supper'&mdash;at the Lodge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speculate as to what will happen in the next 24 hours. I just make the serious point that, while the Government members were having their last supper&mdash;their Christmas pudding&mdash;at Prime Minister Hawke's Lodge this evening, one million Australians were unemployed and the whole of Australia was crying out for some kind of Christmas present in terms of an economic approach that will work in this country; and that can be found only in the Opposition's proposals, about which not one criticism has struck home in the four weeks since they were announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I see Government members in despair because they know that there has not been a feather placed on the decisions that have been announced, including, as is referred to in the amendment that is before us, the largest personal income tax cuts in Australia's history, which amount to $13 billion. That is not being offered by the Australian Government, by the Labor Government; it is what is being offered by the Liberal and National parties' Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will only be when we are elected to government that we will see a turnaround and the creation of two million extra jobs in the remaining years of this decade, the largest ever income tax cuts, the complete abolition of excise on petrol, diesel and other fuels, the abolition of all wholesale sales tax, the abolition of all payroll taxes, the abolition of the superannuation lump sum tax, the abolition of all Customs duties, the abolition of the training guarantee levy and the coal export duty and so on. These are the matters that are referred to in the amendment because it is the only good news that can be offered in the Senate chamber when we are debating this aspect of the economy, that is, the tax measures that the Government has placed before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to turn now to one particular Bill, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2). I make the observation that Bills for double taxation agreements between Australia and other countries often do not receive much attention when they come before the Parliament, I think because they are regarded as highly technical&mdash;and they are&mdash;and because they are matters of such careful negotiation between Australia and other countries that it is only if some major principle is being transgressed that we seek, in the Parliament, some amendment or some change. I wish to refer to the two agreements that are before us in this legislation, one with Poland and the other with India. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make the obvious point, such tax agreements are indeed a positive measure when they are worked out to serve the national interests of Australians. They give a greater incentive for Australians to engage in commerce from Australia into these other countries, yet double penalties will not be suffered in paying tax in this country and in the other country. It is to this aspect I wish to refer in addressing the Bills before us this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has developed a system of such agreements with quite a number of countries, and the Bill now before us extends that system to include Poland and India. So I welcome the Bill, and I hope that these agreements will assist the blossoming of trade and investment between Australia and Poland and between Australia and India. There is certainly plenty of scope to increase our economic links with both these countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989-90, for example, our exports to Poland totalled $109.3m while our imports from Poland were worth $38.7m. That is a total trade of only $150m, or a bit less, between our countries, which is not very much at all. There is certainly a great deal of room for improvement. Indeed, many Polish Australians, or many Australians of Polish descent&mdash;and many others besides&mdash;are urging Australians to become a part of the investment pattern that will lead to something of an economic rescue through overseas investment in Poland; that is what is argued is needed in that country. Certainly it is my view that we can increase the commercial relations between Australia and Poland to the mutual benefit of the Polish people and the Australian people; we must take all measures so that we can do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, our trade with India is on a much larger scale but it is still well below the potential that I believe is achievable. Senator Maguire is here tonight in the chamber. In 1989 he and I were both involved in a major Senate inquiry into Australia's relations with India, including our trade relations. We brought before the Senate a series of recommendations that would see an increase in trade between India and Australia, and that report was very positively responded to by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present level of Australian exports to India is little more than the 1989-90 figure of $589.9m, and our imports from India in that year were worth $278.4m. That is less than $1 billion worth of trade with India. In fact, against a background of trade around the world, 51 per cent of Australia's exports&mdash;that is, just over half of all our exports&mdash;is to the Asia-Pacific nations, east Asia and the ASEAN area, and only one per cent of our trade is with south Asia. That trade of a little less than $1 billion&mdash;the figure I have just rehearsed&mdash;is mostly with India. It is my view that the majority of our trade in the decades ahead will continue to be with east Asia and the ASEAN area, but we still can increase substantially our trade with India and south Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having outlined or introduced my thoughts to that extent, given the enormous amount of material we are to consider in the Senate between now and our rising tomorrow, I seek leave to incorporate the balance of my speech on these matters in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me early in my remarks commend those who were responsible for preparing the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. It is very clear in setting out and explaining what the Bill does and what the various clauses of the two agreements mean. It is a memorandum in the newer style of "plain English" that is now sometimes forthcoming from the Government. I welcome it, and commend the public servants responsible for drafting it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than deal with the complexities of these two agreements, I want to reflect on the broader context of economic development in Poland and India and consider how Australia's economic interests can best be furthered in light of that development, a part of that process being, of course, the establishment of these double taxation agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of Poland, the economy is now dominated by the transition from communism to capitalism, with all the pressures and difficulties that that is bound to involve. We saw in 1989 the overturning of numerous communist regimes in eastern Europe, and in that process Poland played a significant role. It led eastern Europe in the holding of partially democratic elections and the bringing to power of a government led by non-Communists. It is worth reflecting on the nature of those changes, as we seek to understand better the relationships a country like Australia can now have with Poland and its neighbours. We have seen the ending of communist tyranny and the launching of political democracy and economic liberalisation. The old Marxist and Stalinist formulas failed the peoples of eastern Europe. Their rigidly planned economies failed to either furnish a satisfactory standard of living or provide a viable industrial base that was efficient and could trade competitively in an open world market. This economic failure of communism has meant that the people of those countries have suffered lower standards of living than needed to be the case. They have been denied opportunities to develop entrepreneurial flair and make economic decisions for themselves. Not only were each of these countries suffering from having a centrally-directed economy, they were nearly all subject to a significant level of pressure from the Soviet Union as to what they could and could not produce and as to how they should trade with the Soviet Union and other countries. Coupled with this economic oppression was political oppression, which was essential if the economic oppression was to be implemented. Basic liberal freedoms such as freedom of speech and freedom of association were denied to people much of the time, and there was no mechanism for the people to use to force a change of government. The lack of choice and competition between differing political views meant a denial of what we consider to be essential democratic rights. The oppression of people by these communist regimes was even wider than merely economic or political, in my view. There was a deeper malaise, a breakdown of civic trust, a breakdown of confidence in the governing institutions of a country. People could not be sure whether they could trust family or friends or neighbours, for these might be agents of secret police forces. There was little value placed on truth. Even the economic statistics produced by these regimes were sometimes suspect, which made economic decision making all the harder. In other words there was what I would term a spiritual malaise. It meant the denial by the regime of values of justice. Little wonder that in the end these regimes imploded. The people were no longer prepared to put up with the conditions in which they had to live their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The way in which communism fell varied from country to country. Poland, happily, was among those where the move was bloodless. The challenge since then for Poland has been to devise policies that can best manage the transition to a market economy. Bold moves were promptly taken, and a vigorous reform program began from 1 January 1990. For that boldness Poland is to be commended. I believe that when such massive changes need to be undertaken, with the undoubted pain that these will bring for the people of the country, it is better to tackle them quickly rather than gradually. The big shifts in Polish policy from the start of last year is therefore, in my view, the right approach. The move to more realistic pricing of goods and services meant changes to economic difficulties. Instead of many queues at Polish shops for goods that were in short supply, the shops before long became well-stocked with many goods, although these were often at higher prices which put them out of the reach of many consumers. Unemployment, not surprisingly, rose, but there was success in keeping the inflation rate down. This year has seen an agreement with the IMF and the cancellation of a significant portion of Poland's foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For much of the last two years the Government has kept up its thrust of economic reform, with a continuity of key economic ministers in the government both before and after President Walesa took office. There is at the moment some uncertainty about the future because of the result of the recent parliamentary elections and the large number of parties elected. There have been reports in recent weeks of a slowdown in the privatisation program. I hope that this will prove to be a short term hiatus, and that before long there will be a government formed which will press on with policies of economic reform. One step forward has been the opening of a Warsaw Stock Exchange last April. It is located in the former headquarters of the Communist Party, an irony that appeals to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are opportunities for Australian firms to become involved in ventures in Poland. This double taxation agreement will help to provide a framework of confidence that will encourage further investment. I note, as examples, some press reports in the last year or so of instances of Australian investment. The Financial Review of 29 August 1990 reported the success of Seafood Products Gdynia, a joint venture which is 51% owned by a Melbourne company and which has enjoyed success in the food processing market in Poland. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 8 July this year reported that an Australian firm has won the rights to operate duty free shops at the new Warsaw International Airport. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 12 August reported a joint venture of Telecom, a Perth firm and Polish investors to set up a telephone network in rural Poland. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 30 July this year noted that Western Mining Corporation was interested in the possibility of involvement in a large Polish Government-owned copper producer when it is privatised. So there are possibilities for Australian interests in Poland, and I hope that the passage of this double taxation agreement will help to encourage other Australian firms to consider Polish opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the agreement with India. Senators will not be surprised that I refer to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the subject of Australia-India Relations, a document that we presented to the Senate in 1990. It was a good report, and it dealt with the economic relationship as well as other aspects of the bilateral relationship. That relationship has not been as close in recent years as it could be, and that includes the economic aspect. India has had a history of caution and even suspicion about foreign investment. There has been a considerable effort in the past to aim at a high degree of industrial self-sufficiency. There has been a rigid system of industrial licensing and price control, along with a high level of government involvement and ownership in key industries. These have not been good circumstances in which to develop Australia's economic links with India. However, there has more recently been a change of approach in policy-making circles in India, just as has been happening in many parts of the world. There is now a desire on the part of the Indian Government to move to an economy with a less dominant public sector and an economy that is more open to international competitive forces. The first budget of the government of Mr Rao, introduced on 24 July, made clear moves towards economic liberalisation. Foreign investment is being made easier in many industries. The domestic deficit is being cut back. Australia can do more to take up opportunities in trade and investment in India, and at the same time India must be doing its part in making those opportunities. I believe that we are now more firmly set on that path of mutual economic benefit than for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems quite appropriate that this double taxation agreement was signed in the same week as the Rao Government's liberalising budget was brought down. This agreement will add to the framework of measures that will encourage Australians and Australian firms to become economically involved with India. The Senate Committee report in Chapter Two discusses export prospects in a number of fields, including coal, power and steel; wool; wheat; lead, zinc and alloys; and computers and associated technology. It gives instances of opportunities already being taken up by Australian firms. There are further opportunities opening up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me refer to a paper recently given by Paul Barratt, a Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, when he addressed the Melbourne South Asian Studies Group and the Melbourne Branch of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. He refers to a paper prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and says: "The paper argues that Australia should more systematically exploit market opportunities in India, especially in the minerals and energy, agriculture, services and development project sectors. These are the sectors where Australia already has substantial commercial links and expertise. . . India's chronic capital shortage and moves to promote foreign investment could lead, however, to further policy changes intended to open the mining sector to overseas private sector investors. Gold, diamonds and non-ferrous metals are the resources offering greatest potential reward to investors in this sector. The signing in July 1991 of a Double Tax Agreement between Australia and India should facilitate investment procedures as the opportunities become available. . . In the agriculture sector, Australian pulse exports provide a substantial share of India's price-sensitive import market for this commodity. . . Prospects for consultancy services are sound in mining, environmental management, agriculture, telecommunications and energy. . . Opportunities exist to win commercial contracts for large-scale development projects, particularly in mining. . . India's critical need for power generation should provide opportunities for Australian energy projects linking the supply of steaming coal to seaboard thermal power plants." I make this reference to Mr Barratt's paper as it is a current summary of the possibilities open to us with regard to India.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take particular note of Article 24 of the agreement with India. This provides for "tax sparing", a means of encouraging particular foreign investment where India under its own laws forgoes tax, and the Australian-resident recipient of income will obtain tax credit relief as if the Indian tax had been paid. This is a sound provision that ensures that the agreement does not over-ride particular Indian incentives for development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conclude on the note that I am optimistic about what can be achieved by Australia in both Poland and India. These agreements are a significant part of improving our opportunities in those countries, and so I welcome their passage through the Parliament.</PARA>

These initiatives have come out of the March statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the risk of being accused of repetition, we are now in December and the measures contained in the industry statement were announced on 12 March.

I admit that a lot of good could have been achieved if these measures announced in March had been put in place far earlier. However, I presume it is better late than never. A prediction was made on the radio this morning that another statement would be handed down in February. I always thought that might be the case. It may be that the initiatives in the March statement will not have been implemented by the time the next statement is handed down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991 is to amend fringe benefits tax law to ensure that living away from home allowances for people working on offshore oil and gas platforms are treated as fringe benefits tax. I have said many times in this place, and I will say many times again, that fringe benefits tax is mostly a restriction on enterprise, production and incentives, especially when it comes in the remoter areas&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. If Senator Tate looks at the Fightback package, he will see that it will be reviewed and altered where it is not a fringe benefit in remote areas. If Senator Tate reads the Fightback package, he will see that. The tax is restrictive and is an impost on production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting when it comes to the oil platforms, and I will come back to this later. How can it be said that accommodation supplied on an oil platform&mdash;a man-made platform&mdash;is a fringe benefit? The workers are in a captive situation. Where can they be accommodated except on the oil rig? If they are not accommodated on the oil rig, there will be no workers. If there are no workers on the oil platform, the oil rig will not produce. It is as simple as that; there is no alternative. At least mining and oil exploration companies in some of the more remote areas can employ local people, and they do not have to pay fringe benefits tax because they are not supplying accommodation, but on an oil platform they can do nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to zone A or zone B rebates, the Taxation Office specifically denies them to taxpayers who work on oil rigs. Taxpayers who spend far more than six months on platforms and apply for rebates are told that they are not in zone A or zone B because those zones finish at the shoreline. The rebates do not apply to man-made objects. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>They apply to offshore islands which are part of Australia's jurisdiction, but not to man-made platforms. At least three rulings that I know of have gone against taxpayers who have applied for rebates in those circumstances. Incidentally, I have a private member's Bill, which will be brought on later, prepared to remedy just that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workings of the living away from home allowance and fringe benefits tax are described in the explanatory memorandum as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">LAFHAs are defined in section 30 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986</EMPHASIS> (FBTAA) as being allowances paid to compensate an employee for additional expenses incurred by the employee or additional expenses incurred by the employee and other additional disadvantages that the employee is subject to while required to live away from his usual place of residence in order to perform his work duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some LAFHAs paid to offshore oil and gas rig workers are paid solely to compensate the employee for additional disadvantages of living away from home. Because these allowances do not include a component for additional expenses incurred by the employee they do not fall within the definition of a LAFHA in section 30 of the FBTAA.</PARA>
<PARA>This legislation makes sure that it will work in that way. I will now move on to the general mining, exploration and prospecting leases. Deductions will be allowed for expenses incurred in the maintenance and exploration of those areas. To date, there has been no allowance for the grassroots sort of exploration where there are large areas, but not necessarily mining leases. People can just fly over the areas using a magnetometer, or travel along the roads taking samples. There are no definite mining leases, and that will be fixed up in this legislation. On behalf of the mining industry I welcome the move. The legislation will allow deduction on mining tenements, and a mining tenement covers a prospecting lease and an exploration licence, only on a specified piece of ground or a general purpose lease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just coming to capital gains tax. There are certain provisions in the Fightback package, if Senator Maguire would care to read them, showing how we are going to deal with it. It certainly will not be the capital gains tax that this Government brought in, even though it said there would be no capital gains tax. We will allow costs such as interest, repairs, rates and taxes, insurance premiums and land taxes in calculating capital gains tax. One important point is that capital gains tax has been a boon to accountants. Nowhere in this legislation have accounting fees been mentioned as deductible. As I said, that has been a big boon to accounting firms which keep the records, especially when people in property are in for the long haul. Capital gains tax should not apply where some property is held for a very long time. There is provision in the Fightback package to even that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It only applies to assets bought after 21 August 1991. In other words, assets bought between 20 September 1985 and 21 August 1991 will always be taxed without having these deductions. I ask: why is this? It is totally unfair because anyone who bought after 20 September 1985 to the present date must be termed a long term investor. Short term investors would have been out in the first 12 months. I believe it is totally unfair. In the Hewson package we will allow certain measures. For instance, we will allow an option to pay capital gains tax at a flat rate, so a person will not have to keep the normal paperwork that is required in these cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to provisional tax. For 1991 and subsequent years, taxpayers will be liable to pay provisional tax on salary and wages if they satisfy both parts of a simple test. I think it would read better if people paid provisional tax when they failed a simple test. The two conditions are that the balance is to be paid by a salary or wage earner if the assessment is more than $3,000 and, secondly, if PAYE deductions from salary or wages income are under deducted by $3,000 or more. Why these changes? Obviously, it seems to me, the present system gives rise to an inequity where some members of a class of taxpayers, liable to provisional tax, will escape the liability simply because provisional tax was raised in the previous year. The second reading speech provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To resolve this inequity the Bill will split the provisional tax credits into two components:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)  provisional tax on income other than salary or wages; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)  provisional tax on salary and wages income.</PARA>
<PARA>What other angles is the Government going to use to make sure that more flows to the taxation department than should be the case, and then it is a person's good luck if he happens to get it back later on? The problem is this: if provisional tax is raised the year before, and there is a tax credit, why is that not made available without a person having to incur further tax and then, hopefully, to get it back, if the person fits into the situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on provisional tax, there has been nothing said in the explanatory memorandum on what the uplift is going to be. I thought the uplift was legislated for every year but I understand it is still at 10 per cent. How can we say that around Australia this year, in the worst recession in the last 60 years, there is going to be an average uplift in profits of 10 per cent? I know that I am going to be told later by the Minister or someone else that there is provision for readjustment, and I know that. But once people ask for a provisional readjustment they are wide open to penalties if they do not happen to do their accounting properly and get within plus or minus 10 per cent. They should have the right to pay provisional tax at the rate it was paid the previous year&mdash;presuming that it was last year. Then, if people find it is below that figure, it is up to them. For many years, there has been an uplift of 10 or 11 per cent. In the good years I suppose that was fair enough, but in this case I cannot see too many businesses around Australia having an average uplift of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the tardiness of this legislation. We dealt with the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) the other day.

At least within the jurisdiction that Australia has over its waters, they should be treated the same.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating a number of taxation Bills cognately. In the first section of my remarks I want to outline the proposals contained in those Bills and then I want to concentrate on some of the issues that the legislation addresses. The first Bill, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991, proposes to implement the Budget decision to increase the minimum income thresholds which apply to the Medicare levy. People with income below the various thresholds are exempt from the levy. It is annual practice to increase the thresholds and to announce the increases when delivering the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 1991-92 the threshold for individuals will remain unchanged at $11,745, while married couples and sole parents with income under $19,674 will be exempt. The threshold is increased by $2,100 for each dependent child or student. Thus a sole parent with three children will not pay any Medicare levy if her or his income is less than $25,974. The level of tax instalment deductions will not be adjusted because the administrative costs of adjustment are quite substantial. These costs include things such as the cost of printing and distribution of millions of pay-as-you-earn deduction forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are currently paying the levy but who will be under the threshold when this Bill passes will continue to pay the levy but this will be refunded at the end of the financial year. Provisional tax will also not be adjusted to reflect the minor changes in this Bill. Again, the cost and the complexity is too great to warrant such a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support this legislation. However, I think it could be improved by also increasing the $2,100 allowance for each dependent child or student in line with inflation to maintain the real value of this concession. Perhaps the Government might consider this in next year's Budget or in its economic statement in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next Bill in the package before us tonight is the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991. Fringe benefits tax applies to fringe benefits, as defined, which are provided to employees by employers. This tax is based on the New Zealand model, which imposes the liability on the employer and not on the recipient of the benefit. Obviously, it is argued that this is very efficient for collection purposes and ensures high levels of compliance. It is also politically astute, because the tax burden legally falls on the business sector, even though salary packages are reduced to take account of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fringe benefits tax is levied at the top personal marginal income tax rate of 47 per cent. This is because fringe benefits tax applies to benefits which would normally accrue to high income earners and, hence, would be taxed at this rate if the benefit were paid in cash. I believe that this is a sound principle. However, it ignores the fact that the Medicare levy is added to this 47 per cent rate, thereby making the actual maximum marginal rate 48.25 per cent. There is still a minor incentive to take benefits in the form of fringe benefits instead of cash. This Bill proposes to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax from 47 per cent to 48.25 to eliminate that small anomaly which I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure was originally proposed in the two alternative Budgets that the Democrats have so far released, so obviously it would be hypocritical of us not to support it. We costed this proposal in our alternative Budget as raising $25m per annum. Treasury has estimated that it will raise $35m per annum for the April to April full year. This measure will commence in April 1992. Despite the protestations we often hear, particularly from the Opposition, about Democrat proposals to raise revenue, I think that this measure is a good example of how the Australian Democrats are responsible by seeking to raise in an equitable manner the additional revenue we wish to spend. This Bill will add to the progressivity of the taxation system. That is a fair principle, and I think it is good to see the Opposition supporting this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next Bill in the package is the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991. This Bill is the formal imposition Bill, which is necessary under section 55 of the Constitution when a tax is imposed. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which I will be discussing later, contains a provision to impose an interest withholding tax on securities which do not pay interest. This proposal is not controversial; it is simply closing a loophole in the tax file number provisions. It was announced earlier this year in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan). This separate Bill is necessary for constitutional reasons. I will deal with the policy of the decision to impose this withholding tax on certain securities in my discussion on the third Bill. Of course, the Democrats support this Bill and will not oppose its second reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes to give the force of law to two double taxation agreements recently entered into by Australia. The agreements, which are with India and Poland, follow the ordinary structure of double taxation agreements, with some minor variations where this has been insisted upon by the other nation. For example, the Indian agreement has a special treatment of royalties which is different from that normally followed by Australia in its treaties; indeed, it is different from the royalties provision in the Polish agreement, which is also contained within this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indian Government has insisted upon a broad definition of royalties, which includes fees for the rendering of technical or consultancy services. In addition, the rate of the royalty withholding tax is to be set at 20 per cent for the first five years for private sector payers, dropping to 15 per cent, which is the rate that applies for government payers. I am not criticising the Government for breaking with tradition, because I am aware of the importance of this treaty in terms of building stronger trade ties between India and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also aware that the United States took years to negotiate a similar arrangement with India and that it is an achievement on the part of our negotiators to have succeeded in obtaining a similar outcome to that achieved by the United States. The Australian Democrats support the two double taxation agreements which are before the Senate tonight and will be supporting that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the variety of matters that I have already referred to, the major piece of legislation in the package is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). This Bill is the usual end of year massive omnibus income tax Bill. There are 26 categories of amendments covered by the Bill, none of which is controversial, although the Opposition will be moving some amendments. The measures proposed include taxing the living away from home allowance of offshore oil workers as a fringe benefit instead of as income. There will be an exemption from income tax for the pay and allowances paid to Defence Force personnel who served in the Iraq war. Investment related lottery winnings will be taxed. Petroleum rent resource tax is to be deductible for income tax purposes when it is paid, and not in the subsequent year. The 125 per cent deduction for research and development will be extended indefinitely beyond its sunset date of 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A register of cultural organisations, donations to which will be tax deductible, will be established. Expenditure on environmental impact statements will be tax deductible over the lesser of 10 years or the life of the project. Imputation credits will arise only when company tax is paid instead of when it is assessed. A new method of calculation of provisional tax is to be introduced to eliminate an anomaly in the existing system. New rules are to be introduced to impose withholding tax on deferred interest investments where the investor has not provided a tax file number. There will be an overhaul and a standardisation of objection and appeal provisions for all taxation matters. All registered organisations will be removed from the dividend imputation system and the existing franking credits which have been accumulated will be eliminated. There are amendments to delete redundant references in the provisions which deal with income earned in overseas employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the areas covered in this Bill are enormous. I will spend a few minutes dealing with some of the more contentious ones which concern the Democrats and some which concern the Opposition. The first matter relates to the Medicare levy exemption. The proposal to limit the Medicare levy exemption to those social security beneficiaries who are in receipt of a sickness benefit and the blind pension will affect some health care card holders who were receiving the sole parent pension and other pensions and benefits which have employment transition packages. The exemption would also have applied to some people who would have received a partial family allowance supplement. As I understand it, the Government is arguing that this is an unintended consequence of the drafting of the original proposal and that, therefore, the measure must be amended to reflect that earlier policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways it is quite difficult for us to support a measure which seeks to remove retrospectively an advantage to those obtaining assistance under our often unfair social security system. Over the years I think the Democrats have sat in this chamber voting alone while the Government and the Opposition have combined to erode the rights of those in this community who are the most vulnerable and most in need. It is quite a nice irony that for once a legislative anomaly has arisen in our taxation law which does not assist the rich and powerful but actually benefits some beneficiaries of the social security system. This Bill will close this loophole. As I said, we considered opposing the measure, but we decided to support it as the existing situation may confer an unwarranted benefit on someone who has ceased receiving the benefit and who has obtained employment with a high remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal in the Bill to alter the timing of the creation of franking credits in a company's franking account is not opposed by us. Ironically, it appears that the change to a system where franking credits arise only where payments have been made has inadvertently eliminated an anomaly which existed in section 160ARX of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This section provides that, where a company overfranks a dividend during the year and the company's franking account is in deficit by more than 10 per cent of the total of the franking credits arising during the year, then a penalty of 30 per cent of the franking deficit tax which applies to the company will also be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current system involves the crediting of company tax instalments and then the crediting of the actual tax payable, with the previous company tax instalments being debited to reverse the earlier credits. Hence, the level of franking credits arising during the year is higher under the current system, which has a degree of double entry, even though the net balance in the franking account will not be affected by the proposed move in this Bill to a payment-only based system of franking credits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that companies will be liable to pay additional tax under this section on a much lower deficit in their franking accounts than is currently the case. We think that that outcome should have been legislated for in the first place. However, it is important to put on the record the fact that, although it appears that this change was not deliberately pursued by the Government, it is nevertheless a fortuitous consequence of the alteration of the timing of the creation of franking credits under the dividend imputation system. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would confirm this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to another important income tax matter, and this is the exemption granted to community service organisations. The Australian Democrats support income tax exemption for the community service sector and we voted for the existing exemption provision when it was introduced by the former Treasurer, Mr Keating. This exemption quite properly does not apply to bodies that have been established for political or lobbying purposes, including standing candidates for election or campaigning for changes to the law or to government policy. However, a community service organisation will not lose its exempt status if its political or lobbying activities are merely incidental to its main activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats agree with this exclusion of `political organisation'. However, the critical matter is how to define when a community organisation is a political one, or when any organisation is a political one. One such case has come to my attention, and this is the case of the Valentine Progress Association, in the Lake Macquarie area of New South Wales. The Newcastle branch of the tax office has determined this association to be taxable. We raised this matter in the chamber on 18 June. Senator McMullan responded that the tax office had issued a pamphlet which was over-general and said that it had been withdrawn. So we told the association this, and it was happy and confident that renting out a community hall to local groups would not be classified as a political activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the tax office did not agree and it levied a tax and a fine on the association. A member of the committee was, understandably, a little bit upset when he received a political advertisement in his letterbox in which the candidate made the point that he was a member of the local Rotary club. As we know, Rotary, Apex and Lions are all tax exempt, and so they should be. But I think that progress associations should not all be deemed to be political bodies when they are only providing services to the community which would not otherwise be provided. I would ask Senator McMullan, when he is here, to give a commitment to get an answer to this dilemma, as his original statement about this&mdash;although made in good faith, I am sure&mdash;does not appear to have fully covered the situation pertaining in the Newcastle area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final income tax matter that I wish to raise tonight concerns a recent Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision, and the reference is 22 ATR Case 4 October 1991. The case involved a taxpayer who manufactured tobacco products. In the 1988 tax year, the company paid almost half a million dollars to an industry association to fund a public relations campaign against the passing of legislation then pending in the parliaments of Victoria and South Australia. The legislation was to restrict tobacco sports advertising and to increase the State tax on tobacco products. I do not need to go into the technicalities of the decision, but the outcome was that the taxpayer won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that the Commonwealth, in effect, subsidised the campaign of the tobacco company to fight the advertising restrictions and the creation of the health promotion funds. The Australian Democrats believe that this is bad public policy and that no tobacco advertising expenditure should qualify for an income tax deduction&mdash;with no exceptions. This is especially so in a case such as this. I call on the Government to change the law so that such an expenditure is not allowable as a legitimate tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Treasurer, Mr Willis, said recently that the Government was considering a change in economic policy. While this is probably motivated by the intrigue of the leadership struggle, nevertheless it is a positive sign that the Labor Party is starting to recognise some of the damage that its policies have caused. I hope we will see a significant move away from the economic rationalist policies which have so significantly harmed this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating a package of taxation legislation, including the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991. Owing to time constraints, we are restricted in our contributions to this debate because we are now supposedly on the second last day of sitting for the year. As usual, the Government could not manage its way out of a telephone box, so we are now debating important pieces of legislation at the eleventh hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill that I wish to concentrate on is the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991, because in the overall context of this record taxing Labor Government the increase in fringe benefits tax for 1992-93 from 47 to 48.25 per cent may be considered almost trivial. It is certainly considered trivial by the Government, which has done very little, if anything, to help people in remote parts of Australia to be more profitable and more productive. It may do no more than bring the FBT into line with the top marginal rate plus the Medicare levy, but what we are really looking at is the overall impact of such a decision on remote Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of $1.3 billion to be raised through this tax in 1991-92 constitutes just under 2 per cent of total income tax revenue and 1 1/2 per cent of total taxation revenue. The coalition does not dispute the need to ensure that the more highly paid members of the work force are not able to avoid tax by receiving benefits in lieu of income, but we suggest that there be some fairness and equity in the way in which taxes are administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that we have put out our Fightback package in recent weeks to try to focus on those particular areas. Under the reform package of the coalition&mdash;the next government of Australia&mdash;the principle of FBT remains, because it will continue to be levied at the top marginal rate of tax plus the Medicare levy. But there is one major difference in our package: the top marginal tax rate will be reduced. This will properly be reduced ultimately to 43.25 per cent as we provide a top rate that will encourage incentive and make it worth while for people to work harder and longer. That is a marked difference between us and this Government, which is talking about a top rate at 48.25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, what the next Liberal and National Government will do is review the impact of this tax particularly on the mining, pastoral and tourist industries. This undertaking is of great importance to the north of Western Australia where, unquestionably, the fringe benefits tax has impacted on normal working and living conditions to the detriment of that and other remote regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only wish that the Government knew and understood exactly the impact of many of its policies. This afternoon some of us had the displeasure of hearing Senator Collins's utterances about how meek and mild our offers were to increase the zone allowance. But, of course, Senator Collins judiciously decided not to respond to any interjections, questions or queries about what this Government has done about the zone allowance in all the time that it has been in office. The answer, of course, is nothing. So how hypocritical can one be to accuse the coalition of not offering enough increase in the zone allowance to people living in remote Australia when this Government has done precisely nothing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The current application of the fringe benefits tax is a very real disincentive to the growth of stable population centres in remote, inhospitable, but nevertheless vitally significant, areas of Australia. Today, iron ore companies pay a $20m tax on the continued provision of community infrastructure in the Pilbara&mdash;the mining towns that were a direct consequence of agreement Acts passed by the Parliament of Western Australia. I find it rather staggering that this Government can continue to tax industries such as the iron ore industry at $20m and then turn around and wonder why they are not flourishing to the extent that they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would defy anyone to argue that home ownership schemes, holiday travel from isolated regions, subsidised power where air-conditioning is an absolute necessity of life and not some sort of fringe benefit that one can opt for, or a bus service to a mine site constitute benefits as a form of income minimisation. None of those is a form of income minimisation. They are simply forms of trying to make people more comfortable in remote Australia; they are also forms of trying to encourage people to go to the more remote areas of Australia. These are areas of the tax that require careful examination. These are areas that the next Liberal and National party Government will totally review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that accommodation and travel are subject to 50 per cent remote area discounting is an acknowledgment by this Government that they are not in fact fringe benefits but necessities. But that acknowledgment aside, the reality is that the Government taxes them as fringe benefits and not as necessities. Logically, it is fair to ask why they should be taxed at all. But, of course, as we know from this Government, `If it moves, tax it; and if it doesn't, you may as well tax it as well'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While many executive perks prior to the introduction of the FBT were liable for taxation in the hands of the recipient, the Commissioner of Taxation did not then regard remote area travel or subsidised township services as taxable benefits. It is time that they were reviewed, and that is what the Opposition has given a commitment to do when it is the next government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We talk a lot in this Parliament about level playing fields. Quite frankly, this is a term that I cannot stand because most of the people who talk about level playing fields really do not mean what they say and do not say what they mean. But members of the Hawke Labor Government often pay lip-service to this principle. Some, like Senator Walsh, actually believe in it. I ask, therefore: where is the equity in taxing mining companies for, in effect, providing infrastructure? It is to their financial advantage in the 1990s to build no new towns but rather to operate projects through fly-in, fly-out arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right. Even existing towns, of course, are now being confronted with this problem. It is expected that new projects in the Pilbara will operate the bulk of their work forces in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a jolly good idea if members of this Government, particularly the Minister and the Prime Minister&mdash;if we had a Prime Minister who was really an incumbent of the office&mdash;had a look at some of these areas to understand the full impact of the fly in, fly out arrangements and what they have done to the towns that are affected. It is not a matter of governments encouraging decentralisation through a larger Pilbara population, by interfering with the market, but rather of reviewing and reducing an existing distortion caused by the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern to me as a senator for Western Australia just what a detrimental effect the FBT is having on the health and viability of Pilbara communities. The FBT is raised with me every time I visit the north-west or every time I talk to anyone from the north-west. The FBT is slowly doing to these towns what the withdrawal of service personnel will do to Exmouth, further west in Western Australia. There would be absolutely no need for the FBT to be imposed on the people of the Pilbara if some logic and understanding of the real necessities were put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need only consider the fact that, in the four years between 1986 and 1990, while the population of Western Australia rose 12 per cent, by some 174,800 people, the population of the four Pilbara local authorities fell by 1.2 per cent, to 47,700. That is not a development which we would naturally expect when resource industries are healthy. We also have to look at the fact that this Government has pandered to the Greens and to every interest group so that in a time of need the Prime Minister can call up his debts and ask those interest groups to write nice letters to members of the Caucus asking them to keep him on as Prime Minister. The reality is that, unfortunately, people in remote Australia are suffering as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been of advantage to the growth engine of the Pilbara and indeed of Western Australia, the iron ore industry, that the provision of company housing stabilised the work force so that an initial turnover of 100 per cent reduced to only 15 per cent. That is a very significant change. The Government now provides a tax disincentive that would loom far larger if value added industries were to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should steel making ever begin in the Pilbara, with the consequent need for a larger and more permanent work force, it has been estimated that full FBT would impose a production cost of $3.75 for each input tonne of iron ore. This Government thinks that is okay. Surely this is a time when we need more development and more employment&mdash;there are over one million people unemployed in this country&mdash;yet every possible barrier is put in front of companies which provide employment and income for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Liberal-National government would not only review FBT, but would also bring about the abolition of payroll tax which penalises large employers and small employers alike, particularly the large employers in the Pilbara, such as mining companies and those who provide many jobs in the area. In the opinion of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures 175,000 jobs will emerge in the Pilbara as a result of this reform. It needs change; it needs reform. What is this Government offering with respect to a change in direction of policy, a redirection of policy and a reassessment of policy? It is offering absolutely nothing. The reason is that Treasury is locked away trying to blow the Fightback package out of the water and, therefore, the Government is unable&mdash;it is paralysed&mdash;to provide any change in direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not apologise for emphasising this situation of the Pilbara, but the misapplication of the FBT is far from being a purely Western Australian problem. In April last year, CRA informed the Industry Commission that overall the mining industry in 1988-89 had paid $15m in FBT for over 22,000 dwellings. BHP-Utah Coal stated in its submission that since 1986 it had paid $14.5m in FBT on the employment of 4,600 people in inland central Queensland, including $6.6m spent on housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same story in the Pilbara, with FBT levied on the provision of infrastructure where costs and conditions are unfavourable. In particular, from 1986 to 1990, $1.4m in FBT was paid for the provision of a bus service from a mining town to two mine sites 55 kilometres and 61 kilometres distant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good question from Senator Panizza. Perhaps the Government would prefer to see them ride pushbikes, but then, of course, the pushbikes would also be subject to FBT. This supposed executive perk does not even attract the 50 per cent remote area discount. It defies logic for this Government to claim that this is a fringe benefit when workers in metropolitan centres have their public transport subsidised by the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone questions that, let it be known that TransPerth admits to the Government of Western Australia that fares recover only 26 per cent of the cost of commuter services. When we can travel four kilometres across the Perth central business district for free, why should a Pilbara mining company pay full FBT on the full contract price of a company bus service from town to mine where, of course, there is no alternative transport other than private vehicles? I am certainly confident that we will look very carefully at such anomalies because they are a total and utter disincentive to the work force and to companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report of 25 February on mining and mineral processing, the Industry Commission acknowledged that FBT had increased the cost of providing remote area housing. It took note of the argument that this was necessary to prevent rapid labour turnover, and of the difficulties in compensating employees through the wages system. I regret that the Commission did not follow the logic of the evidence and recommend at least an extension of the remote area discounting. Once it is conceded that some form of infrastructure incentive is appropriate, why not allow it to be provided in the most efficient and workable manner? The Commission, like this Labor Government, missed the essential point that these so-called benefits in remote areas were never intended as a means of wage minimisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big difference between the approach of the coalition and the approach of the Labor Government towards the fringe benefits tax is that we have undertaken to review its impact in those areas where it is operating beyond its intention, to the detriment of Australian export industries and remote communities. This is just one more example of who is in touch with reality and who is looking for solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come up with the positive policy alternatives. When and where will the Government's policy alternatives appear?

We should compare the adhockery that we have endured in Australia for eight years with the coalition's offer of a massive tax reform package for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is offering Australia not only tax reform through a goods and services tax but also labour market reform, efficient infrastructure, a reform of government operations, privatisation, industry reform and environment and development reform. In fact, we are offering a vision that will provide opportunities to all Australians instead of throwing them onto the scrap heap, as this Government has done. Our package is genuine and thorough in its attempt to address many of the serious economic, social and geographic problems. Senator Knowles alluded tonight to geographic problems in the north-western parts of Western Australia and how the residents there are being taxed out of existence with the fringe benefits tax. The Australians who live in those areas are not being given the incentive to get out and develop Australia. The coalition is making an honest attempt to face up to Australia's problems, and that is the difference between us and the Hawke-Willis Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was absolutely mute a couple of weeks ago when we tried to get the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to debate the package in the House of Representatives, which they would not do. We have had some small debates here, to which some of my colleagues have already alluded. There have been some skirmishes with the Government occasionally saying, `We have found some holes in your goods and services tax package'. In the last few weeks since we came out with our goods and services tax package and our vision for Australia the Government has been absolutely obsessed with trying to knock holes in our package instead of saying what the Labor Government will do for the current million and a half unemployed and the 30 per cent youth unemployment figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing is currently being done by this Government. It is an absolute indictment on the Hawke-Keating-Kerin-Willis-Beazley- Crean or whatever Government one would like to have at the moment. One could perhaps include anyone else who is throwing his or her hat into the ring. There is now an absolute blatant grab for power instead of care for the unemployed, including unemployed youth, in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has claimed in various media in the last month or two that he would destroy the goods and services tax that we have come up with. He also said that he might even borrow from it. I believe that the Prime Minister has been trying to have a bob each way for too long. We have seen how successful that approach has been; it has been absolutely abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our approach is up-front and, above all, it is equitable because it wipes the slate clean of seven taxes which have been added to and taken away from for years. Tonight we are again debating another change to the tax system and another little touching of the edges. This fiddling at the edges has increased inequities, unbalanced the economy and made our tax system one of the most cumbersome in the world. The latest increase in the fringe benefits tax from 47 cents in the dollar to 48.25 per cent is just another example of the Government's higgledy-piggledy approach to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will not stop any problems that the Government might think are presently occurring with the FBT. As our package suggests, under the existing tax arrangements there is an incentive for employees and employers to structure remuneration packages to take advantage of the gap between the fringe benefits tax rate of 48.25 per cent and the corporate tax rate of 39 per cent. Our decision to lower the fringe benefits tax rate and align it with the top corporate rate will significantly close any loopholes in it and will make it a much more fair and equitable way to handle fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those in the business world, the tax package will mean more incentive to explore, employ and create work. The Liberal-National Party will abolish payroll tax. Fuel excises will go, tax on business inputs will be rebated and business will be back in the business of creating work and generating jobs. The depressed economy that we have at the moment&mdash;caused by former Treasurer Keating and the Labor Party&mdash;our growing unemployment queues, rising bankruptcies and soaring interest rates have all inhibited business in Australia for perhaps the last eight years, ever since the Labor Party came to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in this debate, Government senators suggested that the Opposition package meant that greed was good. I do not think they quite understand that productivity and incentive must be encouraged in industry. They have been missing in Australia for much too long. I think the latest balance of payments figures show that. The drop in housing approvals of 2.4 per cent means that Australia is another $1 billion plus in debt this month. It means, quite simply, that the Government has not stopped the rot and that it does not have control of the economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy raises far less than health services actually cost in this country, and I am quite sure that Senator Patterson will allude to this, as she is one of the Opposition's experts in health care.

The levy raises, as I said, far less than health services actually cost in this country, so it is just another contributor to our massive debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy has also assisted in generating the notion, which is becoming increasingly prevalent in our society, that Medicare is paid for by the government so it is there for the taking and for abuse. Few stop to think just where and how the Government gets its money. Medicare is not an efficient use of the public dollar, and we in the Liberal and National parties have been game enough to say so and to suggest that those who can afford to pay for their own health services ought to be encouraged to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health services in this country are in chaos and in poverty, and in large measure it is the fault of the Labor Government.

People are literally dying before they get to the head of the queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the Government's position, our package proposes assistance to those on low incomes to encourage them to take private health cover. For those over 65 who earn less than $12,000 a year for single people or $14,500 for married couples, tax credits equivalent to the full cost of basic private health insurance will be provided. Not only will this save $1 billion in public health outlays; it will take the pressure off the existing overworked public health system. This is another example of bringing fairness back into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some seven years ago we had a balance of payments deficit of $7 billion. This year it is some $16 billion. When the Hawke Labor Government came to power the Government took $35 billion from the taxpayers of Australia in income tax revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on just one of the Bills currently before the Senate, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. The purpose of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991 is to increase the threshold above which the Medicare levy is imposed on people who have a spouse or dependants. This threshold will increase from $19,045 to $19,674. Medicare is partly&mdash;and I emphasise `partly'&mdash;funded through a 1 1/4 per cent levy on taxable income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Collections from the Medicare levy in 1990-91 totalled $2,480m which, it should be noted, is 9.3 per cent lower than the forecasts in the 1990-91 Budget. It has been estimated that in 1991-92 Medicare levy collections will total $2,580m. I cannot let this opportunity pass with the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill before the Senate without commenting on the inequities, the inefficiencies and the inadequacies of Medicare and the Hawke Government's health system. Firstly, this Government has told one big lie and misled the Australian public into believing that the Medicare levy pays for the health care of all Australians. Nothing is further from the truth. The Medicare levy covers only one-eighth of the real cost to the Federal, State and local governments of providing health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said previously, the current Medicare levy is expected to raise only $2.58 billion this year, which is less than one-fifth of the expected $13.7 billion. Who pays the difference? It is obviously the Australian public via their taxes, via their private health insurance and via the gap. As the payment of the Medicare levy is not directly related to the use of health care services, there is no price disincentive to prevent overuse. Indeed, many have said that, since they have to pay the levy whether they use the system or not, they may as well use health care services as much as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest problems in the current system is the encouragement of bulkbilling. As the Opposition has said time and time again, the absence of a price signal only leads to overuse and overservicing. The Auditor-General, in Audit Report No. 32 of 1990-91, clearly indicates that there is an association between the overuse of medical services and the incidence of bulkbilling. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is notable that, generally speaking, the areas with the highest growth in outlays are those with a high proportion of direct billing.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services dismissed the comments of the Auditor-General, claiming that it had tried to mirror the results of the Audit Office but that it could not. The Department's conclusion was that there was obviously not a link between bulkbilling and the incidence of overuse and overservicing. However, this is not the only piece of evidence to which the Department and the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) are turning a blind eye. </PARA>

We never mind the evidence which shows that in Tasmania, where only 55 per cent of GP services are bulkbilled, the per capita cost is $191 whereas in New South Wales, with 75 per cent bulkbilling, the cost goes up to $250 per capita. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have there been the widespread problems of overuse and overservicing, but also the hospital system is plagued by chronic waiting lists. The system is so bad that something like 700,000 pensioners hold some kind of private health insurance. They are frightened at the prospect of being subjected to the whims of Medicare and, in particular, the thought of being left without a hospital bed when they require elective surgery. Each of these pensioners is paying $200 or more for private cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for this Government whose Ministers today stand here talking about the poor when it has pensioners paying for private health insurance because they are too scared to take the risk of trusting this Government, which they now know never keeps its promises. The pensioners get no incentive, help or encouragement from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest problems in our health system has been the dramatic reduction in the percentage of the population covered by private health insurance. In 1983, 70 per cent of the population had some private health cover. In 1990 that level had fallen to about 45 per cent of the population. The system has been grossly unfair to those who have chosen to take out private health insurance. It has pushed up private health insurance costs because insurance funds are left with a higher proportion of high risk cases as healthier, younger people drop their insurance. By discouraging the taking out of private health insurance, the Government has placed the burden of the nation's health costs directly onto the taxpayer. As funds have become increasingly scarce, the system has been starved of resources, resulting in rationing of services, running down and dilapidation of hospitals, excessive burdens on health professionals and the deterioration of the quality of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not the only problems in our health system. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of diagnostic services disproportionate to the increase in the population. The number of doctors has increased by 50 per cent in the last 10 years. The gaps between medical fees and Medicare funds have increased. The costs of the public health sector have increased by 163 per cent in the last 10 years and there is a maldistribution of health personnel. Our health system is in a mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's present policy of so-called free health has led to a grossly inefficient and unstable health care delivery system that can no longer be sustained. All the Government does is tinker at the edges. It is straitjacketed by its narrow ideological thinking. What we need is a coalition government that will transform Medicare into a viable, stable system of quality health care. Our reforms will: retain and improve Medicare; guarantee all Australians access to high quality health care; reduce waiting lists in public hospitals; contain the costs of public health care; and restore the balance between the public and private health sectors by encouraging individuals to provide for their own health care through private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 December, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Brian Howe, launched what was supposed to be the first part of a concerted attack on the Fightback program. However, what we got from Minister Howe was a whimper, particularly when it was discovered that he had his figures wrong. In two of his media releases Minister Howe had fundamental inaccuracies and was forced to admit that he was wrong. His media release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Australians who are not card holders or pensioners would be forced, under an Opposition health policy, to take out private health insurance', the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Brian Howe, said today.</PARA>
<PARA>That was totally wrong. The coalition's policy is to require single income earners above $40,000 who do not take out private health insurance to pay a maximum levy of $400 per annum, and families with an income of over $50,000 will pay a maximum levy of $800 per annum. All those Australians earning less than $30,000 per annum will be given a tax credit to assist them in taking out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Australians will be better off under our health system. Under our policy, assistance will be provided to age pensioners to take out private health insurance; we will not have pensioners struggling to pay because they are scared of the system, as is the case under this Government. As I said, some 30 per cent of pensioners already take out private health insurance. Hundreds of thousands of families will be given an incentive under the coalition's Fightback package to take out private health insurance and will have access to the underutilised health services in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is certain from Minister Howe's media conference and that is that he has very little credibility. Firstly, the Minister presides over a health system that is chronically ill and he refuses to admit that there is a massive problem. Secondly, he fronts up at a media conference and he gets his facts wrong. Thirdly, he floats some suggestion that there is a $2 billion hole in the policy and provides little substantiation for this figure. Is it any wonder that nobody believes him?</PARA>

In other words, increasing the Government's level by 25 per cent is a pittance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am moved to observe, as I look at the Government's proposal for the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, that it is increasing the threshold from $19,045 to $19,674, which will have a zero effect on revenue this year and a mere pittance of an effect at $10m next year. What Senator Collins failed to observe was that not only will we increase the zone allowance by 25 per cent, but we will also have a thorough review to examine any anomalies which exist to ensure that people in the remote and isolated areas of Australia are not disadvantaged by their choice to be at the frontier of Australia's development and growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move quickly to the fringe benefits tax. While I did not hear most of Senator Knowles's speech, I am certain that she would have touched upon the areas of consequence that affect mining areas, particularly of Western Australia. It is not without significance to note that, since the introduction of fringe benefits tax, there has not been one new town developed in Western Australia. Until that point, we had Dampier and we had Karratha; and we had expansions in Port Hedland, Kununurra, Tom Price, Newman, Paraburdoo and Pannawonica. Western Australia literally blossomed with new towns, new development, new infrastructure, new growth and new wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the fringe benefits tax was not the only barring feature&mdash;that all happened, of course, under a Liberal government. To my memory, not one of those towns was started under the Labor Government which followed the Liberal Government. Perhaps there are two notable reasons for that. The Liberal Party has also said in its package&mdash;which this Government says it is striving to destroy&mdash;that it will review anomalies in respect of that also, not the least being in mining areas, pastoral areas and tourist areas. There clearly are some anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it now that the resource development areas of Western Australia are serviced by fly in, fly out staff and crew? It is because it is cheaper for mining companies and shareholders to put on an aircraft to fly these people in and have them live in basically spartan conditions, divorced from the reality of a natural living environment; fly them out again at the expiration of their period of work; and have a new crew fly back in again. Argyle is a good example, although the contemporary royal commission tells us that there are some added reasons&mdash;reasons, I might say, which pollute proper integrity&mdash;for there not being a town in Argyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Argyle was one of the first to adopt this practice. The lead-zinc mine at Cajuput, between Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing, is another company that chose to fly in and fly out its workers rather than create the infrastructure for a living vibrant community in the heart of the remote areas of Western Australia. Mines are taxed for providing necessary inevitable accommodation for their employees. A mine could hardly say to its employees, `You've got a job with us at Cajuput', which is X hundreds of kilometres from nowhere, `provided you can find your own accommodation'. How absolutely absurd!  The same situation applies in respect of the pastoral industry. Do we expect a farmer to say, `You can work on my station, provided you can find your own accommodation'?  Do we expect employers of people working in remote hotels or motels in Western Australia to say, `You have got a job as a housekeeper or a barmaid provided you can find your own accommodation'? What an absolute nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this tax is simply an add-on cost of labour to these operations with no material benefit to either the employee or the employer but a significant disincentive for the expansion, development, growth, prosperity and wealth of Australia. If there is something to be gained, it appears to me from my superficial observations and empirical evidence that the level of industrial disputation seems to have gone down in those mines that have fly-in, fly-out operations. I can only imagine that that is because the employees have other jobs. People spend a fortnight in Argyle and another fortnight at their little hobby farm. They are interested only in getting up there and earning cash. They then invest this money in developing the south-west or whatever other beautiful parts of Western Australia they want to live in. To that extent, I suspect that this arrangement has had some material benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People living in Broome and working in Cajuput want to make sure that they are getting paid for lying on Cable Beach. If they were on strike they would not be paid. To that extent, I think this arrangement has had some sobering influence. But in real terms it has had a decimating effect on development in Western Australia. Many projects are at present in the pipeline. No doubt many more will be considered. However, magnificent towns which would form an intrinsic part of the fibre, culture and fabric of Western Australia will not be built because of the rigid, inflexible and artificial way in which this fringe benefits tax is imposed. We propose to conduct a proper review of any anomalies that we find, notwithstanding this Government saying that it will do all it can to ensure that we do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991. If ever there was an area of government service that has been plunged into absolute chaos and failure, it is the health system of Australia. I well remember Mr Hayden's promise to provide cheap or free quality health readily to all Australians. He was rigidly driven by an ideological belief&mdash;but also presumably altruism&mdash;of some egalitarian notion without understanding the implications of such a system. The health services and the health delivery system in Australia tragically have never been worse. The fact is that the public hospital systems in the States and the Territories&mdash;and that is all I have time to speak about tonight&mdash;are in absolute chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I went to a doctor in the ACT who told me that he had had a visit from another athletic young man in this town, who had discovered that his times around the lake had deteriorated somewhat. He was feeling run down, so he went for a check-up. On careful examination, the doctor found that this man had the most virile form of stomach cancer there is. The recovery rate, even after operations, is about 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the doctor promptly got on the telephone to book this man in for an operation. This is in Canberra, with all its wonderful hospitals&mdash;the Calvary Hospital, the Royal Canberra Hospital and the Woden Valley Hospital.

This man was going to die because the system could not find him one rotten, stinking bed. That is in an affluent city such as Canberra. We are supposed to believe that we have a cheap system, a quality system which is readily available to all people, yet no hospital could provide this young man with a bed to save his life. Tragically, that is not a bad example; that is not an aberration; that is not an exception. That is the rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this system, which Senator Patterson touched upon, that has driven up the number of visits to doctors and the number of people seeking beds, and there is no empiric or classic evidence that the quality of health in Australia has improved as a result of having this system. Australians are hospitalised and visit their doctors at a greater level than people in almost any other country in the OECD. In Australia the rate of hospital admissions is 22.6 per cent. In the UK, another country with a free system, it is 15.8 per cent. We seem to learn from these other systems. The USA rate is 14.7 per cent and in the Netherlands, which I think charges people, it is 11 per cent. The tragedy is that as the number of these visits, the number of people going into hospital and the number of people on waiting lists go up, the number of hospital beds available goes down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own State of Western Australia alone, between 1988 and 1990 there was an increase of 34 per cent in the number of people on the waiting list. There are presently 10,000 people, out of a population of a little more than one million, on the waiting list&mdash;just waiting to go into hospital to have an operation to get well. Two thousand of them have been on the waiting list for 12 months or more. That is with this fabulous, mystical system given to us by this Government, under which health care is but a phone call away for anybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are about 70,000 people on public waiting lists throughout Australia. No doubt Senator McMullan will say, `That is elective surgery&mdash;a luxury. Most of those people are probably people who are feeling good now and want to feel super-good. There is a difference between terribly unwell people and people who just want to feel normal'. The definition of `elective surgery' now includes operations to remove cataracts and surgery such as hip replacements, throat operations, nose operations, ear operations and heart bypasses&mdash;the sort of stuff that keeps people alive. It is `elective' not for the person but for the system, as to whether a person lives or dies and whether a person has quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about knee operations or back operations&mdash;all those things that make a person feel more human?  That is elective; that is optional; that is the top-of-the-range stuff, above and beyond normal health care in Australia. In June 1986 the total number of beds in public hospitals was 69,739. In June 1990 that number had fallen to 63,574. That was not simply because Australians were feeling really well. That was not because this country is full of Lazaruses who all got up and went home. That was simply because bed numbers were contracting because State governments could not afford to service them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are all sorts of examples of that. My own mother died of cancer recently. In her ward alone half of the beds were closed. She was having chemotherapy like everybody else in the ward. When people have chemotherapy, their blood count is down to billyo and they only have to have a visitor cough on them and they promptly die. What happened was that the person with the lowest blood count got a single bed ward. The person with the next lowest went into a double ward. People with the next lowest blood count went into a four-bed ward. It was Russian roulette as to whether they got a bed in a single ward that provided them with an opportunity to be insulated from the sort of infection which is inevitable through contact with other people in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 there were 734 public hospitals. In 1990 there were 702&mdash;again, driven not by efficiencies, not by health, but simply by funding. The Royal Perth Hospital in Western Australia has had funding cuts and, in fact, has suspended elective surgery on every fourth Friday because of cuts to its budget. It does not mean that on every fourth Friday nobody needs an operation. It does not mean that on every fourth Friday the whole of metropolitan Perth is well. It simply means that operations are suspended because the hospital cannot afford them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recently had a case where a lady was admitted, prepped, shaved and anaesthetised ready for the operation and woke up to find herself ready to be dressed and sent home because hospital staff were not available. She was a 68-year-old woman, if I remember correctly. She had been prepped for the operation and had gone through the trauma and anxiety that we all do, never mind at that age, in readiness for this relatively serious operation, only to discover that it had been called off&mdash;I was going to say at the death knock, but I should say at the last minute. The tragedy is that there are 7,000 to 8,000 empty beds in private hospitals now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though we do not have the infrastructure; it is not as though we do not have the facilities. The trouble is that we do not have the common sense; and we do not have a sensible, balanced, proper, humane approach to health care problems in Australia. In Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia between 1987 and 1990, 1,600 beds were closed because the hospitals simply could not afford to fund them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it is not because Australians are getting any healthier. Every Australian visits a doctor approximately eight times a year. This compares with an average of 4.5 visits annually in the United Kingdom and 3.5 visits in the Netherlands. Yet we have a system which cannot deliver us proper health care. As Senator Patterson said, we have this absurd system&mdash;Senator McMullan could not honestly look me in the eye and say that we do not&mdash;which causes both overuse and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government has the courage to put an up-front fee&mdash;not a real figure but a figure just to introduce a modicum of price sensitivity, a figure just to introduce the notion of cost&mdash;its ideologically hell-bent members, with their continuing obsession for free medicine, knock it on the head. It is now being used as an artificial excuse, as the bridge across which to march, to vote for Mr Keating. I do not have the exact figure but, of course, the cost of health services in Australia is about $26 billion. But we are given this absurd indication that the Medicare levy in some way pays that. Of course, it does not; it pays a very modest part of that. I conclude by saying that I get no satisfaction out of any of the legislation that is presently before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyone listening to the debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill and associated Bills could be excused for not realising that we are actually dealing with some fairly important pieces of taxation legislation, none of which I heard referred to in the debate this evening. The debate on the earlier occasion did, and I will deal with some of the points raised later. I want to make clear that the important parts of this tax package relate to elements of the package announced in the March industry statement, and this is a further stage in the implementation of the package. We dealt with the sales tax legislation last week. We have a further set of measures concerning depreciation which will be introduced into the House of Representatives tomorrow. We also have this package which deals with some important parts of the package: for example, retention and extension of the research and development concession for industry and deductability of environmental impact statement expenditure, et cetera. Some of the major changes that were announced in the March statement are being implemented on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a large number of other changes, which, as part of the macro tax system, are minor changes, although in each instance they are important to the individuals affected by them. There is also the implementation of some Budget changes to do with mining and prospecting and with valueless shares, and there are associated Bills which essentially are of a minor machinery nature. During this debate we had a couple of major excursions into the Medicare area. I do not want to take up a lot of time at 10 minutes past 10 to pursue all those tangents. There has been much sound, fury and concern about overuse and overservicing. Everyone always wishes to have a better health service and more services available, although I have to say that in the recent experience of my own family the service has been first class in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, and nor does the person I am referring to; it was not I but a very close relative of mine. However, at this stage I do not want to pursue the points that were raised in debate, because there will be plenty of debates on Medicare on more appropriate occasions both here and elsewhere, and that will be the appropriate time for that to occur. I simply say that the evidence makes it very clear that, by international standards or by Australian traditional standards, Medicare has been very successful in its cost containment. Whatever else honourable senators opposite may say about it and all these allegations about the cost of Medicare and the cost of health care in Australia, as a percentage of GDP the costs of health provision in Australia are and remain remarkably low and have been remarkably stable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is very low by any standard.

There are very few examples, and none with the sort of service that the Opposition is advocating, which can come close to that level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That really takes us out at a bit of a tangent on this legislation. I want to deal with some of the substance of what honourable senators raised in the time I have available; I do not want to abuse the privilege of the Senate's giving me some time to sum up. Much of what Senator Watson raised will be covered in the committee stage, so I will not duplicate now what we will deal with then. Many of his concerns were also covered in the earlier Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration hearing on this legislative package, although I will refer to some things which I undertook to do there with regard to tabling. I will come to that later during this summing up but otherwise I will not go over the matters covered in that hearing and which are recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, some extra matters were raised during this second reading debate, mainly by Senator Watson, although I wish to refer to a couple of matters raised by other honourable senators. Senator Watson raised a concern about the quarantining of the Attwood matter. I reiterate my previous indication that the Government's intention is that the amendment be quarantined to offshore oil and gas rig workers. That remains our intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had much discussion and some correspondence about camp allowances and the application of fringe benefits tax. I do not want to take too long with this matter because it can be a very complicated debate. The fringe benefits tax law provides that an allowance, including a camp allowance, will be a living away from home allowance fringe benefit if it is concluded that the allowance is paid to compensate an employee for additional expenses incurred or other additional disadvantages to which the employee is subject because the employee is required to live away from home in order to perform duties of employment. If the allowance is not paid for these purposes it will be subject to income tax in the hands of the employee. That covers most of the points raised in the debate. </PARA>

Cash payments made under an award of that sort have always been subject to fringe benefits rather than income tax. There has been no extension of the policy in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson also raised a concern about the auditing of the ATO's situation with regard to fringe benefits tax itself. The Australian National Audit Office in particular ensures that the Taxation Office meets its obligations and the Department of Finance also monitors that matter because its requirements have to be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also some debate about the treatment of taxi fares for employees who are required to work after normal working hours. Where such a benefit is provided on a very occasional basis the minor benefits exemption would apply. It would not apply to regular transport provided to shift workers or others who regularly work late hours. Those guidelines which apply to all employers apply to the Taxation Office as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the debate at the Finance and Public Administration Committee hearing Senator Watson asked me to table two taxation rulings which are relevant to this general area of debate in this Bill. Without going to them in detail, I table taxation rulings Nos IT 2569 and 2570 for the information of honourable senators. There will be some other matters covered by Government amendments which I will come to in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza raised a matter to which I wish to reply. He said that in the past we have reviewed annually the provisional tax uplift factor and asked why it was not in the Bill on this occasion. The situation is simply that last year we changed the law to provide that the factor be set at 10 per cent in the legislation, unless the Parliament otherwise provides. It was not set for a specific time last year and therefore it has a continuing effect. That is why it is not here, as it is no longer required to be an annual event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot raised a question with regard to imputation credits and sought confirmation that the Bill corrects a deficiency in the existing law. I can confirm that the amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) will correct the deficiency she referred to and result in a situation where there will be no double counting of credits, as can occur under the existing law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that in some senses that does not do credit to all the points that honourable senators have raised but, in terms of responding to new matter, I think it does.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, if it were not a quarter past 10 it would be delightful. But I do want to deal with two aspects of the Fightback package that relate specifically to the two amendments. When I spoke earlier today, I said that it amounted to&mdash;I used more colourful language, but let me be more moderate here&mdash;deliberately misleading the Senate to claim that the Fightback package would create two million jobs, because the two million jobs figure in the document is not based on, and cannot be remotely considered to be based on, the policy provisions in that package. The high road scenario in the Access Economics analysis is not an analysis of the Fightback package and does not pretend to be. Nobody can honestly claim that it is, because the tax package does not even include a goods and services tax. It is an assessment of an interesting scenario. It may or may not be a correct assessment, but that is a totally different debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come in here and say that the Fightback package will create two million jobs because a completely different scenario, which happens by chance to be reported in the same document, would create two million jobs amounts to deliberately misleading the Senate. To find it in writing in this amendment is scandalous. It is deliberately misleading. Certainly the mover of this amendment, Senator Herron,  must have known that the document that refers to the two million jobs bears no relationship to the policy that is being advocated, and that the policy that is being advocated is back to the old formula of dealing with unemployment by putting people out of work, just as it deals with inflation by putting up prices and deals with the living standards of Australian workers by cutting real wages. That is what this package does. It is a fairly conventional conservative formula dressed up in tinsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The only other point I want to make relates to the further amendment that is being proposed, I understand, by Senator MacGibbon, expressing concern that the Government may be going to take further measures. We get the situation where, if the Government does not propose to change policy, there is concern that it is just the same old package; if we do propose new policies, there are allegations that somehow or other this is a very bad thing and there should not be any such changes. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fact is that the Australian people will get plenty of opportunity to debate the relative merits of the package. I do not intend at 10.20 this evening to take it any further than those responses. With regard to the more outrageous of the criticisms that were run and that are dotted through the amendments, we had a debate this afternoon which I thought was a bit of a waste of time, so I certainly do not intend to duplicate it here. The second readings are being supported by all honourable senators, and I thank them for that support. I will debate the detail in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA>In moving those amendments, I acknowledge the Government's action in moving and accepting in principle three amendments to the original legislation. Under the first amendment, the taxpayer is able to write off a loss against current or future capital gains in circumstances where the company is in liquidation. I thank the Government for the recognition of the benefit that will give to taxpayers. I also acknowledge the Government's second amendment to the original legislation, which provides a vehicle whereby after 120 days a taxpayer can, in circumstances where an objection is in dispute with the Australian Taxation Office, have that objection deemed to be resolved in the negative. That gives the taxpayer the option of going directly to court or the AAT. Following the third amendment, in the committee stage of the legislation many weeks ago the coalition drew attention to the consequence of the withdrawal of Part V, that is, the potential of the taxpayer being denied the dual option of going to the AD(JR) and using the tax mechanism in the event of certain appeals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thank the Government for these three amendments. We believe that they make a substantial improvement to the legislation. There are two other amendments which we are presently dealing with in the committee stage of debate. We acknowledge some recognition by the Government of environmental impact statement costs. We believe that the regime as presented before this Parliament is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is therefore proposing&mdash;and we seek the support of the Democrats&mdash;that environmental impact expenses be deductible in the following circumstances: where the project proceeds, expenditure is to be written off over three years; where the project does not proceed, the expenditure is to be deductible outright. We think it is only just and equitable that where the project does not proceed expenditure can be written off forthwith, particularly as, in those circumstances, no asset has been created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is really serious about its commitment to environmental issues it should accept the amendment that we are proposing. In most new projects nowadays, the law, Federal, State or local, requires an environmental impact study to be undertaken. Therefore expenditure can be regarded as a necessary and legitimate expense of operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments from industry on the Government's planned 10-year write-off note that this is out of line with the relevant accounting standards which would require full write-off in the year of expenditure. Even the Opposition acknowledges that it would like to go along the path of outright deduction. We do state that in some circumstances an asset has been created and therefore a three-year regime is applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Kernot for giving me prior knowledge that the Democrats intend to accept this Opposition amendment. This certainly adds credibility to the Democrats' concerns for the environment of this world. It is a legitimate cost and one which should be acknowledged in a much firmer and more meaningful way than what the Government is proposing by way of a 10-year write-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government were to accept the coalition amendments enabling a write-off of expenditure over three years it would come at the forefront of tax sensitivity to business environmental expenditures. We are pressing for this amendment to be accepted. It was raised at the committee stage. It was a 12 March proposal. It was therefore not a Budget measure that we were tampering with in its true sense. We have to send certain signals to the Government that it does not raise kites and does not follow up immediately. We have some concerns about the techniques that have been used. There is also an inconsistency in the Government's approach to a recognition of the write-off of certain expenses, for example, exploration expenses in the mining industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already said that my second amendment involves a revised deductibility regime for environmental impact expenditure. I will now refer to my first amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is concerned about the discrimination against the banking system. We seek to rectify that with our first amendment. Honourable senators will be aware that the amendments now before the Committee are in slightly different terms from those of the original amendment. We have noted the observations of the Australian Taxation Office and the Government about the original amendment. We believe that the first amendment to clause 31, page 17, which amends the definition of `return', clarifies the position and rectifies an earlier problem. We therefore seek the support of the Government and the Australian Democrats in removing this unfortunate distinction, which would tend to work against the banking system. It is an unintentional drafting error. I believe that this amendment seeks to clarify that position so as not to disadvantage the banking sector vis-a-vis all other sectors in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it in a nutshell, I will give a simple example. If the Commonwealth Bank wishes to encourage new account holders by offering a trip to Fiji, that can be deemed to be part of the return under the original legislation. We believe that is somewhat unfair compared with the example of a cordial manufacturer who may offer a trip to Fiji if a person buys cordials by the crate. If a person is successful, the prize or the lottery in such a circumstance is not related to the return on the investment. We fully support the notion that if a prize, game, lottery or something like that is given in addition to, or as part of, the inducement for the return then it is an acceptable provision that that be part of that income earning stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I wish to commend the two amendments which I believe are justifiable as an improvement to the legislation. I thank the Government for its three earlier amendments to the original legislation. </PARA>

I think it is true that an accelerated rate of deduction for environmental impact statements will definitely reduce the cost of such statements to the businesses concerned. I guess that that may have the long term effect of improving the attitude of business to the whole environmental impact statement process. I suppose we could say that it might even improve the quality of some of the environmental impact statements themselves. I can see the arguments that Senator Watson is advancing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My considerations also involve the matter of the cost of the implementation of this amendment. That does concern me. My first sentiments were to say, `I think we could point to a lot of other places where the Government ought to be encouraged to spend similar amounts of money'. For example, last week we heard the CSIRO predicting that in 20 years some western suburbs of Sydney will be virtually uninhabitable because of the effects of smog. We have the catastrophe of the toxic blue-green algae in our waterways. We could argue that here is a sum of money which could be set aside by the Government for quite important environmental projects. However, I indicate that, on balance, I think this is a positive move to change the attitude of business and to lead to an improvement in the environmental impact statement process in the long term. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with Senator Watson's two amendments. Firstly, I thank him for his cooperation in allowing that procedural matter to be handled in that way. We could not have done it without his cooperation, and I thank him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the amendment to the definition of `return' to deal with investment related lottery winnings, we have discussed this before because, to some extent, it came up during the hearings of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I understand that Senator Watson is concerned that in some way or another we are discriminating against banking or perhaps some more broadly defined financial sector. Let me make it clear, first of all, that we do not think there is a perception of discrimination against the banking fraternity. The situation will be the same for anybody offering similar inducements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern with this amendment is in two parts. One is that the test as proposed by Senator Watson's revised form of amendment may well exclude all investment related lottery winnings from the tax net, because investment related lotteries are provided to make particular investments more attractive when compared with other investments. It is just another form of competitive attraction of funds in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further proposed amendment appears to require that the lottery chance be chosen by the investor as an alternative to more income under the same investment. The real choice for investors is between investments offering a lottery chance and investments offering other advantages&mdash;perhaps a slightly higher interest rate but with no chance of winning the prize&mdash;and not between the particular advantages that might otherwise be available under the same investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill asks whether the chance is provided in respect of an investment and ensures that winnings will be taxable only if they relate to an investment. That ensures that the winning chance is provided as part of the return on the investment. That is already required in the way the Bill is drafted, so I do not think the proposed amendment is either necessary or appropriate. I think Senator Watson is finding a mischief that is not there and then going to great lengths to try to avoid that problem. My advice is that that is not necessary and not appropriate. I will leave it at that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we are trying to talk about the taxation of prizes that will be assessable under the provision where there is a chance giving rise to a prize being provided in respect of an investment. I do not think we need go any further. I think that covers the problem and the concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the procedural matters that were being debated here I did not hear every detail of Senator Watson's point but, as I heard it, the principle was fundamentally the same as that which he raised at the hearings of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In a sense, no, it is not relevant to the problem we are confronting. We are not trying here to confront the circumstance where someone is offering an inducement in the normal course, but where, instead of higher interest rates, part of the return on an investment is the potential to win a prize. It is a disguised form of income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any prize of that sort, whether it is offered by a bank, a finance company or a company floating shares and providing an inducement in that manner or a measurable potential for greater return to attract one to take out its shares, would similarly be treated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole purpose of the committee debate is to remove the sort of uncertainty that Senator McMullan has been alluding to. I beg to differ with the explanation he has offered. It would be unfortunate if taxpayers were put in the unenviable position of having to learn the implications of the legislation by going through what could be a bad experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) mentioned that the principle is essentially the same as that which I raised at the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The principle is, indeed, exactly the same. But I would submit that the argument presented in the chamber tonight was essentially the logical argument in relation to amendment No. 1 that the Parliamentary Secretary presented to that Standing Committee on Friday, 15 November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned during my speech tonight that the Opposition took cognisance of the matters that were raised by the Government and by the Australian Taxation Office and, for that reason, we revised the original amendment, and I now read it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . definition of `return'. . .</PARA>
<PARA>And essentially we are interested in this concept of a return on an investment; but we are adding the words:</PARA>

<PARA>and they are the operative words, `as a substitute'&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>That clarifies it and puts it beyond reasonable doubt, and people do not necessarily have to find the implications of the legislation through a bad experience.

My independent advisers tell me that this is the way to go, and we will certainly press the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not yet responded to the environmental impact expenditure amendment; I am dealing only with this part of the Bill first. There are two aspects to our concern. Firstly, there is the general concern I made known in November and which I reiterated today; but, secondly, there is an extra element that explicitly relates to the form of words of the amendment before us now, which is that the test, as proposed, could well&mdash;and my advice is that it would be likely to&mdash;exclude all investment related lottery winnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we start pursuing hypothetical examples, we may debate the example instead of the principle. But let me give a situation where company A is offering a 10 per cent return on investment and company B is offering a 10 per cent return and a one in 10,000 chance of winning $1m. As to the measurable extra benefit, the one in 10,000 chance of winning $1m, it appears, and the implications of the words are, that that is not covered by Senator Watson's amendment&mdash;yet that is quite clearly a return on that investment. The person is getting X per cent plus an opportunity to win. The Government is concerned that that is a return and it ought to be taxable, but that it would not be taxable under the amendment. That is our concern. The amendment is neither appropriate nor necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity, so we do not all have to get up too often, also to talk about the environmental impact expenditures aspect. I am concerned that a problem I was not aware of may arise if this amendment is accepted. As well, there might be significant revenue implications. I am not only concerned about that; I am also concerned that there is a question of principle as well. I think it is appropriate&mdash;and it might be fair criticism of the Government to say that this is overdue&mdash;that we should recognise environmental impact expenditures for tax purposes. In the course of the second reading debate a couple of people made a bit of a point that perhaps we should have done this earlier. I think there is a case for saying that. We recognised it in March and we are implementing it here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to say, `We are going to recognise environmental impact expenditure for tax purposes over the proposed life of the project to which the expenditure relates'. That is a perfectly proper principle and there is no need to pursue it further; it is not argued between us here. As far as I know, everyone in the Senate agrees with that principle. But it is entirely different to say, `But now we are going to use the tax system to subsidise these activities'. I have to say that there are circumstances under the Income Tax Assessment Act and other tax Acts where the tax system is used to subsidise certain activities. Sometimes that is appropriate. It is not something that ought to be done lightly but I do not say it should never be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems extraordinary that we are here contemplating a subsidy for environmental impact expenditures. We have two different situations. We have a situation where people are required to undertake this action. So it is a fair argument to say, `If the law requires them to do it, if they cannot proceed with the project unless they do this, it is an expense necessarily incurred in undertaking the project and that ought to be recognised by the tax Act'. That is one valid principle, which is why this is in the legislation. But it is entirely different to say, `We are going to subsidise you to do this, which the law requires you to do anyway'. That is quite different from saying, `There are some discretionary environmental expenditures which the tax system might encourage you to undertake'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can divert from income tax for a moment for the purpose of giving an example: some indirect subsidies are given through the sales tax legislation. If we want to encourage people to use recycled paper, if we want to encourage them to use solar heaters, we give some sales tax incentive. People can make a choice and we want to use in some way the tax system to influence their decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the situation we have before us today. We have a situation where the proposal would substantially subsidise environmental expenditures by giving considerable timing advantages in every case where the project to which the expenditure relates has a life longer than three years&mdash;which is almost every one. It seems to me entirely inappropriate and, in fact, quite puzzling that we are proposing to take that course of action. I want to counsel caution before we go down that road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same principle applies with regard to the debate about immediate write-off. The Bill writes off environmental impact expenditure for a project that is abandoned over 10 years&mdash;what is called the default write-off period. This avoids problems with the artificial abandonment of projects and perhaps their subsequent reinstatement, and limits the potential for supposed environmental expenditure that has a different character because the write-off is not immediate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson's proposal&mdash;and I am sure it is not his intention&mdash;seems to us to carry significant risk of abuse and would be likely to complicate the administration of the deduction by requiring reconsideration of particular cases as and when abandonment of the project is said to occur. I think there are two fundamental problems. It is inappropriate that we should be going down that road, and I urge the Opposition and the Democrats to reconsider that particular amendment. We are taking a significant step forward with the recognition of environmental impact expenditure and I do not believe we should go the next step, to the subsidy of that expenditure. It is not a subsidy that is going to encourage people to take any more environmentally conscious action because it is something that they are required to do. It is appropriate that we recognise it; it is inappropriate that we subsidise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McMullan for his response, but I ask the question: how can we hope to get this country going if there is not proper recognition of appropriate expenditure on investment? An environmental impact study is not a subsidy. It is somewhat similar to exploration; it is preparatory to the main work being carried out. In this very legislation before us tonight we have an acknowledgment of an extension of the deductibility regime in relation to preparatory exploration expenditure. Environmental impact statements are obligatory in most cases, or are certainly desirable, preparatory to undertaking the main investment. It is certainly not a subsidy. We must reject that notion out of hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the argument that has been presented, with due respect to Senator McMullan, runs counter to the proposals that have been put by his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and by his colleague Senator Button, both of whom are seeking to establish an income tax regime that will remove impediments so that Australian companies will not be at a disadvantage compared with other companies operating in the international environment. What we must do in this country is ensure that our tax regime matches the world's best. We are seeking by these amendments to match the world's best. Anything less&mdash;talk of a subsidy, talk of abuse of the system&mdash;I think falls short of that essential criterion; that is, lifting this country out of its stagnation, out of its recession and out of its depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way of doing that is to provide a proper recognition for the investment expenditures, particularly the long-term expenditures such as occur in the mining industry or in manufacturing. These are the two principal industries that would benefit from the amendments that have been proposed by the Opposition and have been, thankfully, supported by the Australian Democrats. Companies are not going to spend valuable dollars&mdash;and it often runs into millions of dollars&mdash;on environmental impact statements and then abuse that system. I fail to see that argument. It is true that it is a debating point, but this issue is more than a debate in this chamber. This is about real life situations and about getting investment going in this country. I think we have to look at this situation a little more seriously and look at the impact that the Government's proposal would have on industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is providing the opportunity, the enlightened way, to ease that burden and reduce the time pressures. At times of fairly high interest rates, high costs and unsatisfactory returns, we must improve the cost competitiveness of Australian business.

<PARA>These amendments propose two alterations to part 7 of the Bill. The first of these amendments introduces a time limit for the determination of taxation objections by the Commissioner of Taxation. The other amendment proposes a minor change to schedule 1 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act to ensure the continuation of existing rights to judicial review in respect of objection decisions. The amendments are not expected to have any impact on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment inserts proposed new section 14ZYA in division 3 of part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act. Honourable senators will be aware that at the hearing of the Finance and Public Administration Committee on this Bill Senator Watson proposed an amendment which would have allowed a taxpayer 60 days after objecting against an assessment to give notice to the Commissioner requiring the Commissioner to treat the objection as being disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Government does not have any difficulty with putting time constraints on the objection process, we consider that it would be more appropriate for the taxpayer to be required to put the Commissioner on notice that he is to determine the objection within a further specific time. The proposed new section specifies 60 days. At the expiry of this further 60-day period, the objection, if undetermined, will, as proposed by Senator Watson, be deemed to have been disallowed. This section will operate so that a person can give notice to the Commissioner 60 days after objecting or, if the Commissioner has asked for additional information in relation to the objection, 60 days after he has received that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will provide taxpayers with a degree of control over the objection process. At the same time, deemed disallowance of an objection will not change taxpayers' rights. The time limit and deemed disallowance mechanism will operate only where a person chooses to implement it by giving notice and the deemed objection decision will be subject to review in the same way as any other objection decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner has confirmed that this amendment will not affect the operation of the guidelines set out in income tax rulings IT-2569 and IT-2570 in connection with extensions of time for payment and the remission of additional tax for late payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 of the Bill contains amendments of certain Acts that are affected by the Bill's consolidation of objection, review and appeal provisions in the Taxation Administration Act. One of these amendments is to include a new paragraph (ga) in schedule 1 of the AD(JR) Act. This amendment was simply intended to ensure that decisions on taxation amendments that are currently outside the scope of judicial review under the AD(JR) Act would remain that way. However, at the Senate Committee hearing it was pointed out that the new paragraph may remove an existing right to review under that Act. To remove any doubt, the amendment being circulated modifies the proposed paragraph (ga) to ensure that existing rights are preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of technical matters were raised at the Committee hearing in relation to this part of the Bill. While amendments are not necessary, I should clarify two matters for the benefit of honourable senators. The first is that in the definition of `appealable objection decision' in proposed new section 14ZQ and in proposed new paragraph 14ZR(1)(a) there are references to section 14E of the Act. The section 14E there referred to is a proposed new section 14E being inserted by schedule 4 of the Bill. It does not refer to the previously repealed section 14E. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter refers to drafting technique. Honourable senators will notice that many of the provisions in proposed part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act refer to persons rather than taxpayers. This reflects the fact that the new provisions apply in relation to objections against taxation decisions of various kinds, for example, objections by employers to fringe benefits tax assessments and by companies to franking deficits tax offsets. While the new provisions could have exhaustively listed these expressions, it was considered that the term `person' was an adequate and appropriate term to cover all cases. </PARA>

I understood that Senator McMullan was going to give undertakings about Australian Taxation Office audit practice in collection procedures when there is an objection still in dispute with the Commission. He might recall that, when we put the original 60 days, we did indicate that this was essentially tight and was construed in such a way as to provide some degree of negotiation so far as the Government and the Tax Office vis-a-vis the taxpayer were concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government indicated that it would prefer not to have that in the Bill but that it was prepared to give a general indication that in most cases those two sets of circumstances would prevail. Would the Parliamentary Secretary clarify that, because on the basis that that undertaking would be given we did not pursue the issue further?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In handling this National Road Transport Commission Bill on behalf of the Opposition, let me declare that the manner in which this Government has chosen to deal with the road transport industry through the National Road Transport Commission and through this Bill is nothing short of shabby and disgraceful conduct. It is disgraceful, too, that its co-conspirators, the Australian Democrats, support this Bill without any hint of critical analysis of the current situation of the industry, the role to be played by the Commission or the procedures under which it will operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This farce, this waste of the Senate's time, with Labor and the Democrats combining to pass a Bill which is full of inadequacies and shortcomings, would not have occurred had the Democrats been more vigilant and more watchful of what this Government is attempting to do. This piece of legislation should not be before us today. We should not be wasting the Senate's time with a marred prescription for change. The Government has chosen to ignore totally the pleas of both the coalition and the industry for a more thorough and cogent evaluation of all aspects of the Road Transport Commission. Instead, the Government forges blindly ahead, despite the fact that it is clear that ongoing scrutiny of the Commission must take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pressure must be brought to bear on the legislation's architects, the soon to be in opposition Government, for its total disregard of vital industry needs. The Liberal and National parties cannot support this Bill in its present form or before the issues of total taxation on the industry and the efficiency of road construction and maintenance are given a full airing. The Bill chooses not to be concerned with these key problem areas faced by the road transport industry and, consequently, is fundamentally blemished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the issues highlighted by the Liberal and National parties in opposition, and subsequently emphasised by the industry, are disregarded and major areas of concern ignored, the industry will be set back 20 years. If a thorough review of the taxation paid by the industry and a removal of the tax burden on inputs are included as two of the basic requirements currently ignored by the legislation, then and only then could the Opposition consider giving support to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, has been cooing recently about winning so-called concessions from the Government to ensure that the proposed road charges for heavy vehicles are fair and equitable and that there will be increased parliamentary oversight of road transport reform. But there is currently no provision for determining what is fair and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter's claims that the real concerns of rural communities and the trucking industry will be properly addressed, without derailing the long overdue development of uniform national road transport laws, are pathetic and unsustainable excuses for ignoring the industry's concerns. To date, neither the Government nor the Democrats have shown genuine concern for the level of input taxes and charges already paid by the road transport industry or, for that matter, the current efficiency levels of road construction and maintenance so that recommendations for efficiency improvements might be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad truth of the matter is that the Democrats could not even get their act together to consider what this Bill will do to the road transport industry. They certainly could not even muster up enough enthusiasm for their representative on the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure to attend last week's special hearings on this Bill where numerous road transport industry representatives from across Australia took the time to appear and to voice their frustrations and concerns on issues that they fear will be ignored in this legislation and, ultimately also, one suspects, by the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' choice to demean and not recognise industry distress regarding this legislation may ultimately hijack the road transport industry and cause irreparable damage to it and to all those who benefit in some way from it. The Democrats will never live down the fact that they gave this failed Hawke Labor Government carte blanche support on the legislation without even bothering to hear the concerns of the industry. The Democrats refused to support the initiative of the Liberal and National parties for a wide-ranging inquiry into the issues affecting the transport industry before this Bill was given further consideration. They then failed to turn up to hear the evidence presented to the legislation committee hearing last Wednesday, as already detailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this, they were almost matched by the Labor Party which, through most of the hearing, was represented only by the Committee Chairman, with one other member appearing briefly at the beginning of the hearing, another appearing intermittently but briefly during the evening, and one not appearing at all. Only the three Liberal members&mdash;Senators Panizza, Macdonald and I, as Deputy Chairman&mdash;plus Senator Boswell of the National Party, by invitation, and the Labor Chairman heard the comprehensive and distressing evidence that was given to us about the detrimental impact of the Government's legislation. As a consequence, at the conclusion of the Committee hearing we three Liberals, in the absence of sufficient Labor and Democrat Committee members, were able to have the following resolution passed at the conclusion of the hearing last Wednesday night:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Committee recommends that the Senate not proceed with the National Road Transport Commission Bill, because of the failure of the Government to adequately answer questions raised in evidence before the Committee as to the impact of the legislation, unless and until the Interim National Road Transport Commission examines and publicly reports on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.the economic and social impact of full cost recovery of road costs on rural and regional Australia;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Committee has had the opportunity to consider the Interim Commission's Report.</PARA>
<PARA>Today, at a hastily convened meeting, again in the absence of the Democrats, the Government was able to use its full quota of numbers on the Committee to overturn this recommendation and have the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure recommend that the Bill proceed. That is why Senators Panizza, Macdonald and I have lodged a dissenting report in the following terms:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence given in the brief time spent on the inquiry, which cannot as yet be actually analysed&mdash;confirms to us the belief that a comprehensive inquiry must be held before proceeding with legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats should be standing with us and denying passage to this Bill until the issues are resolved. The resolution of the Senate earlier today for a full scale inquiry into the issues, sponsored by the Democrats, even though it incorporates the Opposition amendment to include investigating all taxation on the industry, is a meaningless sop to the industry after the Democrats have sold it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough to have a Senate committee inquiry after the legislation has passed, as the Democrats have now indicated. As proposed by the Opposition, passage of the legislation should have been delayed until this detailed inquiry occurred. The legislation is yet further evidence of how disdainfully this leaderless Government addresses the industry's numerous and deep-seated problems which have been caused by the mismanagement and neglect of micro-economic reform issues crucial to the road transport industry's survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in one of his regular mega-announcements, made following the so-called most important Special Premiers Conference since the war, trumpeted the setting up of the new Road Transport <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Commission. Mr Hawke informed us that the Commission would be established to assist with new regulations and registration and charging arrangements and that an interim commission would be in place by September. Is Mr Hawke really serious about these massive changes to the road transport industry?  This is a valid question when one remembers that the July agreement foreshadowed the interim commission's appointment in September, three months ago, but that it was actually appointed only late last month&mdash;a mere couple of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim commission is to report on the registration charges by March 1992; a job initially set to take six months. It now seems it will only take two, because by the time the Commission gets rolling after the summer break, and following its delayed establishment, it will still have to report by March. If this is an indication of the depth of the Prime Minister's commitment to the reformation of the road transport industry and its more than 400,000 workers, it is also an indication of the gross lack of sincerity displayed by both this Government and the supporters of this legislation, the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Prime Minister may have been in one of his caring, sharing, supportive moods when he announced the setting up of the Road Transport Commission but, from the outset, the issue of poor timing has cast suspicion on the entire process. The road transport industry is extremely concerned at the direction in which the Government wants to take the industry. It, quite rightly, wants some focus on the Government's unwillingness to negotiate changes to its methodology and its reluctance to disclose how the new charges will be derived and, in fact, what they will be. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) says this piece of legislation is merely a mechanical Bill; a straightforward and non-controversial piece of legislation which merely sets up the organisation. Yet it cannot even get that started on time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission Bill 1991 will essentially set in place the framework under which the Commission will operate. The Commission will then be required to investigate and make recommendations to the Australian Transport Advisory Council regarding the establishment of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme and the introduction of nationally consistent heavy vehicle regulations and charging procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, within and across the industry there is major disquiet with the direction of, and the methodology to be used by, the Commission. Last Wednesday, the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure hearing on the legislation heard, loud and clear, the worry and dissatisfaction among industry members who are concerned with the intended operation of the Commission and the Commission's failure to consult, as was promised, with key industry players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road transport industry is probably the most competitive in Australia. All forms of economic restrictions were lifted as long ago as the 1950s. This factor has assisted industry to achieve efficiencies. The industry needs other reforms&mdash;not just in the business of road transport but in the areas of roads, regulations and taxes as well. Road transport carries about 80 per cent of the freight task of this country and employs about 400,000 people. So the pricing of road transport affects millions of customers and consumers across our entire community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the Commission provides both fair and open processes which achieve the best outcome for and satisfy the interests of the whole community, the following five factors must be considered: firstly, the Commission, following its investigations and deliberations, must be given enough time to report; secondly, the Commission must adjust its methodology to take into account alternative and even opposing views relating to how it operates; thirdly, since the Inter-State Commission's report on the excessive levels of taxation imposed on the road transport industry have become legend, they should be thoroughly investigated&mdash;and the road transport industry is already taxed 3 1/2 times more in indirect taxes than the average for all other industries; fourthly, the Commission must be able to determine appropriate cost recovery targets independently; and, finally, the Commission must be provided with the capacity to look at appropriate timing to move to full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is easy to see why the industry is both alarmed and concerned at the direction which this legislation appears to be taking. The National Road Transport Commission has clearly not been given sufficiently wide reference powers to consider the existing taxes that road transport pays, because the new charges will be over and above the existing taxes. This is guaranteed to send many operators and their employees out of business. The Inter-State Commission, not the Road Transport Authority, has already advised that the road transport industry does more than pay its way with taxes and charges. Industry members have also expressed concern that all the beneficial aspects of the proposed reform, specifically uniform rules and regulations, have been sacrificed in the name of political compromise. The zonal system plus the ability of any State to make an application order for variation implies that standards enforcement levels and penalties may not be uniform at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not address the charging and regulatory regime directly, but it does hint that the major role of the Commission will be a facade behind which the State road transport authorities will continue business as usual. Further, it has not been given the power to scrutinise the supply of roads, and there is ample evidence that road construction and maintenance are inefficient. This is an area where significant savings could be achieved if the issue were addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There will, apparently, be some 21 committees whose work bears directly on the Commission, and one does not have to be a mathematician to work out the amount of time such a workload will impose on Commission members. These and other important aspects of the operation of the Commission in particular, and the legislation generally, are fundamental to the operation of the road transport industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While the coalition agrees with the principle of a commission as a means to achieve a more rational approach to road transport and road funding, it cannot give its support to the current structure of this Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Road Transport Commission Bill seeks to establish a National Road Transport Commission and set in place a framework under which it will operate. Frankly, I do not like its chances of success. I believe that the Bill is absolutely doomed from the start because, as we on this side of the chamber keep saying time and time again on Bill after Bill, the legislation is flawed, it is sloppy and it does not address the very real concerns of the industry to which it applies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the Government operates in a vacuum. At a time when ABARE is predicting a massive 75 per cent slump in farm incomes and unemployment is at a national level of 10.5 per cent, rising to as much as 40 per cent and 50 per cent in some areas among some age groups, what is occupying the Government's mind? The incessant squabbling, of course, about who should or should not lead the Australian Labor Party into oblivion. I personally do not care who leads the Labor Party, but the way Labor is going it will not only be the Labor Party which fades into oblivion but all of Australia. While the Government is so preoccupied with factions and fist fights, the Government is pushing through legislation which is flawed, which is wrong and which is not in the very best interests of the industry. There is a public funding commitment in this. We are told that it will cost the Federal Government some $3m to $4m a year, or 35 per cent of the total costs. We are spending even more funds from beleaguered taxpayers on something that no-one seems to want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation, as we know, was referred to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. During that Committee's deliberations, Senator Chapman moved:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Committee recommends that the Senate not proceed with the National Road Transport Commission Bill, because of the failure of the Government to adequately answer questions raised in evidence before the Committee as to the impact of the legislation, unless and until the Interim National Road Transport Commission examines and publicly reports on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.the economic and social impact of full cost recovery of road costs on rural and regional Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.all input taxes and charges paid by the road transport industry;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.the likely level of Road Charges and Road Use Charges on various operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Committee has had time to consider the Interim Commission's Report.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Macdonald and Senator Panizza supported the motion, with Senators Foreman and Faulkner dissenting. The motion was agreed to. The Committee report sums up very clearly what should be happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry representatives, including Mr Ron Seach from Gunnedah, met with the Committee last week in Canberra. He and others put a range of arguments to the Committee and expressed real concerns about how the commission would levy road charges. Ron Seach, a partner in Goodman and Seach, at Curlewis, told the Committee that as his business is an intrastate business his vehicles never leave New South Wales and under the two-zone system proposed it would be locked into a high cost regime. He pointed out that, as he was not a national operator, he would not be able to offset his costs by moving between high and low cost zones as large national fleet operators would be able to do. He pointed out that it was not just the trucking companies which would be affected but those companies whose goods they carry. His business carries black coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Ron Seach pointed out, the very last thing that the New South Wales coal industry needs at the present time is more legislative disadvantage such as this Bill would create. He put the view that, if all Australians benefit from an efficient and viable road system, surely all Australians should contribute to it. The NFF is also opposed to the legislation. At the Committee hearing Gary Goucher, from the NFF, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The farm sector is quite concerned at the progress that is being made in efforts to rationalise the road transport arrangements in Australia. Whilst the objectives certainly sound laudable, the constraints which are being put on the process, essentially by the structure of the agreement between the Premiers and the Commonwealth, do not permit the reforms to get to an end point that is going to be in the interests of improving Australia's position and that of its industries. It does have a risk of in fact making Australia worse off.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Government should think about that statement as it is pushing through this legislation. Mr Goucher further suggested that under the Bill the Government would be shifting a tax burden from one group of taxpayers to another. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a significant extent, you are going to shift that tax burden onto export industries, of which agriculture is a major one. I know for a fact that that particular industry has no capacity to accept additional charges and suggest that Australia as a whole has no capacity to be thinking about putting additional charges on its export industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, those are two points that really should be taken into account. The NFF was also concerned about the powers, responsibilities and independence of the Commission. Even the Transport Workers Union has concerns. It complained about lack of consultation&mdash;which seems a little strange, given the union movement's traditional closeness to and control over the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Road transport is the lifeblood of any country town, every country business. Any charges that affect freight make life in non-metropolitan New South Wales, or any part of Australia outside the major metropolitan areas, that much less affordable. The Government has yet again forgotten the impact that this legislation will have on rural people. We today saw the situation the rural sector is in. We only have to look at the front page of this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> to see the plight of the people in rural areas. They are literally at a one-minute-to-midnight crisis point. No government has any right to contemplate legislation that will increase charges for rural dwellers by even as much as one cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the Opposition's amendment moved by Senator Chapman, which addresses the anomalies in this Bill. The legislation is flawed; it is sloppy; and it is inflationary. The Government needs to go back to the drawing board and do something about it. It needs to come up with a Bill that is a lot better than the one which has been presented to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The function of the National Road Transport Commission Bill is to establish a National Road Transport Commission. The Bill will bring into effect an inter-governmental agreement that was signed on 30 July by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premiers and Chief Ministers of all the States and Territories. The proposed Commission is to develop national legislation on road use charges. Of course, the Bill will provide the framework for the National Road Transport Commission. The legislation will be developed by the Commission, and any changes will be dealt with in separate legislation. Of course, it deals only with vehicles over 4 1/2 tonnes. Let no-one forget that the Premiers Conference is still considering what to do with lighter vehicles, those under 4 1/2 tonnes, so they are not quite out of the net yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is a nonsense at this stage. The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure would probably agree that it has been brought before the Senate at this late stage with narrow reporting from the Committee due to the narrow guidelines it had to work with when investigating the charges. It is essentially a taxing Bill and a revenue raising piece of legislation. While it does not affect current legislation or charges, it provides the interim arrangements. I have already said that the first set of charges is to be determined and recommended by March 1992 and then implemented in January 1993. So I cannot really see what the hurry is. For some unknown reason, that is what the Government wants to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Government wants to get those charges up, not recognising at all what road transport is already paying. There is an admission by everyone around the country that they are paying 3 1/2 times more tax than anyone else. But here we have the Government wanting to set charges for full road construction and maintenance cost recovery by March, to be implemented in the next year. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transport has a pervasive influence over the efficiency of our economy and improvements in the system will have significant national benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry Commission has estimated that a more efficient land transport system, including a more efficient rail system, alone could realise an additional $6 billion in Gross Domestic Profit every year.</PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government is committed to a competitive and efficient transport system. Cheaper and more efficient transport means greater success in ensuring Australia's industries are more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are very worthwhile words, but the Bill does not provide for cheaper transport; in fact, it provides for more expensive transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill focuses only on the charges. It concentrates on raising costs, not on achieving savings. It fails to achieve any micro-economic reform objectives and provides no recognition of community service obligations. That is a point that was brought out very strongly at our Committee the other night by those of us on this side of the chamber. The proposal does not recognise any government community service obligations to provide roads for less return than the full cost of supplying them in developing Australia. Community service obligations should be taken into account when it is in the national interest to provide roads to rural and remote areas for the purpose of defence and economic development, particularly for major export industries such as mining, primary production and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has gone back on the undertaking which Senator Evans provided in 1988 that the cost of production would not be reflected in registration charges. I suppose that the Government is relying on an action in the High Court about that time that gave it some hope to get out of Senator Evans's undertaking at the Yass blockade in 1998, which I will not go into at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to the issue of the CSOs for one moment. The roads provided in Australia, which the registration charges will reflect, are not wholly or totally used by members of the heavy transport system&mdash;in fact, some roads are never used by them&mdash;yet they are taken into consideration for setting those charges. Tourist roads seldom see a heavy vehicle. Tourist places in remote areas especially are serviced by light vehicles. So how can the Government say that the cost of those roads will be reflected? Defence roads are another example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position has been well pointed out by Senator Chapman and by my colleague Senator Brownhill. No doubt Senator Macdonald will back up these honourable senators later. I would like to reinforce what the coalition believes. I believe that we need an inquiry into the social and regional impact of the price increases on rural and remote Australia to report before the Bill is legislated for and a thorough summary is made of the taxation already paid. I have already mentioned that road users are paying three and a half times more in charges than anyone else and yet no-one, especially the Australian Democrats, was interested enough in the inquiry last week to turn up. Senator Kernot had better not interject because I have an answer for her. Further, we want an inquiry into road costs and the efficiency of making those roads in Australia. Given the deadline in setting the registration fees by 1992, I cannot see how this new Commission has a snowball's chance in hell of ever achieving cost recovery by March 1992, especially since, as I have already said, it will not be set up until January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of various discussions held on this proposed Bill, it has been decided that we will have a zonal system. I welcome the zonal system when talking about Western Australia and probably Queensland because there will be a discount on the charges; I do not quite know what they will be. However, it will provide more problems than it will solve because basing it on the State borders is strictly illogical. If it was based right around the coast of Australia where most of the population lives, I would agree with it. But it is being based on State borders. I seldom defend New South Wales, but the western part of that State is as remote an area in Australia as one can get. South Australia, which is not yet part of the system, has the same problem. Western Australia is in zone B and thus has lower charges. The working of the system is utterly impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When questioning representatives of the Department at the Committee inquiry the other day, I asked what the situation would be if a truck travelled from Perth in Western Australia right across South Australia and into Broken Hill, which is only a few kilometres inside New South Wales. Would the journey be split up into the lower zone and the higher zone? I was told by them&mdash;it is a pity we do not have some departmental people here tonight to listen to what is going on so they can advise us later&mdash;that if a vehicle or a vehicle with a trailer travels into the other zone, zone A, at all, then higher charges will have to be registered there. That is exactly what I was told the other night. I hope I am wrong, but that is what I was told. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been pointed out by Senator Chapman, this Bill was referred to a committee last week. We, on this side of the chamber, had attempted to send it to the same Committee and have it report back in the middle of next year, or give it whatever time was needed in order to cover the points that we have discussed already. I will run through them again briefly. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Committee hearing last week our side moved a motion which was carried. It involved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the economic and social impact of full cost recovery of road costs on rural and regional Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">all input taxes and charges paid by the road transport industry:</PARA>
<PARA>That was the main thing: we wanted to find out what they were before we started setting new ones. The motion continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the likely level of Road Charges and Road Use Charges on various operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Committee has had time to consider the Interim Commission's Report. That was what we were looking for. That motion was passed and, contrary to any other debates, regulations or resolutions, it was overturned in another place in three minutes when the Chairman called another meeting in order to overturn it. I thought one had to give at least 14 days notice of the intention to rescind a motion before one could move another motion, but obviously that does not work in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That meeting consisted of us and the Government. The timing of the meeting was changed about three or four times. In the five days notice that was given to the road transport industry of Australia, some people came to Canberra to appear in front of the Committee on a Wednesday evening. The Committee sat from 8 o'clock until 2 o'clock in the morning&mdash;which shows how dedicated these people were. These people included: Mr G. Boulton of the National Freight Forwarders Association; the Hon. F. Finch, the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works; Mr B. Fletcher of Fletchers Freighters; Mr G. Gouche of the National Farmers Federation, and the National Farmers Federation represents all the farmers federations around Australia, as well as the pastoralists and graziers; Mr R. Gunning and Mr B. McIver of the Road Transport Forum; Mr J. McLean of the New South Wales Branch of the Transport Workers Union of Australia; Mr J. Pearson of the Long Distance Road Transport Association; and Mr R. Seach of Goodman and Seach. Submissions were received from L. Arthur Smith Pty Ltd, BHP Transport, the Northern Territory Government, the National Freight Forwarders Association and the Victorian Road Transport Association Inc. That is the calibre of the submissions received and of the people who appeared before us for six hours that night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very saddened that the Australian Democrats, who receive at least one-third of their votes from the rural areas of Australia, did not make the effort to attend. No-one can tell me that they did not know that the meeting was being held. They chose to ignore it; just as they chose to ignore the meeting we had today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone is disputing the fact that the Australian Democrats chose to ignore this meeting, I will read out part of a release or a statement that came from Senator Coulter, the Leader of the Democrats. This is his statement to witnesses and observers who showed up on that night. The Australian Democrats did not have the decency to send one of their representatives, so they sent a statement. So let them not deny that they had knowledge of this meeting. The statement read in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret that the Australian Democrats are unable to attend tonight's meeting. Our Transport spokesperson, Senator Janet Powell, is on compassionate leave;&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I sympathise with her&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be handling the Bill in her place, but prior engagements and the short notice of this meeting prevent me from attending.</PARA>
<PARA>Five days is given as being too short a period of notice for someone who is here in the Parliament. Yet look at the list of witnesses I have cited as coming from all parts of Australia in order to attend this very important meeting. Once again, let not the Democrats say that they did not know about this meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Committee reinforced my concerns as to what were the problems with this Bill and as to the charges it would be likely to set up without reflecting on what is being paid around Australia already. It reaffirmed my conviction that this Bill, without its going any further, should be under the scrutiny of a committee sent to gather evidence from all around Australia to determine what the impacts would be, because we certainly do not know half of what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Bill has come back into the Senate for processing, after the overturning of our motion at the meeting this morning. So Senator Chapman, Senator Macdonald and I have put in a dissenting report, which is published in this publication for everyone in the Senate to read. That is the position we have arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate or the Government has any idea of enacting such a Bill to start setting charges before looking at other things, it would be totally wrong. We have to look at other things too. We have to look at how independent this proposed Commission will be. The Bill sets up a Commission that I believe would in no way be independent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, but I cannot hear Senator Kernot. But the point is</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>that the Commission cannot be independent with those sorts of guidelines. Where is the real reform that has been made by this Government?  In a statement that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made in 1983, he told how this Government was going to reform transport, roads and rail. Where is the reform that has been made?  I cannot see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that, before we even look at charges and reflect on the cost of building roads, we would look in Australia to see whether we are efficiently building roads. Anyone who drives along main roads, as I do, and cares to look at the road-making gangs will see that there are umpteen pieces of plant sitting there&mdash;graders, loaders, come what may. What hours do they work?  They are employed for 35 hours a week if we are lucky. Those machines could be working not 24 hours a day, which I think could be quite dangerous on main roads, but 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and be two or three times as productive. Nothing has been done about that. Outdated plant is being used as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the main thing that we could be looking at is contracting out, going out to tender and letting the main roads department in each State submit tenders. We could then see whether the departments got the jobs. If the departments got the jobs themselves as the result of a real tender, I would say that they could be efficient. But I think that, in the first instance, most of those jobs let out on tender would go out to private contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have to look at engineering. We had submissions in here some time ago from road construction people&mdash;asphalt suppliers&mdash;that the education amongst the more remote shires and makers of roads is lacking. There should be measures such as interchange among engineers to give them experience in those outer areas. We have to look at all those things, and we have to rationalise road making resources and road funds so that the money that we are spending goes much further when we come to road making. Then when all those things are in place&mdash;when we have the most efficient road making and the most up-to-date methods&mdash;we have to establish something that I have not mentioned, that is, a designated route system for heavy transport in Australia. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a designated plan for all of Australia, we can rationalise our resources and spend them on those roads and not on the ones that are not quite so important. They are the things we have to do before we start looking at setting new charges that may put a lot of road operators in Australia out of action and, indeed, the rural and remote areas out of business in other ways.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It introduces a series of changes to the operation of Comcare and the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a separation of the Commission's regulatory and service functions with the new Commission responsible for regulatory functions including determining and setting premiums, occupational health and safety, licensing of self-administrators, and the Chief Executive Officer responsible for Comcare's commercial and service operations</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a restructuring of the Commission to broaden its expertise</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are not the only amendments the Government proposes to make as a result of the Brown Review. However, by introducing these as a first step and putting the new Commission in place, I will be able to draw on its advice in implementing other important recommendations of the Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the staged approach further legislative amendments will be introduced in the Autumn Sittings covering:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.licensing of self-administering authorities</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.improved financial arrangements to enable Comcare's financial statements to show that the scheme is fully funded, which will establish a basis for consideration of the need for any further moves towards self-financing of Comcare operations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comcare will introduce more flexible operating arrangements involving the expansion of the range of services available to Commonwealth employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government will give consideration to the ability of Comcare to offer its services to recently privatised Government Business Enterprises and to the diversification of Comcare's market base outside the Commonwealth public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Brown Review made a number of recommendations relating to the commercialisation of Comcare. The Government will consider these recommendations next year after the full policy and financial implications have been examined. I wish to reiterate the Government's intention to further reform the Commonwealth's workers' compensation system, in the broad directions recommended by Ron Brown in his Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SELF-ADMINISTRATORS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I propose to introduce further amendments to the CERC Act in the Autumn Session which will deal specifically with the issue of self-administrators. When the CERC Act was passed in 1988 provision was made for both Australia Post and Telecom to become self-administrators of the Commonwealth workers' compensation scheme, for a two year trial period, with responsibility for all aspects of the administration of the CERC Act for their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill empowers the Commission to ensure that, as far as practicable, there is no inconsistency in the administrative practices and procedures used by Comcare and the self-administering authorities in the performance of their respective functions. The Commission will be able to prepare and issue general policy guidelines to the principal officer of an administering authority in relation to the operation of the Act, to the extent that the Act confers functions or powers on the authority. The administering authority must comply with any guidelines issued by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a matter of priority I will be asking the Commission to develop guidelines for a number of administrative practices including:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Time limits for determinations and reviews</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Surveillance practices</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.The current practice of using medical review panels</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Procedures for review of disputed claims</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of some remaining confusion about the status of decisions and recommendations made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal I will also ask the Commission to consider this issue as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime I have asked the current Commission to resolve these issues in consultation with the self-administrators. I will also give an undertaking that the performance of the self-administrators in these areas will be taken into account in determining whether they are granted licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also provide for the current self-administration arrangements to be replaced with two licences&mdash;self-insurance and in-house claims management as recommended by the Brown Review. Both licences would be subject to strict entry thresholds and periodic review. At this stage the Government is not proposing to extend licences for claims management to other statutory authorities or departments, until the new licensing arrangements have been reviewed by the new Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In foreshadowing these amendments to the CERC Act it is the Government's intention to give the Commission the power to develop licensing arrangements and to require any conditions it sees fit, but as a minimum set of criteria:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Commission would have the power to grant or refuse applications for either or both forms of licence;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Commission will have regard to the suitability of the applicant, the applicant's financial ability to meet current and future liabilities, and the ability of the applicant to meet claims management and rehabilitation standards set by the Commission;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Commission will set performance standards including time limits for determinations and reviews, issue guidelines on the administration of the Act to promote consistency in its administration, monitor performance and report annually on the performance of the licensees and on other matters relating to the licensing system;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A licence would be granted subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in the legislation and as imposed by the Commission;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Commission will be empowered to suspend or revoke a licence if the conditions of the licence are not complied with; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.All liabilities incurred by a licensee during the period of the licence would remain with the licensee following cancellation or suspension of a licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REDEMPTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Brown Review recommended that a special arrangement should be made to redeem the entitlements of some of those beneficiaries affected by the special transitional arrangements in the 1988 legislation. The Government recognises the need to consider the special circumstances of those claimants who have been most adversely affected by these arrangements, taking into account questions of equity. Therefore, we will consider, in the context of 1992/93 Budget, a proposal for a special redemptions arrangement having regard to all factors including equity consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SERVICE ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Brown Review drew attention to a number of important service issues identified in submissions to the review and recommended that they be given early attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new arrangements proposed in this legislation which establish Comcare as the body responsible for commercial and service operations, I have asked the Chief Executive Officer of Comcare to prepare a service plan for the consideration of the Commission before the end of June 1992 at the latest. This will address the key service issues identified in the Review and establish service standards and an implementation strategy for the organisation. A report on the development and implementation of the Service Plan will be included in Comcare's Annual Report for 1991/92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TABLING OF BROWN REPORT</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>As the Senate will recall, the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Democrats combined to put to this chamber a second reading amendment on this legislation when it was debated last Thursday. The effect of that second reading amendment would have been to throw out the legislation at the second reading stage with an instruction to the Government to redraft it more closely in accordance with the recommendations of the Brown report and then bring that legislation back. As the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has already indicated, he sought an adjournment of the debate at that stage to engage in discussions and negotiations with both the Liberal Party and the Democrats with regard to our concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday we granted the Minister's request. The concerns which the Opposition in particular had with regard to the legislation were, firstly, and perhaps most importantly, that it largely ignored, as we saw it, the recommendations of the Brown report; secondly, that the Minister had failed to table the Brown report in the Parliament; and, thirdly, the Minister had not explained why the legislation did not incorporate the 15 recommendations of the Brown report or why he had not tabled the report. In fact, we regarded that in particular as unacceptable, but all three of those concerns were unacceptable to the Opposition. We regarded the Minister's second reading speech as a travesty in terms of its lack of content and information with regard to the Government's response to the Brown recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore welcome the Minister's statement tonight, which spells out in much greater detail the intent of the Government with regard to the Brown report and to future legislation which the Minister has promised to introduce in the autumn session of this Parliament. In the spirit of cooperation that we have tried to adopt over the last few days in discussions and negotiations with the Minister, I accept that statement in good faith that, in the autumn session, further legislation will be introduced and will proceed further down the track of implementing the Brown recommendations. However, we will seek to move an amendment in the committee stage of this Bill with regard to the structure of the National Road Transport Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although welcoming the Minister's cooperation in issuing this further detailed statement, I regret that the Opposition, with the support of the Democrats, had to threaten rejection of this Bill before we could get his attention directed to these issues. I regret that, in a sense, I had to help so much in drafting his statement tonight by looking at successive drafts of it and suggesting issues that ought to be addressed in that statement which were of concern to the Opposition. I believe the issues are sufficiently clear that the Minister should have seen them and given expression to them himself without any prompting by the Opposition. I also regret the evident slack administration of Comcare that has required the Opposition to bring this pressure to bear, which is highlighted in the Brown report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn briefly to the Minister's statement. I particularly welcome his opening sentence, which includes a recognition of the merits of commercialisation. The Opposition certainly believes that commercialisation must become an inherent part of Comcare and it must head down that track. I welcome the fact that, under the heading `The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1991' he made the first dot point a separation of the Commission's regulatory and service functions. Again, we believe that is of extreme importance and is of particular relevance to the commercialisation of Comcare. On the first page of the statement the Minister refers to improved financial arrangements to enable Comcare's financial statements to show that the scheme is fully funded, which will establish a basis for consideration of the need for any further moves towards self-financing Comcare's operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this is a very important issue. One of the major recommendations of the Brown report was that Comcare should become self-funding in its operation. It is perhaps worth referring to the Brown report with regard to that matter. The report identified a major weakness in the current scheme&mdash;one which it acknowledged Comcare has no control over&mdash;that is, the method in which premiums were paid to Consolidated Revenue and no separate accounting made for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brown report made the point that funds to cover the emerging cost of the liability are advanced annually to Comcare, as are funds for the administration of the scheme. The report went on to highlight a number of problems with this arrangement, the most significant of which was that by allowing the premiums to be absorbed into Consolidated Revenue, and making no clear provision for the accumulation of funds to cover liabilities under the scheme, the Government was operating a pay-as-you-go scheme rather than a fully funded system. This is contrary to the clear intention when Comcare was established several years ago. As the report says, it has been demonstrated in recent years to be a very unsound practice in the area of workers' compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence given to the review, the Department of Finance put forward reasons why such a situation should continue. However, the Brown report makes it very clear that it regards the arguments of the Department of Finance as inadequate and unsustainable. It is on that basis that we believe that Comcare should proceed to be a fully funded organisation. In particular, we would want to see Comcare operate on the basis of a self-financing organisation which includes both receiving and investing all premium income from the scheme and financing all Comcare operations out of investment income. I trust that, as the Government proceeds down the path of commercialisation, that is the course it will follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue about which we have concern is that of the transitional arrangements for certain recipients of Comcare benefits. Again, the Brown report highlights the fact that some people have suffered relative hardship as a result of those transitional arrangements. It indicated that it might be more satisfactory if those people were able to quit the scheme altogether under a mutually acceptable arrangement. There were recommendations in the Brown report with regard to lump sum payments being made to cover those people. Again, this is an issue which has not been picked up in the legislation. We regret that. However, I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated in his statement that this is a matter to which the Government will give consideration in the context of the Budget for the next financial year. The Opposition would urge the Government to give very serious consideration to that issue and come forward with a program in the forthcoming Budget for lump sum redemptions of people who have suffered as a result of those transitional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the Brown report commenced its investigation some 12 months ago in December 1990. Comcare provided support staff for that inquiry. Throughout the Brown inquiry&mdash;it was conducted between December and April when the report was given to the Minister&mdash;Comcare was very much aware of the issues that were being raised and the progress that was being made towards conclusions and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our belief that the Government and Comcare have had more than ample time to address and act on the issues that were raised by Brown, yet we are really only now seeing the commencement of those issues being addressed, some eight months after the report was presented to the Minister and 12 months after the inquiry commenced. We regard that delay as entirely unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, already one Budget has been missed to implement any financial implications of the recommendations of the Brown inquiry that might be applied. We are now told that it will take until June 1992 for Comcare to prepare a plan on service issues that were raised in the Brown report. That may well raise the danger that some of these issues are not addressed even in the next Budget. I urge that those service issues be addressed and recommendations made to the Minister in time for account to be taken of them in the next Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I believe there has been ample time for the issues raised by Brown to have been considered by the Government and by Comcare. I believe it is slackness on the part of the Government and on the part of Comcare that they have not been addressed as yet. I also believe it is slackness that, despite this report being handed down in April, it was only two weeks ago that we were presented with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, as the Senate sittings reach their conclusion, we particularly wanted to move amendments which addressed the relationship between the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the administration of Comcare issues. In particular, we believe there should be the opportunity for people to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal concurrently with their application to Comcare or the administering authority for a determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not been able to proceed with that amendment, despite the fact that the Minister has indicated to us that the Government has no immediate opposition to that proposal, but because the Minister would not have the opportunity tonight to obtain expert advice as to its implications for the legislation overall. This, again, is one of the recommendations that came forward, yet the Minister says at the twelfth hour that he does not have the opportunity to obtain expert advice on it. The same applies to other amendments which we would have sought to move in the committee stage of this legislation. We regard that as particularly unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been assured by the Minister that one of our other concerns&mdash;that the chief executive officer of Comcare will not be the chairman of the Commission&mdash;is addressed in the legislation and in his statement, and that the part time chairman will not be the chief executive officer. We are satisfied with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have some concern that Government authorities other than Comcare which make determinations with regard to compensation under this legislation will remain the bodies which hear appeals for reconsideration of their initial determinations. We have had presented to us information that those bodies do not have the expertise adequately to make a fair reconsideration of those issues. Our view was that reconsideration should have been referred back to Comcare for further determination. Again, we are precluded from proceeding with that amendment because of the lateness of our receipt of, and dealing with, this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having expressed those concerns, I conclude by saying that generally we support the additional statement which the Minister has presented tonight. We look forward to the next stage of the legislation&mdash;the next Bill being presented in the autumn session, introducing far more of the recommendations of the Brown report, and those which we want to see implemented&mdash;and we will certainly await that with interest. On that basis, we will not oppose this Bill at the second reading stage, but we will be moving one amendment at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As was indicated by Senator Chapman and also by Minister Cook, I believe there has been a considerable amount of negotiation on what we have before us. In fact, that negotiation has brought us to a position of compromise, if not consensus. So little needs to be added that has not been said in that negotiation process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a ministerial statement before us. The assurances given in that statement are in many ways commendable and will be received with considerable relief by the aggrieved parties who have been expressing their concern about the administration of workers compensation by the described self-administering authorities, Telecom Australia and Australia Post. A litany of disputed decisions by these authorities has provoked the passionate concerns being expressed to us, the Australian Democrats, and the Opposition, in the hope that when the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) was presented to us it would assist in resolving the concerns of the aggrieved parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not blame these people for making their grievances known. Upon seeing a Bill which was called the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, many people would not be aware that such a Bill would promise to resolve the many problems they have experienced in trying to have what they thought were their just concerns about workers compensation claims met. When it became apparent that this so-titled Bill promised to institute some of the recommendations of the review of the Comcare program, known as the Brown review, people wanted to see many more of those recommendations implemented immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now assured in the ministerial statement that this Bill is the vehicle for establishing a much more efficient system for the administration of the workers compensation arrangements and that in future, in the autumn session, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) will be moving to use that vehicle to bring about a considerable number of changes. It is the nature of those changes that has been the subject of much of our discussion in the past few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I spoke earlier in the second reading debate on the Bill I did raise a couple of examples of the sorts of concerns that had been expressed by people who had suffered from what could only be described as poor decision-making. The situation which brought about the examples I gave at that time has not changed. In fact, since giving those examples many others have been brought to our attention. It was surprising to find that these examples of poor decision-making really existed in the current Act, the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. It was surprising to find section 69F stating that the Commission has functions which include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to maintain contact with each administering authority and rehabilitation authority to the extent necessary to ensure that, as far as practicable, there is no inconsistency in the administrative practices and procedures used by the Commission and the authority in the performance of their respective functions;</PARA>
<PARA>It was patently obvious that inconsistencies had developed between what was practised by Telecom and Australia Post and what was practised by Comcare. Those inconsistencies led to poor decisions. It was surprising that it seemed there was the capacity within the existing Act to address those inconsistencies and to consider them, but that was not done. We are now told that we need a new Act and a new system to provide the capacity to do something about that inconsistency. We are told that will be done through the licensing provisions that will be instituted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only hope that that is so. I honestly believe, from reading the Minister's statement, that it will be so. But it is not so now, and it appears that there are no teeth in this legislation. I plead with the Minister to ensure that the promises made in the statement are fulfilled in the proposed legislation. I have no reason to suspect that that will not be the case. The aspects that require the backing of legislative teeth are those that the Minister has promised to consider. The Democrats certainly support him in that promise. We shall certainly keep a close eye on and look very carefully at that proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Minister has identified in the statement that, as a matter of priority, in the interim the Minister will be asking the Commission to develop guidelines for a number of administrative practices, which include time limits for determination of reviews, surveillance practices, the current practice of using medical panels and the procedures for reviews of disputed claims. That little list identifies the typical pattern of the sorts of complaints about the decisions that are made by the self-administering authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take up much more time, but the other thing I want to highlight is the fact that there has been confusion about the role and status of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the body to which people should normally be able to refer when they feel aggrieved by decisions that have been made by administering authorities. I am very pleased to see that in the statement the Minister has said that, because of some remaining confusion about the status of decisions and recommendations made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, he will also ask the Commission to consider that issue as a matter of urgency. I can only underline the fact that this is a matter of urgency, because there are people who have interpreted the statement made previously by Minister Beazley, when speaking about the status of recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, as applying to decisions and not recommendations. That confusion I hope will be removed by the statement made by the Minister for Industrial Relations that he will ask that the Commission consider this issue as a matter of urgency&mdash;and I certainly believe that it is urgent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pleasure that I find in relation to a number of the comments made in the ministerial statement is tempered by the fact that this is a ministerial statement; we have yet to see the legislation. That is in the future; it is a promise, or an assurance at least. We will have to be vigilant when the legislation is presented. As I said earlier, when I first became aware of the legislation before us I had little expectation that it could lead to such a prolonged discussion about what should or could be in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are most favourable prospects about what could result from legislation which gave teeth to the supervision of this whole process by Comcare, the Minister or the Commission. There are good prospects. We will have to wait. I promise that I will be vigilant in waiting because this is such an important matter and it impinges upon the livelihoods of so many people. All of these organisations have huge numbers of employees and, with such numbers, some of the measurements of productivity and efficiency have been inappropriate in the past. I look forward to seeing much more appropriate measurements of the equity and the appropriateness of the decisions that are made under the auspices of this package of legislation. I foreshadow that the Democrats will seek to move a couple of small amendments in the committee stage. The Democrats support the Bill at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman made a number of references to what the Opposition believed to be the case with respect to the Bill. I do not propose to deal with each of those references individually, other than to say that I think there is a genuine commitment by all parties&mdash;certainly the Government, which commissioned the report&mdash;to see that the Brown review report is implemented. We are all seized with equal passion that that be done expeditiously. There is no difference between us on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the genuine misunderstanding between us, which gave rise to the original confusion, is that the amendments that we include in this legislation tonight set up a framework which enables a commission to be appointed to work hand in glove with the Government in the implementation of the Brown review recommendations. The proposed commission will have the responsibility for managing workers' compensation and rehabilitation in the Government and in government business enterprises. Therefore, when this legislation appeared on the horizon it was perceived to be legislation which was meant to implement all of the Brown review and not for what it was&mdash;a framework which enables us to implement all of the Brown review. Thus, we got into a debate about whether the legislation is adequate for the implementation of the Brown review. It is not adequate for that. I have no difficulty in saying that. It is adequate to create the framework necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there has been any dilatoriness on behalf of the Government or on behalf of Comcare. There has been a misunderstanding on that point which has given rise to some confusion which is now cleared up. I also think, like all compensation matters, there are matters of outstanding claims and people feel aggrieved by an unsatisfactory settlement in their view of the claims. This always creates an extra background tension in dealing with legislation of this sort. I think that we have substantially got the matter right.

In fact, Australia Post, in particular, has chosen to interpret that to suit itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great reluctance that I will support the deletion of the clause. The position has now been articulated by Senator Chapman. I do so reluctantly because I recognise that, with the Australian Democrats' support, there is a majority in the chamber and we would lose were this to go to a vote. That is the first reason for reluctance, because there is some sense of need, in this case, for the convention to be supported. But we would lose it on a vote. I think reality should intrude into our considerations because the charge against us is not a charge that the substance of what we seek is unreasonable, but simply that the consultation process has not been as exhaustive as the Territory Government in this case would want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can have different views about the exhaustiveness or otherwise of consultative arrangements, but the importance of this element of the Bill is that it does not enact any change. What it would have done, were it to have gone ahead, would have been to clothe the Government with the power to make regulations which would bring about some change. Therefore, we are seeking simply a clothing of power to do things through regulations. The undertaking given by the Commonwealth to all of the States and the Territories&mdash;and I repeat it here for the record&mdash;was that we would not proceed with the regulations until such time as we had reached an agreement with the Territories and the States about the nature of those regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to address the Senate and commend the work of the North Australian Development Unit of the Department of Social Security. This particular unit has been based in northern Australia and has operated principally from offices in Darwin for a period of three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has recently made an announcement that this office is to be altered and functionally changed. In effect, it is to be disbanded and dissolved from within the Department of Social Security, and a new functional office&mdash;an office of northern development&mdash;is to be created within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the particularly hard circumstances under which the North Australian Development Unit has operated over many years, it has achieved results in the performance of its work in which many Australians can take a great deal of pride. The unit came into existence in late 1988 and commenced operation, I believe, in early 1989. For three years a number of senior officers&mdash;first, Mr Glenn Hurry; and more recently a series of other officers, Mr Ken Ross, Mr Barry Smith and Mr Ross Worthington&mdash;have contributed to the management of this unit. There have, of course, been a number of other very competent staff officers attached to the work of the unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the Senate Estimates <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> dated 14 May 1990 that I raised a number of issues with regard to the resource development and resource allocations of the Department of Social Security to this particular unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time it was indicated clearly by the officers of the Department of Social Security that the functional role of this group was to continue and that adequate resources would continue into the subsequent financial year for its ongoing work. I note that in the performance indicators of the Department of Social Security for the year 1991-92 the following mention is made with regard to the North Australia Development Unit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NADU is a small national administration outpost located in Darwin. The unit concentrates on the development of policies and strategies to improve the applicability and delivery of departmental programs and services to people residing in north Australia. NADU's work program is based on the outcomes of both departmental and community consultations.</PARA>
<PARA>I also note that the recently tabled annual report for 1990-91 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">50 Years of Service to Australia 1941-1991</EMPHASIS> by the Department of Social Security makes two scant comments with regard to this particular unit. One comment is made under the issue `The National Administration' in the chapter on the corporate overview of the Department and is to be found in one paragraph on page 9. On page 39 of the annual report, there is a slightly more comprehensive cover of the work of the unit and the work that it was undertaking for the financial year. I do not believe that those comments, either in the performance indicators or in the annual report for 1990-91, give proper and due credit to the work of this important section of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken the opportunity to review the various papers and projects that have been prepared by this unit in the three years of its existence. I highlight those particular research programs. The following research and discussion papers were undertaken:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.ATSI People in North Australia's Remote Area: Population Trends and Their Policy Implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.CDEP and DSS.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Department of Social Security Payments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities: A Review of Literature.</PARA>
<PARA>Each and every one of those research and discussion papers and occasional papers has provided an invaluable resource to many government departments and I hope to the Government itself in developing programs. Many of them may, of course, be embarrassing to the Government for its ongoing program. There are currently a number of other projects in the various stages of being completed, and I understand they will be concluded before the unit is disbanded at the end of January 1992.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Australian Family Living Standards Study (Joint AIFS/NADU).</PARA>
<PARA>The last in that list is a study in consultation with the Australian Institute of Family Studies which I believe is looking into food costs relative to urban centres and the costs of housing for social security recipients. Other projects are: social and economic circumstances of the aged in remote communities; and a community plan for the community on Mornington Island in north Queensland, another project being undertaken in conjunction with DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These current projects that will be wound up and concluded within the next six or eight weeks are vitally important. They must be published. I believe there is some indication that the Department may well not choose to publish these important projects that are still to be properly concluded. I would certainly be asking in the forthcoming Estimates for copies of each and every one of those project papers to be produced and certainly made available to all members of parliament and anyone else who has to work through the various policy implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the commencement of my speech, I certainly want to commend the work of all of the people who contributed to this important unit over the past three years. They have done an outstanding job, often under difficult circumstances, often with scant resources, often having to cope with the various bureaucratic policies and politics between departments, and also with the constraints that obviously have been imposed by government policy. That is the praise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criticism that I want make about this issue relates to the fact that this year, on 9 October, a question was asked very seriously by Senator Reynolds of Senator Collins with regard to the broadening of the research activities that have in the past been undertaken by the North Australian Development Unit. In reply <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, along with others, I expressed considerable interest in broadening the Northern Australia Development Unit's activities which, until now, have been specific to the Department of Social Security, to encompass other portfolio areas of interest to Northern Australia. A particular concern was to provide through NADU some cross-portfolio coordination of these issues. After extensive consultation with the Prime Minister and several ministerial colleagues, particularly Senator Graham Richardson, the Minister for Social Security, it was decided to broaden the functions of this unit to enable it to conduct and sponsor research on potential economic and other developments in Northern Australia as well as research on social security and program delivery in line with the economic development and social justice strategies of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>On 13 November this year, Senator Reynolds directed another question to the Minister with the responsible portfolio, Senator Richardson. His response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not only a matter of making guarantees to Senator Reynolds about the value for money project. I think I can make a guarantee that all of the work that has been undertaken by that unit will be continued and furthered. Having Senator Collins involved is probably better in any event because, as the Minister for northern development, he is in touch with so many of the communities which will benefit from the work of NADU.</PARA>
<PARA>My criticism is that what has eventuated in the change of the administrative structure from the Department of Social Security to the Office of Northern Development in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under Senator Collins is a very significant change in the staff resources. For example, the current unit of 11 people is comprised of a senior officer grade B, six other research officers at grade C level, two ASO6s, one ASO3 and one research assistant. That has been the unit that has produced the outstanding level of work that I alluded to and praised earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now ascertained that, for the same Budget value that is being transferred to the Department of the Prime Minister, the new structure is to include, firstly, a chief executive officer. It has been announced that Mr Bill Gray, from ATSIC, will fill that particular position at secretary of department level. That would be a significant salary commitment; I presume in the order of some $90,000. The deputy will be at SES officer level 1, which would be a salary component of $64,000-odd plus benefits. There will be two officers at the SOG B level&mdash;two at the current senior officer level of the present unit&mdash;on salaries of $53,000, and under them two other clerical assistants, an ASO5 and an ASO4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the transfer of this function we now have a top-heavy group which will naturally be concerned with macro-policy issues but will not have the capacity to undertake any of the excellent field work that has been done in the past. None of the officers of the previous unit of the Department of Social Security would have been capable or competent enough&mdash;that is not a criticism of any one of them&mdash;to seek positions in the new structure. Therefore, we are going to lose those people as they transfer back to the Department of Social Security and other departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will end up with a new unit&mdash;an Office of Northern Development&mdash;in the Department of the Prime Minister that will be concentrating largely in two areas. There is to be a northern Australia social justice strategy and also an economic development strategy for northern Australia. If that is anything to go on, I am afraid there is still a lot of fear and criticism of where this new unit will be taking us. The new unit will continue to do policy work but it will not have the capacity to do the hands-on field work for which Senator Reynolds, I and so many others have praised NADU in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of involvement in the service delivery area is vital and must not be lost. It will therefore be incumbent on the Minister, Senator Collins, to ensure that we have a unit that will be effective and not just another front of senior officers, as we have seen in so many of these departmental areas of change by the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins commissioned a major economic study some time ago from the James Cook University, which he announced in Estimates hearings. He promised me a copy of an interim report of that group some 12 weeks ago. Whilst I know of other people who have received copies of it, I have been unable to obtain a copy of that taxpayer funded document. It will be very interesting to compare the value of its work with that of NADU. Certainly, we will need to assess the work of this new unit of the Office of Northern Development and ensure that it is not just another marginal seat strategy of the Labor Government, seeking to initiate ALP campaign policies rather than the decent and proper detailed work that the North Australian Development Unit has now been nobbled from doing. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the Government response to the Senate Committee report is being prepared now and should be completed by early March. The Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council has had an input into the Government's response.</PARA>
<PARA>As we are very close to the end of the year and the Minister said that nearly one year ago, what has happened to the Government response to that report? The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council of the DPI has responded by producing a worthwhile guide.

The subject of agricultural and veterinary chemicals is important and booklets such as this are essential for the broader education of the public. I commend this booklet to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter which I first noticed reported in the Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 25 November this year. It is a matter which has become of increasing concern to many residents of northern Tasmania. We were told in that article that the Latrobe Council had previously agreed to ask the Tasmanian Forestry Commission to restrict the clear-felling of trees on the upper slopes of the Dazzler Range above the 270-metre level. The Dazzler Range is a range of mountains in northern Tasmania which is clearly visible from the tourist areas of Port Sorell and Hawley Beach. That range is a backdrop to the Asbestos Range National Park. Cable logging operations in that area have left devastating scars on the hillside. The article gave this description:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The logged area is clearly visible from Port Sorell to Hawley, appearing as a grey quarry among an otherwise unbroken series of tree-covered hills.</PARA>
<PARA>I concur with that description. I visited the area just after the newspaper article was written, and that is an apt description&mdash;`a grey quarry among the otherwise tree-covered hills'. This logging creates considerable aesthetic pollution, and residents of the area, one of the fastest growing regions of the State, are understandably upset. I daresay that that is the reason why their council has approached the Forestry Commission. There is a great deal of concern about the wisdom of conducting logging operations on such steep slopes. The coupe in question has a slope of 48 degrees and this slope is very difficult to stand on. Such practice is in clear breach of the draft practices code of forestry in Tasmania, which sets an upper limit of 38 degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The erosion problems from such bad logging practices in this area could be disastrous. A private land-holder in the Dazzler Range located on Branch Creek is already taking action because of precisely this problem of erosion possibilities. The logging on steep slopes has led to soil erosion and Branch Creek is filling up with silt and logging debris. That results in flash flooding and the washing away of the creek beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure honourable senators who are listening have already associated in their minds the devastation recently in the Philippines, and the flooding and erosion which resulted in such tragedy, which has been ascribed to poor logging practices. The denudation of the hills and mountains in the Philippines is a larger manifestation of the very thing that I am talking about tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is that we really should have regard to this whole problem. If we need further explanation, it is available. It should be apparent to everybody that there are many regions where, with that sort of slope and the sort of rainfall that is experienced in the area, regeneration is made slow and difficult. With increased run-off, very little soil is left behind for plants to grow in and those that do take hold are left exposed to the high winds of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about an area that is very close to the shores of Bass Strait. Even those unfamiliar with Tasmania's topography would readily appreciate that in such an area regeneration of anything, let alone the original vegetative cover, is nigh impossible. It takes at least seven to 10 years before full ground cover and full ground protection are achieved. There is a possibility that the original cover will never be re-established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of these practices have been entrenched in the Tasmanian resource security legislation. They will be further set in concrete and could easily be further verified with Federal legislation. That is of great concern. Neither piece of legislation seems to address the problem of forest practices. The problem must be addressed. We see evidence daily on our television sets and we also see considerable discussion in the press of the problem that we have in Australia of the blue-green algae in the Darling River system and beyond. Surely, it is apparent to all that such a devastating environmental problem is a result of not being able to foresee the consequences of previously endorsed land management practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land management practices in the forest are those which determine the suitability of logging, the style of logging, the area which must be differentiated and the different practices to be instituted. That same parallel can be seen in our farming practices. We should learn these lessons. They are there for us to see. I raise this matter because it is yet another example of people pursuing in an ignorant fashion something which should be demonstrable to all and from which we all should have learned ages ago. How these forests are managed in the bush affects all people directly. It affects us in how the forest looks. It affects us in the quality of our lives. It affects us in the situation of the water catchment areas and it affects us in our future prospects for land use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot afford to ignore any opportunity that we, as a community as a whole, have to take part in and to have some say in these matters. At the moment the prospect of the Tasmanian resource security legislation and the prospect of Federal legislation are likely to reduce the opportunity that anybody has to participate further in that debate. What is happening right now in the Dazzler Range and in pockets of other communities in Tasmania is what is not being addressed by anybody's forest legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems apparent that, apart from a very small piece in the Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> in which it was pointed out, as I previously mentioned, that we are looking at a quarry where we were previously looking at full vegetative cover, this matter is not being addressed. It is apparent that our State Government in Tasmania is more concerned with what large companies want to do with the trees after they have stripped the hillsides bare. We have little opportunity in the community to take part in the debate. Not only is that disappointing but it is also tragic. In Australia we see the absolute tragedy of poor land management and poor land use. It can only be a lesson from which, I am sure, we will all say, `I wish we had thought about that some decades ago'. Here we have another opportunity to think about it and be aware what resource security legislation in this place would mean for Australia as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to take a few minutes of the Senate's time on a matter of some importance and of some particular significance to me. During the days preceding the New South Wales ALP Conference, which was convened on 7 and 8 December 1991, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> ran a series of articles that were inaccurate, damaging to me and defamatory of me, regarding matters which, ultimately, were debated at the New South Wales Labor Party Conference. This happened repeatedly, and in the majority of circumstances the journalists concerned, Prudence Anderson and Michael Dwyer, did not afford me the opportunity either to rebut the anonymous and false allegations or to defend myself; indeed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> appeared to lend itself willingly to a campaign of McCarthyist smearing, which assumed the proportions of a vendetta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first occasion on which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has published material that was damaging to me. In fact, on a previous occasion this newspaper was obliged to publish a correction concerning inaccurate material which it had printed falsely as fact. I rise tonight because this is the first opportunity that I have had to respond to these defamatory articles, having obtained the benefit of legal advice and not wishing to interrupt the Government's legislative program. It is my intention to commence legal proceedings against the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> over a number of false allegations that it published in late November and early December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I propose to deal with a number of allegations tonight, although might I say that it is not possible to deal with all of them in the course of one address to the Senate. Some matters I must leave exclusively to my lawyers. The first article in question appeared on 29 November under the by-line of Michael Dwyer, with various claims, all of them false. The claim, for example, that I had reneged on a cross-factional deal to resign as ALP National President is, of course, untrue. This claim suggests dishonesty and duplicity on my part. The claim was false and remains so. In fact, no such suggestion was ever made to me; no such undertaking was ever given by me; therefore it was not possible for me to breach any such commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second claim by Dwyer in this article was that the real value of the ALP Centenary House was probably less than $2m. This is also a false claim and remains so. In fact, the ALP Centenary House was valued professionally for the ALP at $3.8m. This valuation was confirmed by the Commonwealth Bank at the time and, indeed, an offer for more money was received for the building after the purchase had been made. Michael Dwyer did not offer me the opportunity to answer these claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second article in question appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 2 December 1991 under the by-line of Prudence Anderson. The article accused me of misleading the New South Wales ALP about its rising debt. This claim is also false. Never at any time did I mislead the New South Wales ALP about its real financial situation. Indeed, for virtually all my period as General Secretary the New South Wales ALP operated in a financially sound manner. Anderson then cited anonymous sources accusing me of mismanaging my financial responsibility as New South Wales ALP General Secretary. This is also untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During seven years as Party Secretary of the New South Wales ALP that claim was never made by any person. No-one could have given more meticulous care to the financial situation confronting the New South Wales ALP than I did during my period of service. No-one could have been more open or forthright about our financial position than I was during that period. In this article, Anderson then claimed, again referring to anonymous sources, that I was guilty of a deliberate financial cover-up. This is also untrue. In fact, the contrary is the case. When the real extent of the Party's financial difficulties in New South Wales emerged, I urged the current General Secretary, Mr John Della Bosca, to make the situation public and to begin a fundraising campaign, on the basis of the pressures upon us. Mr Della Bosca is happy to confirm this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, at the time I also urged earlier and more regular meetings of the New South Wales ALP finance committee, which I chaired between the middle period of 1990 and the end of 1991. Senator Sue West, a member of the finance committee, is only too happy to confirm this reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> ignored the salient reality that all of the New South Wales ALP's financial accounts are made public on an annual basis to the Party conference. That occurred every year during the period in which I was Secretary. It certainly occurred in June 1990 when the purchase of the ALP Centenary House was ratified by the Party conference. No material was withheld; no material was concealed. Access to all details of the Party's financial circumstances was afforded members of the New South Wales ALP administrative committee and finance committee for the entire period during which I was Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citing anonymous sources again, Anderson maintained that the ALP Centenary House was never intended to be occupied in celebration of the New South Wales ALP centenary year, that it was merely bought as a speculative initiative. This is untrue, as any cursory examination of documents presented to the June 1990 conference in support of the purchase will attest. Moreover, I specifically rejected a proposition for the sale of the building&mdash;that is, ALP Centenary House&mdash;for more money after the purchase was concluded on the simple basis that 291 Sussex Street, Sydney was not bought as a speculative initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The journalists concerned, Dwyer and Anderson, wrote an article on 4 December 1991 which again cited anonymous sources accusing me of withholding information from the Labor Council of New South Wales. This again is untrue. In fact, the Labor Council of New South Wales did not become officially involved in the Labor Centenary House project until long after I had resigned as Secretary of the Party. The article repeated the defamation that I had agreed to the purchase of Labor Centenary House prior to approval by the New South Wales ALP administrative committee. This is manifestly untrue, as any cursory examination of the ALP administrative committee minutes will confirm. Anderson and Dwyer went on to claim that I had assured the administrative committee that the New South Wales Labor Council had agreed to take up a one-third share in the project. This is again manifestly untrue. Again, a simple reading of the New South Wales Labor Party administrative committee minutes will verify the truth of what I am saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The false and defamatory claims concerning the purchase of the building and the briefing of the New South Wales administrative committee are repeated in an article on 5 December 1991. The inaccuracy of the claims made by Anderson and Dwyer can be seen vividly, in that they refer to the Labor Council of New South Wales purchasing a one-third share in Labor Centenary House in May 1991. Given that I had retired as General Secretary of the New South Wales ALP in June 1990, I would have thought it obvious that it would not have been possible for me to have misled the Labor Council regarding its formal involvement or to be held responsible, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> apparently holds me responsible, for the problems that subsequently arose due to financial pressures on the New South Wales Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate might take note that in all of these false claims and untrue allegations no-one is identified as having made them. All of the sources are anonymous. This is surely a very low point in journalistic standards. Put simply, McCarthyism cannot flourish without journalists and publications willingly lending themselves to a process by which scurrilous claims are printed as fact without attribution. The Senate might also take care to note that when the campaign against me failed on the morning of Saturday, 7 December 1991, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> chose to report this as a minor item on its inside pages the following Monday morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that I made a serious political error in the days preceding the New South Wales ALP Conference. I underestimated dramatically the levels to which my political opponents would sink in their campaign of personal denigration and defamation of me. In conclusion, no-one among my political opponents ought to underestimate my resolve on these matters. My lawyers have been instructed to take the appropriate action immediately. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The 21st meeting of the Australian Fisheries Council (AFC) was held in Wellington New Zealand at the invitation of the New Zealand Government. Meetings are usually held annually on rotation in each State and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are important reasons why a meeting of the AFC was held in Wellington. Australia and New Zealand enjoy a close working relationship on a range of fisheries matters of mutual interest such as, for example, the development of global management arrangements for southern bluefin tuna, the management of straddling stocks of orange roughy, South Pacific co-operation, surveillance and monitoring of fisheries in the Tasman Sea and efforts designed to bring about a cessation of driftnet fishing on the high seas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand has participated actively in AFC meetings as an observer since 1984.  Following an understanding reached at Prime Ministerial level consideration is being given to New Zealand becoming a full participating member of a number of Ministerial Councils, including fisheries. The main benefits from having New Zealand as a full member involve a desire on the part of both our countries to deepen and broaden the trans-Tasman relationship across a number of fronts and especially to reinforce Closer Economic Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) All State and Territory Governments bear the costs of their own participation in AFC meetings. Costs to the Commonwealth covered the Commonwealth delegations to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and the Australian Fisheries Council involving travel and accommodation as well as the operation of the Secretariat. Total costs to the Commonwealth amounted to $23 506. However, the New Zealand Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) provided extensive assistance to the Secretariat and all transport within New Zealand for the Commonwealth and some State Ministers. Hospitality is traditionally paid for by the host State, in the case of 1991, New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Given that the meeting venue rotates amongst all members, the majority of AFC meetings will be held in Australia.
