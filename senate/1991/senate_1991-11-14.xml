<TITLE>Drugs</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth; that we support your efforts to strengthen our family and community life particularly by increased penalties for "drug pushers" and distributors. We, however, wish to register our firm opposition to any legal changes which would increase or encourage the distribution or availability of so-called "soft drugs" such as marijuana. We believe such drugs to be harmful to the physical and psychological health of the individual and therefore to the interest of the community of which such individual is part. Although there is current controversy concerning the question of such harm it appears to us quite foolish to legalise and encourage the use of such drugs unless or until it be shown that such drugs are in fact harmless. The serious social problems of alcohol should provide sufficient warning to our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any efforts to legalise or decriminalise usage or distribution of such drugs will have the following results:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Encourage and inculcate a social acceptability towards such drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. Increase the volume of usage of such drugs in schools and the community by present users and by "drug pushers" through the proposed one ounce legal possession.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. Put pressure upon Parliament to establish and license import, growth, manufacture and/or distribution of such drugs, that is, to regulate another destructive industry contrary to the best interest of the individual and society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">5. There would be the probable temptation to tax such drugs as another source of Federal revenue.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will firstly take no measures that could extend the major social problem of drug usage and secondly will oblige those who are promoting marijuana and/or similar drugs to prove without doubt that such drugs are harmless before any legalisation or decriminalisation of use is introduced.

<PARA>NATIONAL ROAD TRANSPORT COMMISSION BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing to the Senate the  National Road Transport Commission Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will establish a National Road Transport Commission and bring into effect the Inter-governmental Agreement signed on 30 July 1991 by the Prime Minister and Heads of Government of all the States and the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the Commission to be responsible for the development and recommendation of national road transport legislation and road use charges. This includes the preparation and provision of guidelines and principles of administration. The functions and powers of the Commission will be those that are set out in the Inter-governmental Agreement which is included as a schedule to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides the administrative framework for the National Road Transport Commission. National road transport legislation will be developed by the Commission once it is established and will be introduced as separate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the terms of the Inter-governmental Agreement, national road transport legislation will be limited in its coverage to vehicles with a gross vehicles mass of more than 4.5 tonnes. Extension of the jurisdiction of the Commission to include light vehicles is currently under consideration through the Special Premiers' Conference processes. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to emphasise that this Bill does not in itself affect current road transport legislation or charges. It simply establishes an institutional framework for a national, co-operative approach to the development of future road transport legislation which is consistent across jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will be required to develop and recommend national road transport legislation and charges to a Ministerial Council. The Ministerial Council consists of a Minister representing each of the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth Government. Each Minister has equal representation on the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Territory does not have a member on the Ministerial Council as it is not a signatory to the Inter-governmental Agreement. Although it decided not to  sign the Agreement, it does support the establishment of the Commission. The Northern Territory has stated that it will implement non-charging regulations which are agreed to by the Ministerial Council. In recognition of this commitment, the Northern Territory has been granted observer status at the Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA>In discussing the contents of the Bill, I will outline the issues that will be considered by the Commission and the work that it will be undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government is committed to a competitive and efficient transport system. Cheaper and more efficient transport means greater success in ensuring Australia's industries are more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>More rational road use charges will provide the signal to improve the economic efficiency of the vehicle fleet and use and management of the road system. The road asset is one of the community's largest investments and increasing returns on this asset will provide significant lasting benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>Transport has a strategic role to play in improving Australia's international trading performance. It employs around 400 000 people and contributes about eight per cent of Gross Domestic Product. Road transport alone accounts for about four per cent, or approximately half of the transport component of national income. </PARA>
<PARA>More importantly, it is an intermediate service that is used by almost every industry and consumer. Virtually every product has at some point been carried by a road transport vehicle. Manufacturers rely increasingly on just-in-time deliveries. The quality of the service directly affects the efficiency of the rest of the economy. Thus, any initiative that improves the performance of road transport will have a positive effect on the rest of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Transport has a pervasive influence over the efficiency of our economy and improvements in the system will have significant national benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission has estimated that a more efficient land transport system, including a more efficient rail system, alone could realise an additional six billion dollars in Gross Domestic Product every year. </PARA>
<PARA>We have demonstrated our commitment to gaining an efficient rail sector through the establishment of the National Rail Corporation earlier this year. The National Road Transport Commission will also play a pivotal role in developing an  efficient, national operating environment for road transport. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has been striving to improve the operating environment for the road transport industry since it came to office in 1983. It has achieved significant improvements in industry efficiency in recent years through the development of more uniform technical and operating standards for heavy vehicles, particularly the adoption of uniform mass and dimension limits. Most progress has been made on technical issues where the Commonwealth has the clear power to legislate. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 has ensured that uniform national design standards apply to all vehicles new to the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA>The Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 provided the Federal Government with the means to encourage the harmonisation of regulations affecting heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation introduced the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) for vehicles engaged solely in interstate trade. The Scheme enabled the achievement of a uniform 42.5 tonne mass limit throughout Australia which delivered major productivity gains to road transport and the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Most recently, the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Act 1991 has allowed B-Doubles to be registered under FIRS. </PARA>
<PARA>Previous attempts to introduce harmonisation across different regulatory and charging environments have relied on two factors: agreement being reached in the Australian Transport Advisory Council; and, on the implementation of these agreements through policy directive and/or complementary legislative change. </PARA>
<PARA>As ATAC is only an advisory and consultative body with no powers to require individual jurisdictions to implement agreed proposals, this process has had limited success in achieving a nationally consistent approach. </PARA>
<PARA>Each State and Territory still has its own legislation covering the registration, regulation and charging of heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>What makes the Commission different from previous attempts at such a co-operative process is that it alone will develop charges and regulations for consideration by Governments. The Ministerial Council will be a  determinative body overseeing a streamlined legislative and regulatory process. </PARA>
<PARA>A fundamental aim of the Inter-governmental Agreement is to ensure that a transparent road use charging system is developed which provides a clear link between road use and the contribution to the costs of road maintenance by the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, there is little clear relationship between road use and damage caused by heavy vehicles, and charges paid by road users. A road transport operator sees little or no direct connection between his use of the road and what is paid for this privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>The Inter-governmental Agreement requires the introduction of a national charging structure comprising a nominal administration charge, a road use charge component of Commonwealth diesel excise and a registration or mass-distance charge for vehicles which do not meet their road costs through fuel payments alone. </PARA>
<PARA>The road use part of diesel excise is to be structured to avoid the imposition of mass-distance charges on most of the heavy vehicle fleet. </PARA>
<PARA>The level of charges will be developed by the Commission based on the following principles:</PARA>
<PARA>-full recovery of all road costs while minimising over-recovery from any vehicle class;</PARA>
<PARA>-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a common methodology;</PARA>
<PARA>-charges to be determined and collected in a way that achieves a reasonable balance between administrative simplicity, efficiency and equity in the charging structure;</PARA>
<PARA>-improved pricing, leading to a better allocation of resources, with investment decisions being based on more relevant demand signals; and</PARA>
<PARA>-minimising the incentive for operators to `shop around' for lower charges and undermine the integrity of the national charging system. </PARA>
<PARA>In recognition of the varying road costs in different parts of the country, two zones have been established for the purpose of charging. These zones generally reflect on the one hand the States with higher road costs, and those with lower road costs on the other. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of the National Road Transport Commission is the direct result of the resolve shown by all the States and the Commonwealth through the Special Premiers' Conference to develop an efficient national structure for land transport. It will be the focal point of a more efficient and clearly defined process for gaining nationally consistent charges and regulations relating to heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the Commission to have three part-time members who will be chosen for their ability to bring an independent view and range of experience to the Commission. Each member will be appointed by the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Ministerial Council, for a term of three years and may be reappointed only once. From the three members, one will be appointed as Chairperson of the Commission and another as Deputy Chair. </PARA>
<PARA>The objective of the Commission will be to facilitate improvements in road transport efficiency and road safety, and reductions in the costs of administration of road transport through a cooperative process between local government, the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth. The implementation of lasting reform is only possible with the cooperation of all levels of Government and affected transport providers and user groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 3<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>of the Bill sets out the functions and powers which will enable the Commission to achieve its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the Commission will have those functions and powers that are conferred upon it in the Inter-governmental Agreement. The Commission will exercise responsibility for the development of road transport legislation and for overseeing its administration by the States and the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The key aspect of the work of the National Road Transport Commission will be the development and recommendation of road use charges. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will be required to report on or provide advice to the Ministerial Council on any matter relating to its powers and functions. </PARA>
<PARA>While there is clear emphasis on the accountability of the Commission to governments through the Ministerial Council,  the Commission will be reflecting the broader interests of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>To assist it in discharging its responsibilities in this regard, the Commission will consult widely with interested parties including the road transport industry, industry in general, and people and government organisations from rural and remote regions. </PARA>
<PARA>It may also appoint committees to assist it in discharging its duties under the terms of this legislation. These committees will have such membership as the Commission considers appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the administrative provisions of the Bill. This part of the Bill sets out the conditions relating to members of the Commission. It also establishes the basic meeting procedures for the Commission and provides for disclosure of interest by individual members. </PARA>
<PARA>The staffing provisions will enable the staff of the Commission to reflect the Commission's national character. The Commission will be able to employ staff, within the limits of its budget, from the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>A Chief Executive Officer will be appointed by the Commission to manage the operations of the NRTC according to the directions and policies determined by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Staff may also be employed through secondment arrangements with Commonwealth, State or Territory administrations. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the finance provisions of this Bill, the Commission will receive funding from the Commonwealth, the States and the Australian Capital Territory. The funding share of each Government will be determined by the Ministerial Council as set out in the Inter-governmental Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment and running costs of the National Road Transport Commission will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the States and Territories party to the Inter-governmental Agreement. At the first Ministerial Council meeting it was agreed that the Commonwealth would contribute a 35 per cent fixed share of costs with the remainder being shared by the States and Territories based on heavy vehicle registrations. It is anticipated that the Commission's annual budget will total $3-4 million. The Commonwealth has included a provision of $1 million in this year's Budget as its contribution to the establishment and maintenance of the Commission in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the final, miscellaneous provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to the powers and functions of the Ministerial Council, the Ministerial Council may delegate any or all of these to any one or more of its members. Such delegation must be made through a unanimous decision by the Members of the Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation will cease to be in force after six years. At least six months prior to this, the Commission is required to make a recommendation to the Ministerial Council as to whether the legislation should be re-enacted. This follows the procedure established in the Inter-governmental Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>All Members of the Ministerial Council and the Australian Local Government Association have considered the Bill and  agree that it reflects the letter and spirit of the Inter-governmental Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of the Commission will reduce duplication of work between the States and the Commonwealth. It will also ensure that all Governments will be working from a common perspective. No longer will we be in the situation where nine different bureaucracies are working to develop nine different sets of regulations affecting road transport. For the first time we will have nationally consistent regulations governing heavy vehicles. This is a significant achievement and is a clear demonstration of the maturity of Australia as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL RAIL CORPORATION  AGREEMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing the  National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to allow the Commonwealth to approve the Shareholders' Agreement relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation (NRC). </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill represents another major step in the implementation of the Government's micro-economic reform program which is directed at creating a more productive, efficient and flexible economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill involves significant restructuring: in this case of rail institutions, technology, management and work practices. Without such initiatives we will be unable to meet the community's current needs, let alone our future needs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an important transport reform. Transport affects almost every area of Australian economic and social activity. As a significant intermediate cost, efficient transport is vital to the competitiveness of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Even small improvements in the efficiency of our transport system offer potentially large economic and social gains. </PARA>
<PARA>This is highlighted by a number of major studies in recent years, which have exposed the deficiencies in our transport system and the potential gains from reform. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1989-90 the Industry Commission estimated that a more efficient land transport system, including a more efficient rail system, alone could realise an additional $6 billion in Gross Domestic product every year. Of this, $4.4 billion was attributable to rail. </PARA>
<PARA>More recently, in its October 1991 report on rail transport, the Industry Commission confirmed the importance of reforming the rail industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia cannot afford to ignore such gains, particularly given their potential for contributing to economic growth and our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the major problems in the rail industry is the inability of the existing systems to obtain their proper share of interstate freight, particularly on the eastern seaboard. This is due in the main to the quality of the service that rail delivers. Terminals are inadequate, work and management practices need improvement, and reliability needs to be greatly improved. It is widely acknowledged that much of the problem lies in the fragmented management of rail. </PARA>
<PARA>That said, the position is not irredeemable. Industry has said that it would make greater use of rail if a reliable, quality service were provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, rail can confidently be said to have a bright future, provided it can be operated efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA>There are some types of traffic where rail beats the competition hands down. The most obvious example of this is the carriage of freight over medium to long distances. </PARA>
<PARA>If rail undertakes the tasks to which it is best suited, and is efficient, it can carry goods at a lower cost to the community than road transport. And there will be savings in terms of accidents, air and noise pollution and energy costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly the Federal Government has positively promoted the revitalisation of the interstate rail freight system. This is part of a broader set of transport industry objectives within which each of the transport modes can undertake the tasks to which it is best suited. It is not a matter of favouring one mode over another. What the Government is striving for is an integrated transport system that will provide the community with an efficient and competitive land transport system. </PARA>
<PARA>That rail can be a success in Australia has been clearly demonstrated by the Commonwealth's own railway: the Australian National Railways Commission (AN). AN has long practised the commercial approach that will be taken by the National Rail Corporation (NRC) and its success is clear for all to see. The Industry Commission acknowledged this achievement in its recent rail report. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate AN, its employees and management for the efforts they have put in since its creation in 1978. Indeed, I expect that the skills and expertise built up by AN will prove to be a valuable asset for the NRC. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Establishment of the NRC</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Recognising the need for change, the Commonwealth and all the mainland States except South Australia, signed an agreement establishing the National Rail Corporation (NRC) at the Special Premiers' Conference in July 1991. For the first time all interstate rail freight operations will be brought under one management structure. </PARA>
<PARA>South Australia supports the Corporation and proposes to sign the agreement after a range of issues under its Railway Transfer Agreement with the Commonwealth are resolved through bilateral negotiation. Queensland chose not to become an equity participant at this stage although it has committed itself to giving every assistance to the NRC. Provision has been made in the Agreement for Queensland and South Australia to become equity participants, if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA>The NRC has been incorporated under the Companies Code as a strictly commercial corporation at arms-length from government. The directors of the Company have to comply with all relevant provisions of the Company Law, including the obligation to act in the interests of all shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>The Company has been established for the purpose of conducting interstate rail freight operations on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The Company will:</PARA>

<PARA>Any new rail projects undertaken by the NRC will be subject to the normal State and Federal environmental legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is expected that the cash equity injections of $415 million provided for by the Agreement, together with commercial borrowings by the NRC, will lead to the speedy elimination of interstate rail deficits. The NRC is expected to break even within three years and become totally self supporting after five. The meeting of this target will in itself be a major achievement. Interstate rail freight deficits are currently around $375 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA>The NRC was incorporated in September and Directors were appointed to the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>The Board is recruiting a management team who will negotiate an enterprise award with the unions and develop a Corporate Plan (including an investment strategy). These must be completed prior to the injection of capital funds by the shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>The enterprise award to be negotiated by the NRC with rail unions will reflect the most efficient work and staffing practices, determined by the technical capacity of its equipment and commercial considerations. It is proposed that the NRC employ only those people that it needs for its operations: other employees will remain with the existing rail systems. </PARA>
<PARA>The NRC is scheduled to commence actual rail operations early in 1992, beginning with marketing and terminal operations. Customers will then no longer have to deal with up to five separate rail authorities to transport freight across the country. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment of the NRC heralds an historic development in the revitalisation of Australia's rail industry. The Corporation will provide a strong impetus to overall reform in the rail industry and the land transport sector in general. </PARA>
<PARA>For the first time in the history of this country, the NRC  will ensure that rail investment decisions are based on commercial considerations with the needs of a national network  being paramount. Problems of the past, which led to three different track gauges, different signalling technologies and varying work practices, will not be permitted to continue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to approve the Shareholders' Agreement relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation (NRC). A copy of the Agreement is provided in a Schedule to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides that the Company does not have the protection of the Crown. That is, it is simply a Company incorporated under the Companies Code, subject to all Commonwealth, State and local government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the legislative transfer of assets and contracts, and for any third parties to be compensated if they suffer any damages as a result of such a transfer. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides that the Governor-General may make Regulations consistent with the Act. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides that the Commonwealth may pay money in accordance with the Shareholders' Agreement, but does not of itself appropriate such moneys. These are appropriated in the Budget. The Commonwealth's cash equity contributions to be under the NRC Agreement amount to $296 million over the next six years, including $40 million in 1991/92. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition the establishment of the NRC will have an impact on the deficits of railway systems. Total losses on interstate rail freight (including AN) was estimated to have amounted to $377 million in 1989/90. The NRC is expected to break even within three years and be fully self sufficient within five years, leading to a reduction in the call on all taxpayers, State and Federal. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum for this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill proposes amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, the Navigation Act 1912, the Pipeline Authority Act 1973  and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the Bill are explained in detail in the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum. I will, therefore, confine my comments to the broad thrust of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (known as the CERC Act) are contained in Part 2 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees (which operates as Comcare), was established under the CERC Act in December 1988 to effectively manage the Commonwealth public sector workers compensation function. The legislation introduced income-related benefits and emphasised the Commission's role in the prevention of workplace injury and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured workers. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments implement changes based on a recent review of the Comcare program. The Review was conducted by Mr Ron Brown, a management consultant. He was commissioned in December 1990 to carry out a comprehensive review of the Comcare program including the self administrators. </PARA>
<PARA>Comcare provides the full workers' compensation insurance function to around 250 Commonwealth public sector agencies. Australia Post and Telecom, however, have been operating as "self administrators" on a two year trial. Under the self administration arrangements, these two organisations are responsible for all aspects of the administration of the CERC Act in relation to their own staff. </PARA>
<PARA>The Review was asked to consider the effectiveness of the Comcare scheme and any policy and legislative changes needed to better achieve the Government's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The Review acknowledged the success of improvements in workers compensation arrangements and policy achieved by the Commission since its establishment. Nevertheless, it targeted additional areas where effectiveness could be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the Commission, is to be restructured to separate its regulatory and service functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the new provisions, the restructured Commission will be a tripartite body responsible for regulatory functions associated with the CERC Act, including determining and setting premiums, occupational health and safety and licensing of compensation self administrators. A new statutory body to be called Comcare is to be established, with responsibility for commercial and service functions under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments create a new position of Chief Executive Officer of Comcare. The Chief Executive Officer is to be a member of the new Commission and to have responsibility for all functions under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and the CERC Act, other than those performed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The new Commission and the Chief Executive Officer of Comcare will be subject to Ministerial direction and will be required to prepare Annual Reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the amendments made in this Part of the Bill provide for the separation of the powers and functions of the current Commission between the new Commission and the new body to be known as Comcare. The Bill also provides for the transition from the current legislative scheme, to that which will result from the amendments, to ensure an orderly changeover. A number of other consequential changes are also made. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 are contained in Part 3 of the Bill and are designed to assist industry in the development and the use of chemicals and are therefore consistent with the government's policy of enhancing industry development. </PARA>
<PARA>The Act establishes the National Industrial Chemical Notification and Assessment Scheme. The Scheme requires that importers and manufacturers of new industrial chemicals submit a package of data on the chemical to Worksafe Australia in order that the chemical can be assessed before its introduction into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill amends the Act to allow for a joint application to be made for an assessment certificate in relation to a new industrial chemical. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, the Act does not allow a joint application by two or more persons for an assessment certificate in relation to the importation and use of the same new industrial chemical. Where two or more persons wish to have the same chemical assessed, the Act currently requires separate applications to be submitted to the Director of Industrial Chemicals and the required information to be supplied by all applicants. This results in overlap in the information provided to the Director. It has also inhibited co-operation between applicants, usually companies, in the manufacture and use of industrial chemicals. The practice also leads to unnecessary duplication and inefficiency in the chemicals industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The major amendment, at clause 29 of the Bill, will allow two or more persons, manufacturing or importing the same new industrial chemical, to make a joint application for assessment of that chemical. </PARA>
<PARA>The other clauses in Part 3 of the Bill are consequential upon introducing a legislative scheme that allows for a joint application for assessment. For example the amendments made by clause 31 of the Bill provides for each party to a joint assessment to be issued with an assessment certificate. Other amendments made in Part 3 of the Bill are of a minor, consequential or technical nature. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the  Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, which makes provision for long service leave for Commonwealth employees, are contained in Part 4 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment in clause 36 of the Bill will enable regulations to be made under the Act to provide that certain categories of payments are excluded from "salary" for the purposes of calculating long service leave entitlements. In addition the regulations shall be able to provide the extent and circumstances in which payments in those categories are excluded from "salary" for the purposes of the Act. Currently, regulations may only be made to prescribe those payments which are to be included as `salary' for long service leave purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Navigation Act 1912</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments to the Navigation Act, which are in Part 5 of the Bill, arise out of the Government's initiative to increase the number of Conventions of the International Labour Organisation ratified by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>As a general rule Australia does not ratify a Convention until law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions complies with the requirements of the Convention. The proposed amendments are intended to achieve compliance with three maritime Conventions, thus enabling them to be ratified. The Conventions are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medical Examination (Seafarers) Convention, 1946 (No.73);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Accommodation of Crews Convention (Revised), 1949 (No.92); and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Accommodation of Crews (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1970. </PARA>
<PARA>Each of the Conventions is regarded as appropriate for ratification once compliance has been achieved. Although there is substantial compliance in practice, some States and the Northern Territory do not have legislation giving effect to the Conventions. </PARA>
<PARA>The three Conventions apply to sea-going ships. Most sea-going ships in Australian waters are engaged in inter-state or overseas voyages and therefore come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth and are, therefore, covered by the Navigation Act. A small number of sea-going ships, however, come within the jurisdiction of a State or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments, which have been developed in consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, will enable regulations and orders to be made under the Navigation Act to give effect to the Conventions in respect of all sea-going ships in Australian waters. These orders and regulations will not, however, apply where any existing or future law of a State or of the Northern Territory gives effect to the Conventions. This will ensure that the Conventions are applied to all sea-going ships in Australian waters, while preserving the jurisdiction of the States and the Northern Territory in respect of the matters covered by the Conventions. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Pipeline Authority Act 1973</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 are contained in Part 6 of the Bill. The Pipeline Authority Act establishes the Pipeline Authority which is the body charged with the function of constructing pipelines for the conveyance of petroleum to cities. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments to the Act are minor and correct an amendment made by the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act 1991 Act No. 122 of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>An amendment made to the Pipeline Authority Act by that Act was not in accordance with the Government's intention that the Pipeline Authority be able to grant part-time members leave to be absent from meetings of the Authority. The amendment proposed in clause 41 of the Bill gives effect to that intention. The Minister retains the discretion to grant a full-time member of the Authority leave of absence. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will strengthen and improve the working of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 in significant respects. It introduces a range of amendments directed at substantially reforming the law relating to discharge from and annulment of bankruptcy, contributions by bankrupts to the bankrupt estate from their income, and practice and procedure at meetings of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall briefly outline the administrative and legislative context in which the Bill has been prepared, and some of the principal amendments proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>Bankruptcy has traditionally had two principal aims, the first being the return of funds to creditors, and the second being the rehabilitation of the bankrupt. The mechanisms in the Act for obtaining income contributions from bankrupts who are able to make some contribution to their estate have proved in recent times to be less effective than they should be. There have also been expressions of concern in the community that legislative measures should be taken to make the mechanisms more effective, but not in such a way as to disadvantage persons with low incomes. Similarly, access to early discharge from bankruptcy has been denied to many bankrupts because of the legal costs associated with obtaining an early discharge. </PARA>
<PARA>The two main purposes of the Bill are, first, to establish a more efficient and effective means of securing contributions from the income of a bankrupt and secondly, to enhance the opportunities of those bankrupts, with levels of debt that they have no prospect of repaying, to be able to return to full participation in the community after a suitable period of financial rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA>The more significant features of the Bill fall into the following main categories:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">substitution of the Court based (ordered)  early discharge system with an administrative system based on clearly specified eligibility and disqualification criteria;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">clarification of the grounds on which a bankruptcy can be prolonged by self executing objection, and provision for objections in certain circumstances to extend bankruptcies to periods of 8 years;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">imposition of a prohibition on overseas travel by bankrupts liable to make contributions from income without court approval;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduction of a compulsory income contributions regime applicable to bankrupts who have an income above a specified threshold amount;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduction of new administrative enforcement mechanisms to facilitate the recovery of property into bankrupt estates, and to enable efficient collection of contributions;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">expansion of powers of Official Receivers to obtain information and to undertake inquiries in relation to the financial affairs of bankrupts, including inquiries overseas;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">clarification and codification of creditors' meeting procedures to ensure that creditors are fully informed before making decisions relating to the future course of a bankruptcy administration, and enabling the removal of a trustee of an estate by majority in value (rather than by majority in number and at least three fourths in value) of creditors voting on a proposal for removal of a trustee;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">technical amendments to correct references to other legislation, and make consequential amendments previously omitted to be made, and provision of regular indexation of various money amounts specified in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, for the first time, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be given jurisdiction to review decisions of trustees and officials of the bankruptcy administration in connection with the proposed new discharge and income contribution arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Administrative Discharge System</PARA>
<PARA>The Act currently provides by section 150 that a person may apply to the Court at any time after the date of bankruptcy for an order of discharge, either before the three year statutory period expires, or in a case where the bankrupt is otherwise disentitled to automatic discharge, or where an objection has been entered to the bankrupt's discharge. Only a very small proportion of bankrupts avail themselves of the early discharge provisions, because of the costs involved with making an application to the court. In almost all cases where early discharge is sought, the order is granted. </PARA>
<PARA>Low income earners are greatly disadvantaged by this system and have no real opportunity to avail themselves of it. Commonly, persons who succeed in obtaining orders for discharge have become bankrupt as a result of failed business activities, and seek early discharge so as to enable them to resume such activities. These are usually also persons who have the capacity to contribute to the estate from income, but do not do so. The proposals in the Bill will restore equity to the operation of the early discharge system, and the eligibility and disqualification criteria are designed to ensure that where a person has become a bankrupt because of commercial culpability, he or she is disqualified from early discharge. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the scheme proposed in the Bill, a bankrupt will be able to apply for early discharge after 6 months from the time when he or she files a statement of affairs with the Registrar. The trustee must evaluate, on the basis of information available to him or her, whether the bankrupt is eligible for and is not disqualified from early discharge. The proposed eligibility criteria are that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the bankrupt has no or insufficient divisible property to enable a dividend to be paid,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the bankrupt has not disposed of property in a transaction that is void against the trustee, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the bankrupt earns an income which is less than the actual income threshold amount applicable to him or her at the time the application for early discharge is made. </PARA>
<PARA>This is provided for in proposed Subdivision C of Division 3 of Part VII of the Act, to be inserted by clause 27 of the Bill. Disqualifying criteria include where:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the bankrupt has previously been a bankrupt;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the unsecured liabilities of the bankrupt exceed 150% of his or her income in the year prior to the date of bankruptcy;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">more than 50% of the bankrupt's unsecured liabilities are attributable to the conduct by the bankrupt of business activities; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the bankrupt has given false or misleading information about his or her assets,  liabilities or income. </PARA>
<PARA>The disqualification criteria are set out in proposed Subdivision D of Division 3 of Part VII of the Act, to be inserted by clause 27 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Decisions by trustees in relation to early discharge will be subject to review by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Income Contributions</PARA>
<PARA>Section 131 of the Act currently provides that a bankrupt is able to retain income for his or her own benefit, subject to any order of the Court to the contrary. Section 131 has not been a particularly useful instrument for trustees in bankruptcy to employ. The court process is costly to invoke and, frequently, neither has the trustee funds available to initiate the process nor are creditors willing to advance funds to the trustee to enable the trustee to take action. Frequently, once made, orders are not complied with by the bankrupt. The only sanction for non-compliance with a contribution order is imprisonment for contempt of court. This is a severe sanction, and not particularly useful&mdash;an imprisoned bankrupt cannot earn income to contribute to the estate. </PARA>
<PARA>Many bankrupts earn quite large incomes but, for the reasons I have mentioned, they are not required to make any repayment to creditors from that income. In a case where the bankrupt has few, if any, divisible assets, the creditors will get nothing out of the process notwithstanding that the bankrupt may have a considerable capacity to pay. Furthermore, some bankrupts manage to put their assets out of the reach of creditors, and channel income away from themselves while still retaining a benefit, through the use of associated individuals, companies, partnerships or trusts, which are referred to in the Act as `associated entities' of the bankrupt. These associated entities may, and usually do, provide the bankrupt with substantial non-cash benefits, such as free or low cost housing, motor vehicles, boats, and payment of expenses. Very often the entity employs the bankrupt, and by virtue of that employment, the entity is able to generate substantial income. If the bankrupt ceased to be in the employment of the entity, its capacity to derive income would be lost. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill tackles these difficulties. The term `income' is defined to include not only income according to ordinary conceptions and usages, but also to include benefits, which, if they were provided by an employer to an employee, would be taxable as fringe benefits under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. `Income' will also include the amount of any money or the value of any other consideration, received by a person other than the bankrupt from another person or  associated entity as a result of work done or services performed by the bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA>A trustee in bankruptcy will be able to make an assessment of the full extent of the income likely to be derived by the bankrupt during the contribution assessment period. The contribution assessment period will be an annual period beginning at the commencement of bankruptcy, or the commencement of the amendments, and subsequently on each anniversary of that commencement, until the bankrupt is discharged, or the debts of the bankrupt are paid in full. Where the debts are paid in full, the bankruptcy will be annulled by operation of law. </PARA>
<PARA>In making an assessment of the bankrupt's likely income, or income likely to be derived during a period, the trustee will be able to have regard to any information about the bankrupt's employment or income, whether provided by the bankrupt or some other person. In a case where the bankrupt claims not to be in receipt of income, or claims to be unemployed but is nevertheless engaged in activities which resemble employment or other work, and which in fact generate or are capable of generating income for the bankrupt or some other person or associated entity, the trustee will be able to treat the bankrupt as being in employment and as deriving income. The trustee will be able to make an assessment of the bankrupt's income having regard to income likely to be derived by a person engaged in similar activities, under an industrial award or an arm's length contract of employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for a base income threshold amount equal to 3.5 times what at any time is the maximum basic rate of pension. This is prescribed under Item 3 Column 3, Table B, point 1064-B1, Pension Rate Calculator A in the Social Security Act 1991. As at 1 July 1991, this would reflect a gross annual income of $22,886.50 for a person with no dependants. `Income', for the purposes of determining the actual threshold amount and liability to contribute, will mean income net of tax and child support liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The actual income threshold amount will increase by percentages, based upon the child support percentages contained in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, according to the number of dependants&mdash;for instance, where there is one dependant wholly dependent on the bankrupt for economic support, the percentage increase in the base threshold is 18%, so that the actual income threshold amount applicable to such a person would be an after tax income of $21,388 ($411pw). Such a bankrupt, earning $22,308 per annum after tax ($430 pw) would have to contribute $9.35 per week. While a bankrupt with two dependants and an after tax income of $440.00 per week would be required to contribute $3.17  per week, a bankrupt with two dependants and an after tax income of $700.00 per week would have to contribute $133.17 per week. Proposed Division 4B of Part VI of the Act, to be inserted by clause 25 of the Bill contains the details of the assessment and collection process. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be provision for the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy to authorise departure from the relevant contribution level in cases of hardship for medical reasons, and other reasons specified in proposed section 139T of the Act. Decisions by trustees in relation to income assessments will be reviewable by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, and by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Persons whose assessed income is below the proposed `actual income threshold amount' will not be liable to make compulsory contributions, but may do so voluntarily. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes the insertion of provisions enabling the Official Receiver to collect moneys owing by way of contribution from persons other than the bankrupt. The provisions enabling this to be done, proposed sections 139ZK and 139ZL, are based on section 218 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and corresponding provisions in other legislation such as the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Objections to Automatic  Discharge and Related Changes</PARA>
<PARA>Section 149 of the Act currently provides for the entry of objections to the automatic discharge of a bankrupt on four grounds, namely that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the conduct of the bankrupt has been unsatisfactory,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the bankrupt has failed to co-operate in the administration of his or her estate,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the bankrupt is likely, within 5 years from the date of his or her bankruptcy, to make a significant contribution to his or her estate, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the discharge of the bankrupt would prejudice the administration of the estate. </PARA>
<PARA>These grounds are all rather vague and uncertain, and do not specify with sufficient particularity just what the obligations of bankrupts are, and what conduct is likely to result in an extension of the bankruptcy. The Bill proposes that these grounds be replaced by new grounds of objection designed to make the bankrupt fully aware of his or her obligations, and to encourage the bankrupt to co-operate with the trustee in carrying out the administration of the estate. </PARA>
<PARA>The new grounds for objecting to the automatic  discharge of the bankrupt are set out in proposed section 149D of the Act, to be inserted by clause 27 of the Bill. They include matters such as the bankrupt continuing to manage a corporation contrary to the Corporations Law, failure by the bankrupt to provide information about assets, liabilities and income where required by the trustee to do so, departure by the bankrupt from Australia without permission or failure to return where requested to do so, and failure by the bankrupt to attend a meeting of his or her creditors, or an examination or interview about his or her affairs. Some of these grounds will extend a bankruptcy for a period of up to 8 years, whilst the remainder will extend the bankruptcy for a period of 5 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Two related changes involve making the period of bankruptcy run for 3 years from the date on which the statement of affairs is filed by the bankrupt, instead of from the date of bankruptcy itself, and automatic annulment of a bankruptcy where the debts of the bankrupt are paid in full. In the case of bankruptcy on a debtor's petition, the date of bankruptcy and the date of filing of the statement of affairs will almost invariably be the same, since a debtor's petition cannot be accepted by the Registrar unless it is accompanied by a statement of affairs. Currently, in the case of a bankruptcy by sequestration order on the petition of a creditor, the bankrupt must file a statement of affairs within 14 days of the date of the order. Quite often, however, the bankrupt refuses or fails to comply with the requirement to file the statement of affairs, and this seriously hampers the carrying on of the administration. To ensure that the bankrupt does co-operate from the outset of the administration, the Bill proposes that the period until automatic discharge will not begin to run until the statement of affairs is filed. </PARA>
<PARA>Where a bankrupt pays all of his or her debts in full, or makes a proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement which is accepted by creditors in full satisfaction of their debts, amendments proposed by the Bill will have the effect of annulling the bankruptcy by operation of law. Under the Act at present, annulment of a bankruptcy can only occur by court order, even where the debts have been paid in full, or a composition or scheme has been approved. This is a costly and largely unnecessary procedure. The fact that upon payment in full of the debts the bankruptcy will be annulled by operation of law should act as a significant incentive to many bankrupts to make payment in full, or to come to a satisfactory arrangement with creditors. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Overseas Travel Restrictions</PARA>
<PARA>A bankrupt who is assessed as liable to make  contributions to the estate from his or her income will not be able to travel overseas except by permission of the Court. Permission will be able to be granted for compassionate reasons related to the death or serious illness of a close relative of the bankrupt, or where overseas travel is necessary to enable the bankrupt to continue to derive income. It will be necessary for the bankrupt to make an advance payment of the contribution he or she would be liable to pay during his or her proposed absence from Australia, or to otherwise satisfy the court that arrangements will be made whereby the contributions liability of the bankrupt will be met. Permission will not be granted where it is established that the bankrupt has been guilty of conduct that would found an objection to discharge under proposed section 149D. </PARA>
<PARA>Recovery of Property by Official Receiver</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will include provision to enable the Official Receiver, on behalf of the Official Trustee, and registered trustees to recover property, disposed of by a bankrupt in a transaction designed to defeat creditors which is void against the trustee, by administrative means instead of exclusively by litigation. Setting aside void antecedent transactions by litigation can cause difficulties for trustees, and bankrupts can arrange their affairs on occasions confident in the knowledge that no action will be taken to set aside the transaction because of the costs associated with doing so. The new administrative procedures provided for in proposed Subdivision J of Division 4B of Part VI of the Act to be inserted by clause 25 of the Bill are based on provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and will enable more cost effective setting aside of void antecedent transactions and a correspondingly greater return for creditors. </PARA>
<PARA>Official Receiver Powers to Make Inquiries</PARA>
<PARA>A significant measure included in the Bill, again based on a provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, is proposed Division 2 of Part V enabling the issue of `off-shore information notices' where evidence about a bankrupt's financial affairs and dealings is located in a foreign country. Where such a notice is issued, and the information is not provided as requested, the information will not be admissible in subsequent legal proceedings relating to the bankrupt, unless the person to whom the notice was directed proves that he or she was not in possession of the information, and that he or she could not have taken any reasonable steps to obtain it. </PARA>
<PARA>Clarification and Codification of Meeting Procedures</PARA>
<PARA>The Act currently contains only limited provisions to deal with the manner in which the business at meetings of creditors should be conducted, and in complex  bankruptcies, where there are many creditors, difficult questions of procedure at meetings sometimes can arise. The Bill proposes the insertion of provisions to spell out clearly the procedure which ought to be followed at meetings of creditors, so that trustees are aware of their responsibilities, and creditors are aware of their rights. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also includes provision to enable creditors to remove a trustee by resolution, rather than by special resolution as at present. A resolution is passed when a majority in value of creditors vote for the proposal, and a special resolution is passed where a majority in number and at least three fourths in value of the creditors vote in favour of the proposal. It is considered that with respect to the important question as to who is to occupy the office of trustee, the creditors with the most significant financial stake in the administration should not be outvoted by more numerous small creditors, as can happen under a special resolution. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Technical and Consequential Amendments</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will correct outdated references in the Act, and make amendments consequential to the enactment of other laws which have previously been omitted to be made. A number of areas of uncertainty, for example in relation to the right of a registered trustee to draw remuneration, will be clarified by the Bill. Mechanical provisions to aid in administration will also be included, such as a provision for the automatic indexation, in line with the Consumer Price Index, of various money amounts specified in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will make important reforms in bankruptcy, and will considerably modernise the Act's operation by extending the application of administrative law principles to decisions of trustees and bankruptcy officials, and by introducing Administrative Appeals Tribunal review. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed income contribution scheme will result in more funds being available to pay creditors. It is estimated that in the second and subsequent years of operation, an additional $3.1m per annum will be available to Commonwealth creditors, especially the Australian Taxation Office, and a further $6.2m per annum will be available as increased dividends payable to community creditors generally. In addition, it is estimated that the Insolvency and Trustee Service, Australia (ITSA), the Division of the Attorney-General's Department with responsibility for bankruptcy affairs, would take additional fees and other income of $2.2m in the first year of operation, increasing to $3.3m including fees taken by the Federal  Court of Australia, in the second and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Because the administration of the contributions and discharge schemes will be labour intensive, ITSA, which handles well in excess of 90% of all bankruptcies each year, will require additional staffing resources, costing approximately $1.09m in a full year of operation. Initial set-up costs, including the provision of computer connections, will cost approximately $507,000. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>I take pleasure in introducing the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991 to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments provided for in this Bill are necessary to accommodate certain changes to the drug approval process which were recommended by Professor Peter Baume in his "Report On The Future Of Drug Evaluation In Australia" and which were subsequently accepted by the Government for early introduction. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal thrust of these reforms is to give greater recognition to the need for early access by the Australian community to new drugs, provided of course that due attention is still paid to their safety, quality and efficacy. Thus one of the amendments is to the Objects of the Therapeutic Goods Act to provide specific reference to the pursuit of timely availability. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the introduction of certain changes to both application requirements and to the evaluation process it is intended to introduce certain target times for the processing of applications, with a financial penalty on Government in instances where those targets are not met. It is necessary to amend the Act to provide for the formal adoption of targets specifically recommended by Professor Baume. </PARA>
<PARA>Reducing the amount of information which is required in support of a marketing application means that greater responsibility rests with industry to report accurately and fairly on the various studies and trials which have been conducted and, where considered necessary, to provide ready access to supporting data. Professor Baume deemed it appropriate, and the Government has accepted, that companies should be penalised should they fail to honour this greater trust. </PARA>
<PARA>Another important aspect of the proposed reforms relates to access to unapproved drugs. In the case of patients who are seriously ill with a life-threatening disease it is proposed to leave the use of unapproved products to the patient and his or her practitioner to determine. In other cases the limitations on access are to be reduced. It is also intended to more widely delegate the authority for approving the supply of unapproved drugs. A number of amendments have been necessary to accommodate these changes. </PARA>
<PARA>It is intended that companies should be able to make, without prior approval, certain changes to the information provided to doctors concerning a drug. These are safety related changes, where it is important that the company make the changes as quickly as possible. Amendment to the registration procedures is sought for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the changes made to accommodate Professor Baume's recommendations, a further amendment has been included in this Bill. This relates to certain labelling requirements presently applying to registrable therapeutic goods that are intended for export only. The Bill removes the need for sponsors of such goods to comply with labelling requirements that have relevance only for the Australian market. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No 4) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 4) 1991 gives effect to a number of Budget initiatives which were announced in the 1991 Budget, some non-Budget initiatives and some amendments of a more minor nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The earnings credit allows, on an annual basis, maximum rate pensioners to accrue the value of their weekly income test free area up to $1,000. The credit is offset against earnings which would otherwise reduce pension under the income test. Once the credit is used up, normal income test provisions apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The earnings limit is to be indexed from the first pension payday in July 1992 so as to maintain the limit in real terms as an incentive for pensioners to take up casual, full-time or part-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 3) 1991 provided for the implementation of two initiatives relating to rent assistance. When introducing the (No 3) Bill, it was indicated that a further initiative relating to rent assistance would be included in a bill to be introduced later in the current Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, if a beneficiary under 60 years without children is receiving rent assistance and ceases to be entitled to his or her benefit for more than 4 weeks, he or she has to serve a 26 week waiting period to requalify for rent assistance. The No 3 Bill provided for this waiting period to be reduced to 18 weeks from 20 March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides that from 20 March 1992, for job search allowance recipients under 60 years without children, the allowable break in basic entitlement to income support before a person will have to serve another waiting period will be increased from 4 weeks to 6 weeks. Similarly, for newstart allowance recipients under 60 years and without children, the allowable break in basic entitlement to income support will be increased from 4 weeks to 13 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a person ceases to be entitled to benefit for no more than 6 weeks or 13 weeks as the case may be, he or she will be able to count the number of weeks already served whilst in receipt of benefit towards the 18 week waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also effect changes relating to the treatment of compensation payments from 20 March 1992. First, persons receiving certain social security pensions and benefits who are injured while doing part-time or low income work and who subsequently receive periodic compensation payments, will have their compensation treated under the normal income test rules. Secondly, sole parent pensions will be included in the group of social security payments subject to direct deduction as a result of the receipt of periodic compensation and a period of non-payment for receipt of lump sum compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where only one member of a couple receives income support, the maximum rate payable to him or her is the same as that for a single person. There is no clear justification for paying a higher basic rate of pension or benefit simply because the person's partner does not receive income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, for claims granted on or after 12 March 1992, the maximum pension or benefit entitlement of a member of a couple living with a partner who is not receiving a social security pension or benefit or similar payment will be the married rate of pension or half married rate of benefit. This limitation will also apply to the rate of pharmaceutical allowance payable to a member of a couple with a non-pensioner or beneficiary partner. These measures will not apply to existing pensioners or beneficiaries as at 11 March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payment of pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in November 1990 to offset the introduction of a charge for pharmaceutical benefits for persons who had previously received prescriptions free under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As an interim measure, the Government decided that certain persons were to be eligible for payment of advances of that allowance until 31 December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will extend the period in which advances of pharmaceutical allowance will be payable until 31 December 1993. The Bill will also remove the special assets test limit that previously operated for the payment of advances together with some modifications to simplify the advance payment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act permits the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to prepay social security benefits if a client's normal payday would fall on a public holiday. A prepayment of social security benefit made to a client who is later found not to have been entitled to the payment will, from 1 December 1991, be a recoverable overpayment under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make two beneficial amendments relating to child disability allowance. A person will be able to receive child disability allowance during periods when caring for a disabled child who is home `on leave' from an institution, even if the institution continues to receive family allowance for the child. Further, it will now be possible for payment of child disability allowance to be apportioned between two persons in cases where the care of a child is shared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the day of Royal Assent, penalties under the Social Security Act relating to fraud will be aligned with those applicable to similar offences under the Crimes Act. This emphasises the seriousness with which the Government views social security fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also from the day of Royal Assent, any copy of a determination by the Minister approving a scholarship or class of scholarships for the purposes of the Act will be subject to tabling in Parliament. This measure is in response to a concern made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills when it considered the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act provides for agreements between Australia and foreign countries relating to reciprocity in social security matters. Such agreements are incorporated into the Social Security Act as schedules to bring the Agreements into force so that they may modify the Act as appropriate. Agreements were signed with Ireland and Portugal on 8 April 1991 and 30 April 1991 respectively and will be inserted as schedules to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will also be made to the Act to revive the old reciprocal agreement between the United Kingdom and Australia. The old reciprocal agreement was omitted from the Act on the basis that a new Reciprocal Agreement had been signed by both countries and was to have been implemented by the beginning of 1991. However, as the United Kingdom has been unable to undertake all steps necessary to enable the new reciprocal Agreement to come into effect by that date, the old reciprocal agreement needs to be revived as an interim measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for some minor technical amendments to be made to the Social Security Act to enhance the efficiency of social security administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will be made to the Act to ensure that it accurately reflects the policy as it stood on 30 June 1991 in its predecessor, the Social Security Act 1947, before the latter's repeal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will also be made so as to clearly indicate that money which is exempted by the Minister from the operation of the deeming rules will not use up the deeming-free amount ($2,000 per person). Further, the Minister will have a power to nominate the date of effect of his decision to exempt specified money from the deeming rules so that arrears can be paid from that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act will be clarified so that the wind up of a managed investment fund through transfer of assets to another managed investment fund will constitute a realisation for the purposes of income assessment. This rule applies to market-linked investments and accruing return investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment will be made to the Act to allow a person holding a market linked investment, and the manager of that investment, to request the Secretary to determine the current rate of return on that investment with effect from the date on which the request was received, notwithstanding that the fund manager or investment product has not been specified in a notice in the Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments relating to job search and newstart allowances, the Aboriginal Employment Incentive Scheme, the rates of benefit payable where one member of a couple is in receipt of ABSTUDY, the indexation of pharmaceutical allowance, the reciprocal social security agreement between Australia and Malta and the rules relating to the portability of wives/widows pension for those women who have more than 10 years of Australian residence will also be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, a minor amendment will be made to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 to include the date of birth of a living spouse as one of the details that can be used in the data-matching process.  This will further enhance the effectiveness of that process. The Privacy Commissioner has indicated that he has no objection to the inclusion of this detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes amendments to Veterans' Affairs and associated legislation to give effect to a number of measures included in the Government's 1991 Budget package which impact on veterans. These measures have been developed to improve the quality of life and health care for veterans and war widows and to generally improve the administration and delivery of these benefits. I must emphasise, however, that many of the 1991 Budget measures assisting veterans do not require legislation but are being implemented by other means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some changes, such as the provision from 2 January 1992 of emergency short-term home relief for veterans and war widows, the choice of in-home respite care and veteran support networks, the expansion of the Financial Information Service for Pensioners, the extension, from 1 December 1991, of Repatriation treatment benefits to Australian Merchant Mariners of World War I and World War II on the same basis that applies to Australian war veterans and the increase in the rate of mileage allowance for veterans who use their own vehicles from 12.28 cents to 18.5 cents per kilometre, are being implemented through administrative arrangements or delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One other improvement to benefits announced in the Budget, the replacement of the telephone rental concession vouchers with the payment of a telephone allowance, will be included in legislation to be brought forward in the 1992 Autumn sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also contains proposed changes to give effect to a number of non-Budget measures. These relate to changes in the arrangements for payment of advances for pharmaceutical allowances, indexation of pharmaceutical allowance and changes to the operational areas in Schedule 2 to the Veterans' Entitlements Act to include the area of Iraq and Kuwait and to specify the periods during which certain areas are to be regarded as being operational.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, this Bill gives effect to the decision to extend the co-payment arrangements for pharmaceutical benefits under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from 1 January 1992. Some aspects of this decision do not require amendment of Veterans' Affairs legislation. The introduction of a patient contribution of $2.60 per prescription item requires an amendment to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is established in accordance with section 91 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I have already signed and arranged for the tabling of the instrument to effect this change to the Scheme. That change will of course be dependent on the passage of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative amendment is required, however, for the payment of a fortnightly pharmaceutical allowance to offset the patient contribution. The Bill provides for this. It also includes proposed amendments to the National Health Act to ensure that existing safety net provisions will extend to Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are an extension of the patient contribution scheme introduced in 1990 in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to address some of the problems associated with over-prescribing and over-supply of medication and to encourage sensible drug use throughout the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One other important change contained in the Bill is the provision for the maximum amount of earnings credit applicable to the ordinary income test, currently fixed at $1,000 per annum, to be indexed annually in line with movements in the consumer price index. Indexation of this amount will commence from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the provisions of this Bill, together with those changes which are proceeding by other means, represent an important step forward in the provision of benefits to veterans and widows and in the administration of those benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost for indexation of the earnings credit account balance is nil in 1992/3, $20,000 in 1993/94 and $20,000 in 1994/5. The extension of the co-payment arrangements to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the corresponding payment of the pharmaceutical allowance will cost $1.1m in 1991/92,  with subsequent savings of $10.5m in 1992/93, $11.4m in 1993/94 and $12.2m in 1994/95. The extension of the system for payment of advance pharmaceutical allowance, including advance payments to persons eligible for repatriation pharmaceutical benefits, will be $20,500 in 1991/92, $19,000 in 1992/93 and $8,500 in 1993/94. The changes to the indexation arrangements for pharmaceutical allowance, the concessional beneficiary charge and the general patient reduced charge are likely to result in net savings of more than $1m. The financial implications of the changes to the operational areas are negligible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week, during House of Representatives Question Time, the Minister for Land Transport, Bob Brown, accused me and my National Party Senate colleague Bill O'Chee of outlandish statements and a deliberate misrepresentation over the new charges to apply to heavy vehicle registration under the National Road Transport Commission. Among other things, Minister Brown questioned our credibility, our integrity and our honesty and described our campaign to highlight the new charging structure as one of the most appalling exercises in political misrepresentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must first place on record the fact that Senator O'Chee and I have worked vigorously and with gusto in raising the public awareness of the new charging structure. We have been in constant consultation with road transport industry representatives throughout the country and I have written to hundreds of shire councils, farmer organisations and media groups outlining the implications of the new charging structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures I have been quoting are derived solely from the working group's recommendations, which were noted but not endorsed at the July Special Premiers Conference.  These figures show a two-stage charging system, with the first phase to be implemented from July 1993 to 1995, and the second phase to come in from July 1995 to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these figures it would cost $7,750 to register a six-axle articulated truck from July 1993 to July 1995 and the charges would go up to $14,400 from July 1995 for a typical road transport vehicle.  As these figures are contained in the report released by the working group, I presume the Minister would not wish to contradict these figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Minister who has engaged in misrepresentation.  In a press release on 23 May 1991 Mr Brown said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Interstate Commission report into road user charging would not become the blueprint for Government reform in the land transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us compare that with the hard reality.  Clause 20(3) of the Special Premiers Conference agreement signed on 30 July 1991 states that the National Road Transport Commission, in determining charges, is `to use a common methodology, initially based on the model employed by the Inter-state Commission in its 1990 report but enhanced with further research currently being undertaken by the Australian Road Research Board'. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us contrast the two statements. In May, in a completely misleading statement, the Minister said that the Inter-State Commission report into road user charging would not&mdash;I emphasise `not'&mdash;become the blueprint for government charges. Just one month later, the Special Premiers Conference, in line with recommendations from the officials of the working committee, wrote the Inter-State Commission's methodology  into the agreement as a blueprint. The facts are clear. There is no doubt who is misleading the public and the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working group's figures were devised using a complicated formula based on three factors: using a common methodology, initially based on the model employed by the ISC in its 1990 report, but enhanced by further research currently being undertaken by the Australian Road Research Board;  initially adopting the expenditure allocation template to be endorsed by Austroads in the pay-go process;  and making use of the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on motor vehicle use of road task data, with appropriate upgrading as a source of this data. This formula was agreed to at the July Special Premiers Conference. In fact, full cost recovery is required except for road trains, which may attract a 50 per cent discount to the year 2000. In the Senate on 15 October, Senator Collins representing Mr Brown responded to a question from me by saying that the National Road Transport Commission would recommend charges by March 1992 to apply no later than January 1993 and that full cost recovery would be phased in by 1 July 1995, and 1 July 2000 for road trains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are clear. Clause 2 of the Special Premiers Conference agreement provides that `charging principles' means to fully recover distributed road costs while minimising over-recovering from any vehicle class, thereby achieving full recovery of all road costs. Clause 20 (3) provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Commission in recommending road charges and a road use charge to the Ministerial Council shall ensure that by no later than July 1, 1995 the principles it recommends comply with the charging principles, and recover fully the road costs of all vehicles based on average annual distance travelled, except for road trains, which are to receive concessions of up to 50 per cent of full cost recovery mass distance charges. Road train charges should achieve full cost recovery by July 1, 2000 at the latest.</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no doubt that for almost all vehicles full cost recovery is to be achieved by July 1995. Moreover, in achieving full cost recovery there is absolutely no doubt that the National Road Transport Commission is constrained to use pay-go, use the ISC methodology, use the road expenditure allocation endorsed by Austroads and use Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week Mr Brown said that the total charge for six-axle articulated trucks would be between $7,000 and $8,000. If the Minister is fair dinkum about these charges, let him make a ministerial statement and provide me with a written assurance that his figures are right. If he fails to do this, I and the trucking industry will assume that my figures are correct. Will the total charge for a 42.5-tonne six-axle truck be $7,000 or $8,000 or will it be $14,400 in 1995? These are the questions that Mr Brown has to answer in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Special Premiers Conference communique, page 18, fourth dot point, full cost recovery mass distance charges should be implemented with up to 50 per cent discount by July 1995 at the latest and be fully implemented by July 2000 at the latest. Under this charging structure the phase one charge from 1993 is to be $11,250. From 1995 the phase two charge will be $22,500 and the full figure of $46,400 is to be achieved by July 2000 at the latest. The trucking industry would love Mr Brown to indicate right here and now that those charges, as recommended to the Special Premiers Conference, will not be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I publicly challenge Mr Brown to tell us exactly what the charges will be. We know that the National Road Transport Commission will ultimately set the charges, but, in our opinion, the charges are locked in: they are based on ISC methodology which has been used by the working group to come up with its figures. The trucking industry is very cynical of Mr Brown and so too will be the public of Australia unless he can clarify this matter once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory Government has refused to come into the scheme because it knows the full implications of the charging structure and what they will mean for the Northern Territory. The trucking industry recently organised a series of meetings to air its concerns about the proposed charges. The meetings were held in country New South Wales, attracting 500 trucking operators. They were organised by an alliance of the New South Wales Road Transport Association, the New South Wales branch of the Transport Workers Union of Australia, the New South Wales Farmers Association, the Long Distance Road Transport Association, the Livestock Transporters Association of New South Wales, and the National Transport Federation.  Surely, if everything was so sweet and rosy these organisations would not be holding such crisis meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now time for Mr Brown to tell us honestly whether those charges will be $7,000, as he said in the House of Representatives, or whether those charges will be in the second phase of up to $14,400. But Mr Brown can no longer sit there and not give a clear definition of where those charges will end up when full cost recovery is implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, prior to the adjournment of the Senate, I was pointing out the considerable pressure coming from the Opposition in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, has finally come good with a definitive paper on the hardship clauses and the actual meaning of the liquid assets test. I must admit that he has done a fairly good job of that, and I am willing to support the Bill because I believe we now have a far more lenient hardship clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important aspect concerns amounts of money held in business accounts. The Minister's guidelines state that amounts held in such accounts are treated as liquid assets, except where the person can demonstrate that the funds are required for an essential and usual expenditure in operating a farm or business. This will mean a tremendous amount to small business and it will mean an incredibly lighter assets test burden for farmers. It will mean that working capital will be included. For instance, because it has not been stipulated that amounts from the previous year will be the only ones accepted as exemptions from liquid assets, if a farmer has not put superphosphate on his farm for several years it will certainly be considered as an essential expenditure if that were to be done in the following year, when the farmer would be looking towards the need for that extra fertilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that; superannuation lump sums and other payments will not be included as liquid assets. So the small businessman or farmer will not have to sell these assets to be able to apply for the hardship clauses. We could go through the whole list of assets that would not have to be sold prior to a farmer being able to apply for assistance under the hardship clause, but it really amounts to machinery, stock and anything applying to the business that is necessary for the running of that business or farm. That is why it was of concern to me when I heard Senator Harradine say that he believed that some farms would have to be sold before eligibility for the hardship clause was triggered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having dealt with the assets test for the family allowance, I would now like to spend just a very short time on the fifth point of my speech which covers the attempt to bring independent young persons into the Austudy entitlement. The Government knows that the term `independent young persons' is just a very nice way of referring to homeless youth. The situation has not been made better in the last few years, particularly following the promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that no child would be living in poverty after 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the number of homeless youths is increasing daily. We know that there have been homeless youths for some time. Indeed, I was chairman of a committee that looked into this very sad situation. I do not think that in the 16 years that I have been a member of the Senate, I have sat on a committee in the social welfare area that has really affected me quite so much as that committee which looked into homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the Government has created homeless youth. The problem certainly existed when we were in government. No government can legislate for good parents. But the Government has done nothing following both the Burdekin report and our report, and the situation continues to get worse. Indeed, in the present situation, where we are in the middle of this depression we had to have, the numbers are only increasing. The Government's recognition of that is to try to bring these homeless youths into the Austudy entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not quite sure whether the Minister really understands the situation of homeless youths. He ought to go to the Kings Cross area and the shelters, follow them up and do as our committee did&mdash;go around every State in the Commonwealth and have a look at what these children are doing. Even though 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds may have grown up pretty quickly because they have been thrown out of their homes, they are still basically very young and inexperienced youths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thing they lack is health care; they do not know how to go about it. Evidence given to us when we were in the shelters in Kings Cross, Sydney, was, `Please don't open any more shelters in Kings Cross'. I believe that any responsible person in charge of one of those shelters would also have given us that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One person in charge of a shelter there said, `We do not take in any youth coming into the Cross now who does not originate from the Cross. We take him to a shelter outside the Cross because once he is established in the Cross he will not leave it'. This gentleman told us that he is really just there to pick up the pieces because the youths who work in the Cross do not even bother to get their unemployment benefits. Even though that unemployment benefit is no longer an entitlement for them, they are not even interested in going down and collecting the Jobsearch allowance and things like that as a substitute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These young people find that prostitution and other methods of getting money are much easier. They earn far greater amounts of money than the paltry amounts&mdash;this is how it was put to us&mdash;`that you offer them and unemployment benefits are of no use to them and they do not bother to go down'. The shelters are only there when the whole of the prostitution racket gets on top of these young people and they fall to pieces;  that is when the shelters take over and nurse them back to sanity. Once they step foot outside that shelter again, they are into it once more. The situation there is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe any of these young people would run away from home without unjust cause, for the reason that life on the street is far too difficult. We are led to understand that every one of those homeless youths who had been on the street for any length of time had been thrown out of their homes. I have said before in this chamber that perhaps the most horrifying story we were told was of a young brother and sister, younger than 15, who went home from school one afternoon to find that mum and the de facto father had just packed up and left the house, and there was no-one there to look after them. They went back to the school and slept under the school and in the school grounds until the teacher realised something was wrong and had them taken into care. One cannot legislate for good parents. I questioned one mother and asked her where her 15-year-old daughter was, and all she said to me was, `Don't talk about it; I don't want to know. My nerves won't take it'. We do not know what pressures that mother was under, but we do know that the daughter was under far greater pressures out on the streets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the Minister believes that great numbers of these homeless youths will take up this Austudy entitlement or the entitlements being offered them under that scheme. I think one has to go a little further in the inquiries into homeless youth because the majority of them would not even contemplate returning to education or taking up those entitlements. We have to get at them before they reach that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that our Committee did not bring forward any great recommendations that could possibly overcome the situation. We did try to bring forward recommendations on accommodation, because accommodation seemed to be the main assistance that they were requiring, and the accommodation that they were living in, particularly around the Cross, was unbelievably bad. If the Minister could start with the very basics of their needs&mdash;accommodation and health&mdash;and spend some money in those areas, I think far more homeless youths would be interested in accepting that sort of assistance. The Austudy entitlement is a wonderful thing, if only they would take it up, but I believe the numbers who will do that are very few and far between. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am speaking only briefly on this Bill. There has been great concern about the hardship clauses. I will be following the committee stage in detail because I believe the hardship clauses are terribly important. On the hardship clauses of the family allowance assets test, I support very thoroughly the shadow Minister's amendment that the two-year restriction or time limit on those hardship clauses should be done away with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot say the recession in the rural community will last for only two years. Australia is a big country. In five years time there could be a dreadful drought and those hardship clauses must apply if that sort of thing occurs again. I hope that business will be able to recover from the recession in two years time, because we will be in government by then and I am sure we will be able to do something about it. In regard to the rural community, not even our government can say that there will not be another drought. Therefore, I support the shadow Minister's amendment on the abolition of the two-year clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief remarks on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, particularly in relation to the hardship provisions that Senator Walters referred to in her closing remarks. As a result of negotiation and consultation in the past two or three weeks, progress has been made on the hardship provisions <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>and whether a two-year limitation should be placed on their application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) on the role he has played in addressing the many genuine concerns expressed around Australia about how the assets test will apply and how it will affect rural communities in particular. I congratulate the Minister on being very ready to discuss this matter and to ensure that the guidelines for the hardship provisions take into account these very many concerns. Of course, I recognise the role played by our shadow minister, Senator Alston, in negotiating these hardship provisions in consultation with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what we have been informed so far, we know that the hardship provisions will be very workable. They will recognise the reality out in the rural areas. The guidelines will be published and they will be tabled in this place. Through the normal channels of constituency inquiries, we will be able to monitor the effectiveness of those guidelines and, therefore, the effectiveness of the hardship provisions in rural Australia as they come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These hardship provisions are quite vital when we are bringing in an assets test. There now seems to be a bipartisan agreement that any form of Federal income redistribution, be it welfare or the family allowance supplement, needs to be targeted. As a nation, we cannot afford to hand out family allowances and other benefits to Australians who do not need them. It is important that we target income assistance to those people who are in genuine need. Using measures such as the assets test and the income test is one of the few ways in which we can achieve that targeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as we all know, no matter where we set the limit on any income level or assets test&mdash;$300,000 or $600,000 or, in the case of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), $2m; the figures become arbitrary&mdash;the value of farms and the depreciation in the value of farms and so forth becomes an issue. So it is vital to have hardship provisions which are workable. As I said, due to the negotiations that have taken place in the past three weeks, that has been achieved to a large extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I recognise the contribution that my colleague Wilson Tuckey has made in these negotiations. He has put a lot of pressure on members of our Party and he has reflected the views of many people in his constituency. From my point of view, this process has been a very good example of how the party structure can work&mdash;and I am sure that I speak for honourable senators on the other side of the chamber&mdash;if we have political parties that have an active membership and active cooperation between parliamentary members and lay members. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>We in the Liberal Party have received feedback from very many rural members, particularly in the O'Connor electorate. I make special mention of the president of the O'Connor division, Mr Murray Nixon, who has been very active in ensuring that Liberal Party senators in Western Australia are aware of the severe hardship in the rural areas of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about this two-year limit, as Senator Walters said, is that it is impossible for us to judge whether this rural recession&mdash;or rural depression&mdash;will come to an end in two years' time. The important point is, as Dorothea Mackellar said in her poem, that Australia is a wide brown land, and there is always a drought, a famine, a flood or a fire that affects some part of rural Australia. If these hardship provisions prove to be workable, which I am sure we can make happen across party lines, there is no reason to apply an arbitrary two-year limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has spoken about a review after two years. I suggest that if we monitor these hardship provisions on a day by day basis, as cases come before us, that review can be on an ongoing basis and there is no need to say, `Let's review it in two years'. I have yet to hear the Minister give a good reason why there should be this two-year limit; I am sure he will refer to it in his closing remarks. I will certainly be supporting the shadow Minister's amendment to get rid of that two-year limit and ensure that the Parliament reviews the workings of the hardship provisions on an ongoing basis&mdash;whether it be after a year, two years, three years, four years or a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reiterating my congratulations and support for the sterling efforts of the Minister and the shadow Minister in making this Bill workable and meeting the interests of the very many people living in rural Australia who are suffering severe hardship in the current recession. </PARA>

There are obvious ways we can tell that it is different. In any event, the amount is now not $60,000, it is about $62,000, and there are amounts to be included for children. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of honourable senators&mdash;I would not be exhaustive about this but including Senator Patterson and Senator Walters&mdash;spoke about the problems of the young homeless. I have been out to talk to young homeless people, I must concede not in every capital, only in Sydney and Melbourne, and Senator Walters is quite right. That is why the number of people receiving the allowance we have for them is so small compared with the number of children in this difficulty. Many of them are reluctant to approach any form of government because they fear authority. Many of the younger ones mostly fear being sent home and tend to shy away from government interference as they see it, and that will be a real problem for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at how to address their problems one of the difficulties that is very quickly discovered is that even if they do receive any form of government allowance they do not have much in the way of life skills, having just left home at a very young age and, not having been taught these things, the art of financial survival has escaped them. Therefore, when they receive payments, they tend to blow them in the first day or two days and then are in some difficulty. So by attempting to pay them weekly we might in some way get around that part of the problem. We will make our financial information service available to them as well as to age pensioners and sole parent pensioners and, hopefully, they can have some budgeting done for them if we can get them that far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By expanding the number of social workers in social security I hope we can target young homeless much more than we have in the past.

The rural community in particular is facing a hard time because not only does it have to deal with the recession but also it is faced with a downturn in some commodity prices, which makes life very difficult. So we are primarily about assisting those who are in small business. It is beyond me completely how one can exclude the family farm and even pretend that there is some form of targeting.

<PARA>These amendments relate to the proposed reduction from 26 to 18 weeks in the waiting period for various benefits and entitlements. For the first time, it is proposed to extend a rent assistance entitlement to the young homeless. I want to make it clear in moving these amendments that the Opposition is supportive of the extension of the entitlement for rent assistance to that group. But we do not accept the arguments advanced by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in relation to the reduction in waiting periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just say that I think the Minister has withstood a great deal of pressure from various quarters. The argument seems to proceed on the basis that, because we are in a recession, somehow there is a more urgent need to make benefits available at an earlier time. The logic of that argument escapes me. It is perfectly clear that, as a result of this deliberate recession, many hundreds of thousands of people are in need of income support and will, therefore, have entitlements in due course. But it does not follow that the financial situation of these people has deteriorated any more so than in normal times. Therefore, the concept of waiting periods ought to be a valid one through good times and bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as the Minister says, there is a sufficient ability to isolate effectively from the outset a category of people who, it is said, are in urgent need of rent assistance, it does not make sense logically for the Government to be proposing a reduction from 26 to 18 weeks. I am sure the Australian Democrats will argue that everyone ought to be entitled to everything immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the Government amendment has all the hallmarks of simply genuflecting in a particular direction so that the Government is able to claim that it is doing something in this regard. But the amendment does not appeal to us. We are not convinced that there is that need. Indeed, various other forms of assistance are available to people. The concept of a waiting period is deliberately structured in such a way that it is only after a certain period that one is regarded as being in need of assistance. Presumably one has moved from being a short term temporary recipient to having every prospect of being a permanent recipient. It is in those circumstances that the view is taken that such people ought to be given assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be a better way of tackling the whole problem. We could try to target people from the outset rather than extending rent assistance across the board, irrespective of need. Whilst there may well be some people who are in dire straits from the outset, there will equally be some people who are not. I have certainly had people say to me, `It is all a bit odd, you know. I was on the unemployment benefit for six months and then I got a bonus'. They did not quite understand what it was. All they knew was that an extra amount was paid to them. It turns out that that extra amount is rent assistance. So the logic escapes even many of the recipients. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That being the case, I think there is an argument for examining the actual needs of particular people.

A number of my colleagues have pointed out that hardship will endure well beyond the two-year period which, presumably, is meant to be a proxy for the current recession. We all hope that it will be well and truly over before the end of next year; nonetheless, there has to be a recognition that there will always be people in conditions of hardship somewhere around the country at some time for various reasons&mdash;whether cyclical downturn, a fall in particular commodity prices or any other reason. </PARA>

If the Minister were seeking to justify two years, he would be saying, `There is no need for a review. There is no need to talk about "initially". We are putting in two years for a very good reason, and this is it'. He has not said that. He has basically said, `This is stage one. We will have a think about it later'.

He should, therefore, make the most of the plaudits that have been delivered to him from this side of the chamber and, presumably, elsewhere outside.

I have seen rain shadows in a drought that have a radius of about 80 kilometres or 50 miles. That can happen for the whole year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I ask the Minister a couple of questions, I say this by way of preface: we are here dealing to a large extent with the family farm and families on farms in Australia. Those families exist generally without subsidies because of our agricultural policies. I was a member of a recent delegation to the EC. As our principal mission, we had to show the problems that will emerge, both for the EC and for ourselves, and indeed for access by third countries, from the common agricultural policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that that policy subsidises production.  There is a move now, including by the EC Commissioner responsible, Mr McSharry, that that perhaps should not be the case and that one should look at the need for income support for family farms in Europe. There are a number of reasons for that, not the least of which, of course, is that without subsidies farm families will have to move to cities where there are no jobs.  Also, of course, the farmers are the manicurists of the environment and in that respect, if that were to occur, there would be some degree of devastation in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing, of course, will apply here. I think we have to take that broad view when considering the question that is currently before us. We also have to remind ourselves of the fact that family allowances were never intended to be a social security welfare measure. They were intended, as has been stated time and time again, both by Labor and Liberal governments, to be part of the tax transfer system which recognises that a family with dependent children, at whatever level of income, has outgoings, including outgoings for indirect taxes, which are far greater than for families without children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people on the farms who are now battling because of the recession and because of drought and other aspects are behind the eight ball at the present moment.  Am I correct in stating that in 1991 a family with four children is losing $49.60 per fortnight compared with the real value of the original 1976 family allowance payment?  Those are the figures that I have developed and I would like to have them confirmed. If that is so, they are starting well behind the eight ball. The result will be that a number of families will be forced to sell their farms to become eligible under the current hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These hardship provisions take account, do they not, of assets but that the family concerned has to run the gauntlet of the income test as well?

I know that his position is very difficult indeed.

May I briefly state the history of this payment, as I did in my earlier remarks. Child endowment was a direct tax transfer in full recognition that the family with children had more expenses than the family without children.  If it had remained as child endowment, I doubt whether the Government would be introducing this legislation. Indeed, I doubt whether it would have introduced an income test on the family allowance. With the best intentions in the world, the Fraser Government altered child endowment to make it family allowance so that the mother, who is the primary carer for children, would actually get in her hand the dollars that we believed were needed for the benefit of children.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, we believe they are difficult to comply with and difficult to gain anything worthwhile from. Perhaps it is because of something that Senator Panizza was saying, and something that is true. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) may well believe that the present recession in the rural areas of Australia will retreat in the near future and in two years time hardship provisions may not be necessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reiterate some of the comments that have been made. It is beyond me why a sunset clause is included in the legislation. Hardship, as we know and as I mentioned in my speech during the second reading stage, can occur in good times and bad times. It can occur within a particular industry when world commodity prices are high and it can occur because of fire, flood and a whole host of different reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address a number of questions to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) about the hardship provisions. I raised these in my speech in the second reading stage last night. I have to acknowledge that the hardship provisions have come a long way from where they were a fortnight or so ago. The first point I want to raise relates to shareholdings in public companies which are suppliers of products to the people in a specific industry. In Western Australia&mdash;I believe this applies in other States where there are monopolies in the manufacture of fertiliser&mdash;many farmers have very small shareholdings in Wesfarmers Ltd, for example. They can range from $500 to $5,000. The shareholders get a substantial rebate in the price of the fertiliser because they hold shares in the company. More importantly, it allows the farmers to keep control of the operation of the fertiliser works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exactly the same situation applies to another Western Australian company&mdash;I could go through a number&mdash;S B S Rural Ltd, which was established by virtue of the action of farmers to help themselves. Originally it was a private company, but it is now a public company. Once again, we have a situation where a large percentage of the farmers have a small shareholding in the company. The principal role of those companies, particularly  S B S, is to supply farm merchandise. It would seem to me that, because a small investment has been made in those companies so that there can be some competition in the marketplace with the pastoral houses and others, it would be totally counterproductive to force people to quit those shares to become entitled to the family allowance. As I said before with regard to the fertiliser works, it would stop farmers getting the rebates they get when they trade with those companies and it would be part of the process of moving control of the companies out of the hands of the people who utilise them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise that point with the Minister. I make a plea to him that these situations be taken into consideration in the further development of the guidelines; otherwise it will be counterproductive in the long term. These are not shares from which people get huge dividends; the main benefit is in the rebate for trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I want to raise relates to the IEDs. As I said last night, I accept that IEDs are a realisable asset. However, I ask that consideration be given to the fact that, in times of drought, when people are forced to sell stock they may put the realisation from those sales into IEDs for the purpose of restocking. I ask that that be considered and that we not have a situation where IEDs used for such a purpose have to be realised; otherwise the purpose&mdash;the practice that has been used on a number of occasions&mdash;would be defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I want to put to the Minister relates to the situation which exists in relation to education. There are examples&mdash;I happen to be one of them&mdash;where people put aside money, over a number of years, for the education of their children. Many people have no other choice, because of their geographical isolation, than to educate their children through the private school system.  If people have designated funds for the education of their children in later years&mdash;children who are often seriously disadvantaged in terms of the education system&mdash;I think it would be totally wrong if those funds were to be considered a realisable asset. I request that the Minister give consideration in the guidelines to allowing any moneys that have been set aside and designated for education purposes not to be considered as part of realisable assets. </PARA>

It is not as though every proposal I bring in gets up. I wish it did, but I have not found a way to achieve that yet&mdash;nor can anyone else; we are all in the same boat. So the proposals honourable senators see before them are not necessarily those that I thought would be perfectly appropriate. I have to balance priorities within the portfolio and the ERC has to balance its priorities across government. So while I can acknowledge what Senator Harradine and Senator Walters have said&mdash;it is undoubtedly valid&mdash;at the end of the day we still come back to where the priorities lie in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what we have done here is about the best that can be done. As soon as an income test was put on the family allowance, the pristine nature of its simply being a transfer payment and therefore not subject to any form of targeting was lost. The battle was lost when that was done. From my point of view, when I am trying to frame a social security budget which will give some relief to the rural community&mdash;essentially that is what we are talking about; more so than small business&mdash;and I have to come up with a balance, I think I would rather be looking at an assets test at $600,000 or more, with a hardship provision for people with high assets who are nonetheless income poor, earning less than $13,000 or whatever the figure is in here;  it is a pretty low figure. I think that is about as fair a proposal as we can come up with. It is not what I would advocate in an ideal world but, as honourable senators are only too well aware, this is not an ideal world. This is a compromise, but it is, nonetheless, as fair a compromise as I could come up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the comments of Senator Panizza and Senator Bell about the two-year limit, it still comes back to what I am talking about: a question of balance. These are only some of the provisions we will put up to assist farmers. Honourable senators should appreciate that when we resume there will be amendments to the next social security Bill that will go further and involve the RAS scheme and assessments there, which will mean assistance for another couple of thousand farmers. We are talking about quite radical changes to the social security system. They are not minor. The next lot of proposals actually change the definition of unemployment, which is about as fundamental a change as one can get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally enough, the economic Ministers are concerned to ensure that the changes that, if you like, undermine what has been a longstanding principle do not lead towards a further undermining of the system. So, where we get a hardship provision that in certain circumstances allows for the income test on family allowance, for example, to be virtually disregarded, there are those who are concerned that there is an inevitable flow-on effect and that income testing, which is so important as a basis in social security, can suffer. So there is a concern to ensure that there is a two-year limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that I would not pretend to nominate two years as marking the end of the rural recession. If we are talking about the recession at large, I hope it is over a long time before then; but I am not really sure about the rural recession. These are the reasons why the Government regarded it as quite important to have a two-year sunset clause&mdash;to see how it worked and then review it. I agreed in the end that this was a fair thing to argue for. Had I not been prepared to accept those kinds of concerns from economic Ministers during the Budget deliberations, honourable senators would not have these proposals before them. So I am caught betwixt and between. I cannot back off on this question of two years. I am bound to stick with it, and the Committee will have to divide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. It is very difficult to just look behind a public company to see where these exceptions would be made. I also think that there are probably definitional problems. One difficulty is that when hardship provisions are introduced they have to operate consistently and across the board. If they do not, not only is their administration a nightmare but we get into all sorts of problems with people not understanding the rulings.

That happens right across Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that I will comment on that. Right across the board families make provisions for their future, be it education or other things. All sorts of Australian families have to change their plans because their circumstances alter. I do not think that there is any proper way of saying that families in rural Australia can put all that aside because I have no doubt that they are dipping into those funds now. It is not as if every family has money that is kept aside for school fees and it stays there forever in perfect condition until the children go to school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting in the operation of this test that people can prepay, which many families do. If they wanted to, or if they are of a mind to and they are determined that they will never vary their intentions regarding this money that they put aside, they can prepay it. I admit that is difficult if a child is just born, but in many cases people would be able to do it. I am not as sympathetic and I do not think that I can make Senator Crane a promise regarding that proposal. It would be very hard to implement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equalisation funds was another matter that Senator Crane raised. These funds will be counted but once spent on restocking, hardship provisions can apply. So I do not think that is such a great problem in any event. If we have the money today and it has to get spent on restocking, once it is restocked people can apply and get the payment. I am not certain that will be all that great a problem because it is really only a question of timing. Once that is understood, I do not believe that it will be such a great problem. </PARA>

Farmers are obviously different in some respects from other people; they live a different life to the one I lead. It is obviously a tough life and at the moment it is tougher than usual. But the idea that all farmers can put aside funds and always stick to what they put those funds aside for is really the same as for anyone else in a business; it does not always work that way. It is hard for us to give a general rule when, even on farms, it does not always work that way. I find that idea very hard to implement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The essential test with IEDs or anything else is whether people can get at the money. It is liquid if they can get at it. I do not know the details; I would not pretend to. If people are in a situation where the money is tied up and they cannot get at it for a period but, at the end of it they can get it and restock, I do not have a problem with what Senator Crane is saying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I will answer that part of the question relating to tariffs. I will allow that to occur in other debates with other Ministers. I would not pretend to have it within my portfolio, and my colleagues look too closely over my shoulder whenever I seek to comment outside it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Lees asks why we do not support our farmers through the social security system, the first thing that should be noted is that there are about 4,000 farmers and their spouses on social security benefits, mainly JSA, at the moment. It is not as if it can be claimed that there are none; there are quite a few. The purpose of the exercise today is to increase the number, and it will be further increased in two weeks time. That does not in any way encompass the numbers of people who are getting the family allowance supplement; there are a lot of people in that category. So I do not think it is fair to say that we do not support them through it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, and I mentioned this earlier, what still has to be decided is whether or not it would be economically sensible to allow the payment of social security benefits to keep people on the land if their farms are not viable. There must always be a judgment made about that. It is not a judgment that should be made by my Department for the reason that it does not have that kind of expertise. That is why, in the legislation we will be dealing with in the week after next, it will be the people within the RAS scheme who will make these decisions rather than the Department. I was quite insistent about that. It is not an expertise we have, nor is it one we would seek to acquire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a threshold question there that has to be answered. If we answered it by saying that it would not matter whether or not the farms were viable in the long term, and we simply paid the unemployment benefit, I do not think that would be to Australia's advantage. Rather, Social Security has to be concerned with individuals and we are certainly living up to those obligations with the 4,000 who are receiving payment now and the extras who will receive it as a result of this legislation and the next piece of legislation. </PARA>

However, clause 14 provides that a person will be eligible for that education entry payment if the person is a sole parent pensioner and is qualified to receive an education supplement under the Austudy eligibility requirements for full time study, whereas the explanatory memorandum suggests that the EEP will be available for both full time and part time study.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just state finally why the Democrats will be opposing clause 38. This particular assets test is the one we have problems with. To continue with what the Minister was saying earlier, targeting is desirable as long as we do not target to the point where we are cutting out people in need. I see no problem at all with an assets test that talks about luxury assets, and assets that can be easily realised at a time of need so that one can have the cash necessary, but to include the tools of trade for farms and small business is not desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have heard from many speakers, the farming community is in a situation where it cannot borrow any further and it certainly cannot sell off a paddock here and a paddock there to put food on the table. We are getting to the point where many very viable farms are being let go and many families are being forced off the land into cities to simply add to unemployment queues. While I do acknowledge that there at least has been some movement by the Government on hardship provisions, some recognition that we do have a major problem in rural Australia, I still do not believe that the Government understands that its free market policies have been causing most of these difficulties. The farmers are not to blame. At last it is nice to see in some of our major dailies some recognition of the fact that government policies are causing these problems. I will quote very briefly from an article by Russell Mathews in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Free-market policies are killing the Australian economy and causing hardship and financial ruin for millions of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial system is in tatters as a result of its own greed and extravagant lending policies, carrying the fortunes of hundreds of thousands of farmers, small businesses, home owners, superannuants and investors with it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I really acknowledged this when I was summing up at the end of the second reading debate. If we were to exclude the family farm from the assets test, there would be no point in having an assets test at all. Just because the farm is owned by a family does not make it a good, bad or indifferent farm. Farms will obviously vary depending on location and on the quality of management. In any event, as I think Senator O'Chee pointed out, the way this legislation is written, excluding the family farm would not help those that are set up as companies, and many of them are. Apart from that, basically what Senator Lees seeks to do here is undermine the concept of the test with which we have just agreed. I cannot accept that.</PARA></TALK.START>

In South Australia I have 40 or 50 cases where the value was accepted at the time of application and Austudy was paid. In one case, it was nearly two years before the family's property was revalued and they now owe over $6,000, which they are being forced to pay back. I am trying to make sure that we have it on the record that, if a valuation is accepted&mdash;in other words, the farm family self-values and someone in the office picks up the valuation and says, `Right, we start paying the family allowance'&mdash;and some time down the track the farm is revalued by AVO, the family does not have to pay the allowance back. The Department does spot checks such as on Austudy. This is what alerted me to the problem. The AVO valuations in South Australia are consistently well above State valuations and local council valuations. In good faith, many hundreds of people have been caught out by a revaluation that is significantly higher. We need to get it on the record here that, once someone has accepted the valuation and family allowance is paid, down the track&mdash;no matter how many months later the property is revalued&mdash;there is no question that the family ever has to pay the allowance back.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because this is not the time to debate the question apropos of clause 38M and proposed clause 38B. Let me place on record what former Senator Grimes said on 12 April 1983 at the National Economic Summit Conference:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is often forgotten, however, that the family allowances are not and were never meant to be a welfare program in the strict sense. Rather, they are designed to achieve a broad measure of equity in the tax transfer system between those with and those without dependent children. They recognise that at any level of income those with children face higher costs than those without.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seen in this light, family allowances offset to some extent the tax liabilities of those with children so that their net contribution to revenue is reduced in reflection of their lesser ability to pay. Immediately prior to 1976 this was achieved by the dependent child tax rebate. I point out that no one at that stage had ever suggested that this tax rebate should be means tested.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that should be on the record. I understand what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) said. I have read between the lines and appreciate what he has said. But I really do feel that we are digging a big hole for ourselves here. If or when the GST comes in&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the GST comes in, the action that is now taken which is undermining that principle so clearly announced by the then Minister will result in large numbers of families paying extra by virtue of the fact that this family allowance measure is not regarded as a tax transfer system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning, Dr Hewson proposes targeting offsetting provisions only to those who are presumably eligible for FAS&mdash;all other families can go to blazes by the sounds of it. I do not want to pre-empt what he might say next week, I think it is, when the Opposition will make some announcement. But I do believe that what is being done here is setting a precedent for a further undermining of that principle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although it does not follow on logically from the remarks made by Senator Harradine, and although we have had indications from the coalition that it will not be supporting this amendment by Senator Lees, perhaps a last ditch attempt might not be misplaced to convince the coalition that to support this would not be inconsistent with the policies and philosophies it has espoused in other places at other times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees used the analogy of the problems with valuations with regard to Austudy qualifications from the AVO. I should like to use the analogy of Austudy again in pointing out to the coalition that its shadow Minister for education, Dr Kemp, received considerable publicity recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kemp said a Coalition government would temporarily suspend the assets test for families in "extreme economic hardship".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It would mainly apply to farm families," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>In saying that, Dr Kemp received immediate and considerable support from the Executive Director of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Rick Farley, and some several column inches of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> were devoted to saying what a good idea this was and how wonderful it would be. But that was a promise which could only be delivered by the coalition when in government. The coalition had that opportunity to deliver that very policy some six or so months ago and it has the opportunity here and now to act in a manner which is consistent with that statement. Either that claim is meant or it is just a kite that has been flown around to attract the attention of people such as the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to gain support and to achieve publicity by saying that something will be done. Here we have the opportunity to act in accordance with that very statement and to follow that philosophy. But what do we find? We find excuses being made for not following it. Senator Alston has said that it is an attempt to dismantle the whole concept. I do not think it is, but I do think that the whole concept at the moment is not working too well and it would not be a bad idea to modify it slightly. Yesterday we had Senator O'Chee suggesting that this amendment as worded would not help certain farm families. A little cooperation from the coalition might have helped it come to terms with that and develop an amendment which did not suffer the inadequacies identified by Senator O'Chee, if there are any. I do not believe there are any but, rather than find an excuse not to support it in that way, a little cooperation might have helped the coalition reach the point which was identified by its spokesperson on education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this process we do not see the coalition demonstrating a real concern for rural Australia. What we see is a set of excuses being found for not taking a step which will actually do something and have the most immediate effect for rural Australia. I get a little tired of these excuses being trotted out. When an opportunity is presented, when will the coalition take some action to actually assist people?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I am being asked to respond to that very broad-brush stuff which does not take account of any of the concessions that jointly we have managed to achieve in relation to hardship. Dr Kemp was saying that there are circumstances of hardship that ought to be recognised, particularly in rural areas. They will continue to recur&mdash;that is why we have taken out the two-year provision&mdash;and we will be looking to ensure that the hardship provisions remain permanently available across the field. That will be our position in due course and the Australian Democrats can wait until they see the detail of that. But what they are doing here has nothing to do with hardship; this is all about trying to retain some shell of an assets test, which will then involve a whole series of assessments as to what should or should not constitute an asset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one then takes out the family farm, the land, the value of the business and all these other bits and pieces, I am not really sure what one is left with, apart from the ski lodge and the second boat. As far as we are concerned, the approach that ought to be taken is the hardship track and not the successive emasculation of assets test provisions, and I am sure the Democrats will understand that if they apply their minds to it; they are quite different concepts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to direct a few remarks to the question of industrial relations in this country, concentrating particularly on the housing industry, and to link in what is happening with the overall thrust by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, to impose upon the industrial relations system a higher and more entrenched position of power for the trade union movement, as against the way in which the ethos is moving in all industries to see a lessening of trade union power and an empowerment of individuals&mdash;which is, of course, in line with the Opposition's policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much speculation on what might be contained in the statement that we shall hear today concerning employment. Indeed, perhaps there will be some statement relating to the better cities program and just what that is meant to be. But it is important to put on the record some of the things that that better cities program may, in fact, be really about. In other words, is there a second agenda, and, if so, what is it?  It is important to look at what might be the second agenda in light of the sorts of statements that we have had from Senator Cook over the period that he has had responsibility for industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I begin by referring to a statement that he made on 19 December entitled `A Presentation of a National Reform Strategy for the Building Industry', a reform that was initially developed to affect the non-residential building industry. However, it is important to put on the record what Senator Cook said were the most important principles or elements that would be involved in the strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that there were seven principles that were important in the building industry, and that those seven principles were:</PARA>
<PARA>One:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">adherence to awards and formal industrial agreements;</PARA>
<PARA>Two:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">adherence to National Wage Case principles;</PARA>
<PARA>Three:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">implementation of award restructuring, in practice on site;</PARA>
<PARA>Four:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">adherence to contracts that conform to a national standard which excludes provision for increases other than those permitted on a strict rise and fall basis or fixed price;</PARA>
<PARA>Five:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">compliance with established national standards for occupational health and safety;</PARA>
<PARA>Six:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">prohibition of "all-in" or "cash-in-hand" payments;</PARA>
<PARA>Seven:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">continuity of employment practices.</PARA>
<PARA>This last principle means that through effective superannuation, severance and redundancy schemes, building workers will be given the option of establishing long term career paths in the industry rather than having to wander from job to job chasing work. Of course, that seventh principle must be seen in light of the Government's and the ACTU's&mdash;and bear in mind that in one sense they are really one and the same, in that the Labor Party is the political wing of the trade union movement&mdash;long and committed fight against the right of subcontractors to remain subcontractors, to remain outside the unionised work force, and to be able to conduct business in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at just what the better cities program may entail, it is most important that we understand that the ACTU and the Government are opposed to the rights of subcontractors. In particular, they are opposed to the success that the Melbourne firm Trouble Shooters had in opposing the trade union movement and the now acknowledged right of people to act as subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at how this national reform strategy has changed from its initial perceived task&mdash;and that was to look at the non-residential building industry&mdash;it is interesting to see that it is now being administered in conjunction with Mr Howe, and that somehow the residential building industry, which has up to now been pretty successful in keeping the trade union organisers at bay, could be an avenue by which the Building Workers Industrial Union in particular might be able to extend its power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there was a nice little meeting held at the beginning of October which involved none other than Mr Sharkey, and involved the Minister, Mr Howe. I understand that the meeting also involved Senator Cook. As a result of that meeting the BWIU sent an invitation to people in the industry to come and talk about how they may all be acting together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the better cities program to look at the way in which the Government may use that program to try to extend union power. Let us suppose we take one of the designated sites which is to have mixed development&mdash;both commercial and residential. Let us suppose there is an over-arching agreement reached between the ACTU and a major contractor or a prime contractor or, indeed, an industry organisation. Let us suppose that home builders&mdash;people who are normally involved with building residential buildings&mdash;were allowed to tender but were allowed to take part in one of these developments only if they adhered to and conformed with the over-arching agreement that had been reached between the trade unions and another party. This would give the unions the ability to be involved in the residential building industry, which, as I said, they have been kept out of until now. Quite clearly, it was the intention of those people who are engaged in that industry to work as they do with subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is itself quite determined and quite clear on what it believes it is entitled to do. The industry regards as inviolate the rights of the self-employed contractor and his right to employ and work alongside award employees. The industry believes that the recruitment by unions and employer groups of on-site workers should be voluntary. There is a feeling, as I said, that the better cities program might be seen by the building unions as allowing them an opportunity to impose working conditions on housing sites which previously have applied only to the commercial and industrial sector. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strong feeling that to change the way in which that part of the industry works at the moment and to be subject to the sorts of work practices and conditions as have been in existence in the industrial and the commercial sector, and thus change the working relationship that exists in the housing sector by somehow using a contrived definition of housing, would certainly be an unwarranted interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the two matters that I have raised, there is a third ingredient. I understand that there is to be a building construction industry council. That council is to have attached to it a reform agency which, it would seem, is to be charged with the responsibility of allowing the trade union movement to move its power into the housing sector&mdash;from which, as I said, it is at the moment excluded. People are happy with the way that they work and they do not want that involvement of unionised power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that is quite worrying about this council is that the rumour mill has it that the chief executive of this so-called reform agency is to be paid, or receive a package of, something in the vicinity of half a million dollars. That is a pretty attractive sort of payment. Maybe it will go to what we might call one of the favoured sons of the trade union movement, who will be given plenty of leeway to be able to extend union power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already have the situation where Minister Cook made it quite clear in the last industry statement that he brought down that it is his aim to do away with common law rights, that he wants to get rid of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act and that he wants to see a labour court administering a labour law which would meet the trade union definition of a suitable industrial framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, that is quite at odds with and quite distinct from the Opposition policy which, as I said before, is to give rights and empowerment to individuals and allow the quite radical thought that employees and employers ought to be able to have discussion together without the intervention of a trade union. That would allow a freeing-up of the workplace, which would enhance productivity and perhaps let us finally begin to make repayments of our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of what I have had to say today relates to the housing industry. People who are engaged in the building of residential dwellings have fiercely fought for their right to be independent of the very strict and damaging unionised movement; they cherish and, indeed, adhere to the principle of the right to have subcontractors; and they believe that individuals have the right to employ themselves and to work alongside people who are employees, and be distinct from them. The Opposition certainly admires the way in which they have conducted themselves. We must put people on alert that the better cities program is not to be used as a Trojan Horse for the trade union movement to extend its power. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a copy of the agreement. The following words at the bottom of that agreement, signed by Ian Taylor, are worth reading:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I confirm that the above correctly reflects the understanding reached between WMC and the AWU at the meetings which I chaired in respect of future underground work practices at Kambalda Nickel Operation.</PARA>
<PARA>If we look at the impact of what has happened, we find that an additional $103m-odd will not now be spent at Kambalda to expand that operation and create some jobs, and that some 150 jobs will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing this agreement, it is worth noting what has happened there. Some months ago Western Mining Corporation gave notice that it was going to expand the operation at Kambalda. In order to do this and extract the easy-to-get-at ore and the higher grade ore, it is necessary for the company to go to full rostering, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. That practice operates in all States of Australia except Western Australia, my home State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth mentioning a number of aspects of the agreement that was put together. A fundamentally contractual arrangement has operated at the mine. The average take-home pay of the people who are involved is $63,000 a year, so one can hardly suggest that they are not reasonably well paid. If this agreement, which was signed by the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, had gone ahead, the average take-home pay would have gone up by about $7,000. On top of that, in accordance with the negotiated agreement, the contract bonus would have gone from 5 per cent to 7 per cent of the profit and an additional one week's holiday per year would have been provided, plus five days additional roster time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one analyses the changes one finds that, in return for working seven days a week on three eight-hour shifts, additional holidays and additional leisure time off, each individual involved would contribute one half-hour per week. That is not a lot when one considers the advantages of keeping the mine operating with the modern machinery in which the company has invested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of points. First of all, after having agreed with Western Mining Corporation on behalf of the AWU, Mr Wilson, who represented the AWU at the discussions which were chaired by the Deputy Premier, put the proposal to the people it affected and added another clause. The proposition he put to them was that, on top of what was already agreed to, they pursue further industrial action to try to get more benefits. In my view, this is absolutely outrageous and unforgivable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Industrial Relations Commission made a decision about agreements. It is absolutely essential that, when an agreement has been made, it stays put and is not replaced by something else. It is also quite ridiculous and unacceptable that, an agreement having been made, further industrial action is pursued. Today and yesterday headlines such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>`Mining Stops. Rosters key to profit from Western Mining Corporation' have appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>it is a lot deeper than that. It is the key to whether Kambalda, a very successful nickel mining town in Western Australia, will exist any longer. Through the breaching of this agreement, which was put together last week, Kambalda's future is now very limited. The whole town&mdash;the people who work there, their families, the schools, et cetera&mdash;will close down prematurely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the hierarchy within the AWU in Western Australia that is responsible, not the work force. The workers there have made it clear that if the coalition's industrial relations policy were in place in this country at present, they would be prepared to sign an agreement with management to keep the mine operating. They recognise that they are well rewarded for what they put into the operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workers also recognise that it is essential that if a company such as Western Mining Corporation is to keep operating, at the end of the day it must utilise its capital investment in the mine. It must have a profit if it is to continue to expand and to move into some of the other nickel operations, its main strength, its forte, in terms of mining in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that it was a significant number of months beforehand when Western Mining had to make its decision about whether to expand its operations and change its work practices to make it possible to expand. All the people involved in the mining operation were notified, as were the people in Kambalda. This was done by direct letters and also by advertisements in the paper, so there was no secret about what was going on. It was a clear-cut case of economics involving the livelihoods of the people working there, their families and the infrastructure of the operation of Western Mining Corporation in Kambalda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute tragedy and a disgrace that we see an operation that has been so successful and has done so much for the State of Western Australia being prematurely wound down through sheer stupidity. I would like to know from the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook&mdash;and I  emphasise now that I informed him today that I would be speaking on this matter in the chamber; but maybe Senator Robert Ray can tell us&mdash;what action the Federal Government is taking on its fast-track proposals, which we shall hear a little more about today. What action has the Government taken in terms of making sure that this project does not collapse? It is a fair and valid question. The Government should let  this side of the chamber, and the people of Australia, know what action has been taken to make sure that Kambalda does not collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might also hear today a little about what is happening with Marandoo and Yakabindie, two other possible developments in Western Australia that are being held up by every form of red tape or whatever else one can think of. This is at a time when not only my State of Western Australia, which had the highest level of unemployment in the figures brought down last week, but also the rest of Australia need those jobs. We also need the export income to assist in balancing our current account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wind up my comments by reiterating the stupidity and the tragedy of what has occurred in Western Australia at Kambalda. It is a case of lost opportunity, not only for Western Mining Corporation and Western Australia but also for the people who live in Kambalda, some of whom are second and third generation people in the town. It has all come about because of total inflexibility and the reneging on an agreement by the leadership of the Australian Workers Union in Western Australia. As I said before, I have a copy of it here, signed by the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, the State Labor member for Kalgoorlie, Ian Taylor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about a matter which touches on some of the issues that were raised so well by my colleagues, Senator Bishop and Senator Crane. The particular focus of my remarks relates to the Food Preservers Union of Australia. I have received a letter from Mr Tom Ryan, the General Secretary of the Food Preservers Union&mdash;I am pleased to say that it was not an impolite letter&mdash;in which he put to me a firm view and sought from me comments and evidence to sustain the remarks which I made some weeks ago in this Parliament about the effect that actions of the Food Preservers Union were having on investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his letter, Tom Ryan referred to a speech which I made on 17 October. I will quote from that speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second example is the bans and other tactics by the Victorian Food Preservers Union which have led to a decline in investment in Victoria in this important industry, as Senator Button will know from his constituents.</PARA>
<PARA>Tom Ryan went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While a lot of people may dismiss such allegations as not important, I find such unsubstantiated allegations a serious attack on the membership of this union.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, he made some firm comments to me. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not been told by any company that this union is the cause of any decline in investment in Victoria. If you have any information I should be aware of, I would be pleased if you would share that information with this union so that we can include that knowledge in our considerations during our decision making procedures within the union.</PARA>
<PARA>So I am very pleased, as I said, to respond to the request by Tom Ryan. I do not know Tom Ryan well. I suspect the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), who is at the table, may know him well. For all I know, he may well be a close friend of Tom Ryan. I have noted that some people have referred to Tom Ryan as being a member of the tomato Left. Is that the case, Minister?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, it was a serious letter and I plan to respond in a serious manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence which I use to sustain the remarks that I made in an earlier speech came from a fairly substantial document&mdash;and I have to say I am rather surprised that Tom Ryan was not apparently aware of it&mdash;put out by the Committee of Melbourne and entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impediments to Cost Competitiveness in Victorian Food Processing</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report highlighted the fact that the food processing industry in Victoria has great potential as a value added industry which could be, and indeed should be, making an important contribution to Australia's balance of trade position.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is clear when one reads the report that these opportunities are not being taken advantage of. In fact, the report indicated that the industry was in serious decline because of a number of factors&mdash;they are effectively identified&mdash;which combine to make Victoria a high risk investment for this type of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important factor which was identified by the study was what it termed `the need for improvement in industrial relations in Victoria'. From time to time, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has something to say on this subject. We had a debate recently on the effectiveness of the policies of this Government and the Kirner Government in improving industrial relations in Victoria. Those of us, like Senator Ray, who are Victorians know names such as Wally Curran and others that make it fairly hard to sustain that sort of position. I suspect, having gone through extensive press cuttings on the Food Preservers Union, that Tom Ryan's history has not been altogether constructive in ensuring harmonious industrial relations between management and workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as I said, the report put out by the Committee of Melbourne said that for many products in the food processing industry, improvements on these industrial dimensions would have a greater impact on the value of an investment than the removal of all other impediments combined. Tom Ryan does not seem to appreciate that interviews conducted in the course of this study identified over $160m-worth of investment which could go ahead if changes were made to labour relations in Victoria in the food processing industry. The report indicates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current industrial relations are a significant contributor to the perception that Victoria is high risk. . .</PARA>
<PARA>and it notes that this is especially important in the high value-added product areas such as vegetables and baked goods. As I said, Tom Ryan does not appear to be aware of this very large, important report which, on checking through the media of the time, I found had received fairly extensive press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study points out that it is not only a question of wage rates, which are competitive with other developed countries; it is one of labour productivity. Labour productivity is severely hampered by high penalty rates, inefficient work practices, a lack of union discipline and a high level of industrial disputes. This is the State that Senator Cook has drawn our attention to on a number of occasions as being something of a model in the area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from the study again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three main areas of concern were highlighted: penalty rates, which discourage asset utilisation on more than a one-shift basis, work practices, which are estimated to increase labour costs by around 10%, and unpredictable, `irrational' work stoppages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study gives the highest priority among its recommendations to measures designed to address these problems, including negotiated workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One company executive is quoted in the report as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think anything meaningful will happen until we get site agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the onus is very much on the relevant trade unions to achieve the conditions for growth in investment. As the report says, what is needed is a commitment by the unions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to create [an] industrial relations environment conducive to investment in [the] processed food industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does give some mention to the Food Preservers Union, Tom Ryan's union, in the industry. As Senator Ray could probably confirm, it has a reputation as a hard Left union. Perhaps those of us who are somewhat older in this chamber will recall that a former secretary of that union was Baghdad Bill Hartley. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 17 February 1991 said, `Hartley, unions to visit Baghdad'. One of the reports said:</PARA>

<PARA>I do not think he did go to Baghdad so I do not want to go on record as implying he did, but what I suggest is that the affection that certain leaders in that union have had for Baghdad seems to have been continued at least to a certain extent by Tom Ryan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to read, at the end of Mr Ryan's letter to me, that this union accepts that it has a responsible role to play in the future of the food processing industry in Australia.

If Mr Tom Ryan has not got a copy of this report, I would be very pleased to see whether I could obtain a full copy of the report for him. I will also be able to draw to his attention some other press cuttings which he apparently was not aware of. Senators in the chamber may be aware of the notorious Heinz dispute which occurred earlier this year in which the Heinz factory in Victoria effectively had to close down, causing enormous losses to tomato growers. Of course, one of the unions involved in that particular dispute was the Food Preservers Union. I shall be very happy to respond to the letter of Mr Tom Ryan. As I said, it was not a threatening letter by any means; it was a letter seeking the evidence on which I had based my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have done today is to stand up in this chamber and provide the evidence that the Food Preservers Union in the past has not altogether played a very constructive role in the industry and that investment in the industry has been affected by its particular activities. I hope that what Mr Tom Ryan says in his letter, that he believes the union should play a responsible role, indicates that we are seeing the Food Preservers Union and its leadership turning over a new leaf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment is that he felt that my letter was a reflection on the workers in the Food Preservers Union. I have always been fairly careful in this Parliament, as indeed many of my colleagues have, in that we often have to draw, and very appropriately, a distinction between the union leadership and the union workers. Never has the distinction been sharper, I think, than under this Government in recent years where union leadership has been able to increase its powers and privilege, but the living standards and the jobs of ordinary workers have been greatly diminished. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This relates, Senator Robert Ray might be interested to hear, to Senator Collins's north Queensland office, which is based in Townsville. That office, which is set up by the Minister in Townsville for his use, was used by him in the year 1 July 1990 to 31 July 1991 on one occasion. On only one occasion was that office used. The Minister was there on that one occasion for three whole days. Having an office in that town for a whole year, the Minister used it for three days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, for some information about the cost of this office. I was told that the cost of the office in one year was $154,000-odd, which included one permanent ministerial adviser on the payroll at $46,000, rent of about $20,000, and cleaning and electricity, fit-out fees, furniture, transportation of furniture, telephones and installation, and office equipment, to a total of $154,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus did not tell me about the cost of the additional staff member there who gets a salary of about $37,000; he did not tell me about the Comcar bills and the plane travel for the staff; and he did not tell me about the overtime. I would estimate those at $10,000. So, if we add those costs to the $154,000, we get to about $200,000 in one year for running that office in Townsville. This is all for an office that the Minister uses on one occasion for three days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the Minister have the office in Townsville? Could it possibly be argued that the Government needs a liaison office in the Townsville area to keep the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australian abreast of what is happening in that particular part of the world? One wonders what all the other Federal government departments are doing there. Townsville is served by offices of DAS, Australian Construction Services, Attorney-General, Australian Customs Service, ATSIC, Australia Post, Austrade, Australian Electoral Commission, Australian Federal Police, the Australian Government Solicitor, AIMS, ASC, the Office of War Graves, bankruptcy administration, Bureau of Meteorology, CAA, CES, the Director of Public Prosecutions, DSS, health, CSIRO, Defence, DEET, FAC, the Family Court of Australia, GBRMPA, Industrial Relations, Immigration, Primary Industries and Energy, Tax, Telecom, Trade Practices Commission, Transport and Communications&mdash;of which the Minister's portfolio is a part&mdash;and Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although all of these offices are in Townsville, apparently it was necessary to spend another $200,000 to give the Minister the luxury of having an office there that he uses three days a year. Surely those other government departments in Townsville could keep</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia abreast of what was happening in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, one might also ask: if he wants some political on-the-ground information, what is wrong with the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is also based in Townsville? Mr Lindsay has an office with three or four staff. Why could he not tell Senator Collins what is going on? In addition to that, Senator Reynolds, a Labor Party senator for Queensland, also has an office in that same town. And not far away is Mr Gayler with four staff and two officers, and Mr Hulls with four staff and two officers. If they cannot tell the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support what is happening, I do not know who can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that if he needs a bit of extra political clout, there are three State Labor members in Townsville, all with staff and lurks and perks. A couple of them are Ministers. There is also a Labor controlled city council with all of its staff and resources available. So what is that all about? Why was the $200,000 spent on that? What is so wrong with Senator Collins's staff in Townsville that he needs, in addition to them, an office of the aNiMaLS&mdash;the National Media Liaison Service&mdash;in Townsville? The Service does not have many offices outside capital cities but there is one in Townsville. Senator Collins's ministerial staff in Townsville obviously cannot do the job, so the Government has to throw in an aNiMaLS staff as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the aNiMaLS in Townsville has been estimated&mdash;I have the figures here but I will not go through them&mdash;at about $100,000. This figure excludes the cost of furnishings and office equipment which, based on the figures I have for Senator Collins's office, would be quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the aNiMaLS office in Townsville, according to Senator Richardson in answer to a question, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide and co-ordinate the provision of accurate and timely information on Government policies and programs throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned to Senator Richardson at the time he gave that answer, I have a junior staffer who does exactly that.

My junior staffer, in the first couple of hours of a working day, has the responsibility of supplying 32 shadow Ministers with anything in the local papers or on the local radio and television that is related to their work. Yet, it takes two officers and four highly paid staff to do the same thing for the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does it take them so long? If one were cynical, one might say that maybe the aNiMaLS are there to provide Mr Lindsay, Senator Reynolds and other ALP politicians&mdash;and maybe the Mayor and the State members, for all we know&mdash;with political information on a daily basis that they need to try to keep themselves in government. It will not work. Maybe that is what it is all about. Maybe it is for pure political purposes. It would be disgraceful if that was so. But there seems to be no other justification for that sort of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we add up the cost of Senator Collins's office and the aNiMaLS office in Townsville, the amount is over $300,000. This is the cost of sustaining a fully staffed office designed to cater for eight people&mdash;not just the two that are there now; and who knows what we are going to get in the future&mdash;which the Minister admits he uses once in 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, there is the fully staffed office of the aNiMaLS&mdash;the National Media Liaison Service&mdash;which performs the function that my junior staffer does in a couple of hours each morning. All of these functions could be performed by the local ALP politicians and the local Commonwealth Government staff in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government has $300,000 to throw around and waste in that sort of way in the Townsville region, I suggest that the people of Australia may well be much better served if that $300,000 was spent on fixing the absolutely atrocious state of the Bruce Highway up that way. People cannot drive anywhere on that highway without breaking windscreens or springs. Regrettably, there are far too many fatalities in that area because of the shocking state of the roads on which the Government has no money to spend. But the Government has $300,000 to spend on a couple of offices to serve the political purposes of this ALP Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why cannot the Government use that $300,000 to keep the animal production unit at the CSIRO Davies Laboratory at Townsville? That unit has to be moved because there is no money to keep it there. But we have $300,000 to be used for the Minister's political purposes. If the Government wanted to spend $300,000 in the Townsville area, why not move the School of Artillery up there? That might interest Senator Ray. That money could be used to help move the School of Artillery to that area, as his predecessor promised a couple of weeks before the last Federal election would happen. That was obviously said in an attempt&mdash;successful as it was&mdash;to keep the ALP member, Mr Lindsay, in a seat which contains the Lavarack Barracks. The Minister's predecessor promised to move the School of Artillery there two years ago. Since then we have heard not one peep about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Minister was not even aware that that arrangement had been made. I understand from both the Minister's office and Mr Lindsay's office that maybe it is not now going to happen. As I said, just a couple of weeks before the last Federal election people were told, obviously with the Army vote in mind, that the School of Artillery was going there. If the Government has $300,000 to spare, why does not the Minister use it there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government has $300,000 to spend in the Townsville area, maybe the Minister could use it to assist Senator Richardson's much publicised push in Townsville to help fund the dredging of the port which is needed to keep the Booloo nickel factory going and save a thousand jobs in the Townsville area. But that is not going ahead. There is an awful lot of uncertainty about that although another thousand of our fellow Australians could well be thrown out of work because no-one wants to pay for the dredging of the port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government has a spare $300,000 to throw around for political services maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;that money might be able to be used for dredging the port which would help save a thousand jobs in the Townsville region. Finally, if the Government has $300,000 to spare, maybe it could throw a bit of it to the Ravenshoe creditors, people who lent money to the Ravenshoe Mill because they thought the Government was looking after the $7m of taxpayers' money it pumped into that mill. Because the creditors thought the Government was looking after $7m of the money of the people of Australia&mdash;it was not&mdash;they gave that credit and then found that someone had whisked away the money. In many instances, people lost their businesses and, in some cases, their homes as well. That measly sum of $300,000 could be used far better in compensating most of those people than in spending it on a couple of political offices for the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wanted to draw to the attention of the Senate the blatant waste of that money on those offices in the Townsville region. It is a completely unwarranted lavishness with taxpayers' money that cannot under any circumstances, particularly the circumstances I have outlined, be justified in this day and age. It shows a complete underutilisation of the Public Service there and is an unethical provision of staff services to assist in political matters. I hope that Senator Collins will do the right thing in relation to those offices. He should shut down both offices and use the $300,000 and more spent on those services each year on other services in the Townsville region which would really help the people of that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday, I, with a number of colleagues, had the opportunity to travel to the University of New England at Armidale. There is a proposal to establish at Armidale a cooperative research centre for the Australian beef industry. Honourable senators would be aware that the Federal Government initiated a series of cooperative research centres in an effort to better address the costs of research and the needs of industry. The first round of 15 cooperative research centre proposals was completed last year. We are now in the second round of approvals. It is an indictment of the priorities of this anti-rural Federal Labor Government that no rural research centres were established in the first round of 15 new centres. In fact, this centre at Armidale is the first rural centre to be contemplated under the new arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal seeks a minimum of $2m of Commonwealth funds a year for five years for the cattle and beef industry, which is the fastest-growing rural export industry in this country. The beef industry in Australia is dynamic. I have told the Senate many times about the tremendous expansion that has occurred in this industry in a relatively short time. We have seen an explosion in the number of new beef breeds available in Australia. There has been exciting research into nutrition, genetic selection and manipulation, housing, transport, husbandry, economics, and management. In fact, at the moment, researchers are even at the stage of getting very close to being able to sex semen. They will be able to identify semen that will produce bull calves and semen that will produce heifer calves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new proposal for the CRC will bring together the best of all that research. As the promotional brochure suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CRC involves diverse interest groups pulling together to secure value added rewards for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>The research will be done by world-class scientists from the University of New England, CSIRO and the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and will put Australia in the lead in understanding how to produce export beef to specification. No longer will scientists, beef producers, consumers or end use customers all be working in different directions. Scientists will know what the end user wants and develop ways and means that allow the beef producer to produce an animal for that market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not forget that Australia's future lies in South East Asia. It is an enormous and expanding export market for Australia. We have to learn what that market wants and produce it. I believe we can do that. Whether our customers want young beef or old, with one millimetre of fat or heavily marbled, Australia has the capacity to produce just that meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our biggest problems at the moment are, first, that we do not know what our markets want, and secondly, that we have great beef producers but few who know how to condition their cattle to suit that specified market. Traditionally, in Australia farmers bred cattle, fattened them to a certain age&mdash;as long as it rained, of course&mdash;depending largely on breed and availability of pasture to fatten them, and then sold them on the local market. The advent of feedlots changed that and it will continue to expand its increasing influence on the Australian beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous amount of capital tied up in our feedlots. Many are overseas owned and are producing for specific markets such as those in Japan and in Korea as well. Yet even the people running those specialised feedlots would like more knowledge on the best breeds to use, the best ages, and the best feed rations to maximise profit. The CRC will be able to deliver that sort of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the publications that it has put out is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning Market Share. . . through positioning Australia's beef industry towards 2000 and beyond</EMPHASIS>. One of the areas that is mentioned is animal health and welfare, and it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many areas of animal health and welfare, peculiar to the feedlot industry, need urgent investigation if the industry is to mature and prosper in a community which is becoming increasingly aware of and concerned for these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the newly formed Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs will be examining in the next year or so, as well, to help centres such as the CRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The publication also says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feedlot industry is becoming a major contributor to winning market share for Australian high quality beef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To correctly position the feedlot industry for the future, an integrated research and development programme incorporating an education and training function needs to be established in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I say `Hear, hear!' I entirely agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will not only target feedlot users, but it will also benefit people in the pasture fed industries. The Australian beef industry is presently worth some $3.5 billion annually, with exports of some $2.3 billion each year. We could be producing $2 billion worth of quality beef with an expansion of some 6,000 new jobs, and at least 30,000 part time jobs in associated service industries if we continue to expand the feedlot industry and produce better beef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This cooperative research centre will enhance our international competitiveness, expand that export income and establish a firm base from which Australia can grow and develop a reputation as a producer of world class beef, just as we have developed a reputation as the world's premier wool producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is holding us back is lack of commitment to that ideal and a lack of financial backing for our research institutions. Additionally, what it will also develop is an excellence in rural education in the form of a school of meat science. From that learning will come our future research scientists, feedlot managers, and agricultural economists with particular expertise in the meat industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal already has the support of the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Lot Feeders Association, CSIRO and the University of New England. But what it needs is support from other industries such as beef societies, beef producers and those with an interest in investment in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next round of interviews for this project will be held on 20 November. I cannot contemplate such a vital project as this not having the support it requires from the Federal Government. I am asking the Federal Government sincerely to put in its bit to make sure this proceeds. Here is an opportunity for the Government to do something positive for Australia and for Australian agriculture. The principles involved in the proposal thus far have demonstrated very clearly the need for such a project. They have demonstrated very adequately their ability actually to deliver what they suggest should happen. I wish the project well for the future and I have every confidence that we will see this project come to fruition in a very short time, as long as it has the stimulus of government backing and also the backing of the people in the industry itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the same subject as my colleague Senator Crane spoke on&mdash;the very sad situation in Kambalda this week. We have heard the term `fast tracking' a lot in recent weeks in the desperate bid by governments and trade unions to find a solution to the appalling unemployment crisis that Australia faces. The situation in Kambalda is indeed an example of a government backtracking as opposed to fast tracking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Crane has already said, Western Mining Corporation was given an undertaking, in informal as well as formal circumstances, that amendments would be passed to the draconian industrial laws in Western Australia to allow a constant roster and a constant mining of the ore body at Kambalda, which is, as most of us would know, an enormous operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in the issue arose when some six months ago  I attended a wine-tasting function at Coolgardie with a number of the people from Kambalda. I was taken aside by a number of the miners from Kambalda and these workers alerted me to the fact that Western Mining Corporation was going to implement the new continuous roster. They had some very genuine concerns about the effect that that continuous mining roster would have on the community in Kambalda. Of course, if workers at Kambalda have a five-day roster and are not working on Saturdays or Sundays, they can enjoy a fairly normal lifestyle. They can play football on Saturday afternoons and pursue other normal recreational pursuits and the community life will be quite similar to that in a metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people at the function were very concerned. Indeed, they asked me to make representations to the Government and to Western Mining Corporation saying that they were bitterly opposed to the proposal and that if it went ahead there would be industrial action, the place would shut down and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has happened since then is that Western Mining Corporation and those workers, without much help from the AWU, went into a consultation process. Many of those workers&mdash;a majority of them, I believe&mdash;now favour the proposal, which Senator Crane very aptly described, for a continuous roster, an increase in take-home pay of about $7,000 a year, and extra holiday entitlements. The community as a whole has accepted the fact that if Kambalda is to survive, if the nickel operation is to survive, we need that continuous roster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, as Senator Crane also said, it is a situation that occurs around the rest of Australia and one that our competitors in the nickel mining industry have internationally, and that Western Australia is the odd man out. What is so sad about this is that Western Mining Corporation was given an undertaking by the Premier of Western Australia, and the Deputy Premier, who is the local member for Kalgoorlie, that that would be done. Yesterday, the Deputy Premier, Ian Taylor MLA, backtracked on that proposal. He said that he was not going to do it now because the negotiations with the AWU had broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important thing about this&mdash;there are a number of important things&mdash;is that Western Mining Corporation has been negotiating its way through a whole series of hurdles leading to being able to expand the nickel operation at Kambalda, to invest another $105m to create more jobs directly at the mine, and, I presume, to create more jobs in the support industries in the town of Kambalda and in the goldfields generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have had to overcome disadvantages in the cost of transport and the ludicrously high cost of electricity in Western Australia, all sorts of other government regulations and all of the normal problems that anyone seeking to exploit a mineral resource in Australia is faced with. They had this last hurdle to overcome in relation to work practices and the implementation of this continuous roster and they thought they had it beaten. They had agreement from the Government, they had almost unanimous agreement from the local community and the workers. That one last hurdle they were hoping to  overcome by an amendment going through the Parliament of Western Australia in the last few days of this year; but the hurdle was raised at the last minute. Any hurdler will tell you that it is pretty hard to win a race if the last hurdle is pushed up just before you get to the finish line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what has happened, and the cost of it directly has been 150 jobs; people are already receiving, either today or tomorrow, their retrenchment notices. It will, of course, create more unemployment in Kambalda and the goldfields in the service industries, in the delicatessens, the bakers, the butchers and the candlestick makers, who will lose trade and go out of business. The effect on the local community will be severe. Unemployment in the regional areas of Western Australia is the highest anywhere in Australia. There are hundreds of thousands of young people out of work in regional Australia, and the goldfields, a major regional centre, will again have a setback. These are the sorts of setbacks that lead to the formation of ghost towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important issue, apart from the human impact, is the international competitive situation. Senator Kemp talked about a report on impediments to cost competitiveness in the food processing industry and said that the resolution of labour relations issues in itself could see $160m being invested in that industry. Again, it is labour relations in Western Australia which will see $105m of investment go out the window. The worst thing about that is that the price of nickel is set on a world market which we have no control over. We can control all of those things within Australia, but, if we are not internationally competitive, we will not mine our nickel and we will not be able to sell it because it will not be profitable. One of the problems with that is that future investment will be affected. If Western Mining Corporation, which has already got a hole in the ground and has already been mining nickel there for decades, cannot expand its current operations, why would someone else even bother going to explore for nickel or any other ore? Why would they bear all the costs of exploration and try to jump all the hurdles that are put up by the greens and the environmental protection authorities and every other hurdle that is put in the way of development: the Aboriginal heritage issues which we have already heard about at Yakabindie and other government red tape? Why would they even bother when a company that is already established in Kambalda, mining nickel&mdash;</PARA>

I make a plea to the Premier and to the Deputy Premier of Western Australia to reconsider their decision. I make a further plea to them to implement the changes that are required. I also make a plea to the union movement. Only 10 or 15 days ago, Martin Ferguson made a plea for resource development and getting these impediments out of the way of resource developments. Those words came from the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson. I make a plea to his AWU brothers in Western Australia to heed the words of Martin Ferguson, to forget their class war or their class struggle or whatever else they are struggling for over there, and to get on with getting this expansion of the Kambalda nickel mine achieved.

I further note media reports in which the Minister's office said that the export in question&mdash;200 kilograms of strontium oxalate&mdash;was not for military purposes and did not violate the arms embargo. I ask the Minister:  Does he agree that the bill of entry I have supplied to him today clearly shows that the shipment of strontium oxalate went to Swartklip Products Pty Ltd on behalf of Armscor, the Armaments Corporation of South Africa Ltd?  Secondly, can the Minister explain why Defence Science officials quoted in last Friday's denials were unaware that strontium oxalate is used in the manufacture of tracer bullets for the targeting of automatic weapons, even though this use is listed in the publicly available <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encyclopaedia of Chemical Technology</EMPHASIS>?  Thirdly, does the Minister agree that, contrary to statements made by his office, this export is a clear violation of United Nations security resolutions 182 and 418, which impose the arms embargo on South Africa?  Finally, will the Government launch an immediate investigation into why this export was not prevented by its much vaunted military export controls, and what other military exports have occurred in violation of the guidelines?</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Evans made the point very strongly that, at the very least, what was needed was a full and credible inquiry into the incident; that the result of the inquiry should be very much in the public domain; and that in the event that this inquiry showed that there had been significant overreaction or human rights abuses, then appropriate action would have to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Alatas made it clear that he very much shares our concerns about the incident.  He acknowledged the need for an inquiry, and one which would be credible so far as the international community was concerned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our embassy official arrived in Dili on the afternoon of 13 November.  He plans to stay in Dili for several days so as to speak to as many people as he can about the incident.  We are not yet in a position to speak with any certainty about many of the details of the incident.  The Indonesian authorities in Jakarta are themselves continuing with their inquiries and are awaiting the return of a number of key personnel from Dili. General Sutrisno is reported to have told reporters in Jakarta yesterday that, at the most, 50 people died in the incident.  Whatever the final number of casualties, it is obvious that an appalling tragedy has occurred.</PARA>

In a situation as sensitive as East Timor, the need for a measured response by the Indonesian military is particularly important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a convenient prepaid service which does not require any documentation or post office attendance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The express post service is a quite different service from the priority paid service. The priority paid service is not a speed service;  it is a head of queue service which ensures that mail gets sorted as a priority over standard mail.

All honourable senators will recall that when the requirement for the provision of tax file numbers was made all those over 80 years of age were exempted. That certainly remains the policy of the Government. On Melbourne radio today I think a pastor had quite a bit to say about tax file numbers being provided by the elderly. I cannot walk away from the provision of tax file numbers for those who are not 80 years old. Of course, it is possible that in some cases a tax file number could be sought from someone over 80. If it was thought that that person was being incorrectly paid, that certainly might happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a difficulty in sending out letters to age pensioners because, in looking at the requirements for tax file numbers, my Department, naturally enough, must comply with privacy guidelines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand why some pensioners would be disappointed and concerned at receiving letters that suggest that they face consequences if a tax file number is not provided. But those pensioners who are over 80 years of age have, by now, been contacted and told that they do not have to provide a tax file number. Unfortunately, in September some of them received a notice suggesting that they did, and they have received letters of apology. But the great bulk of them have received letters notifying them that they do not have to supply tax file numbers, so that will not be a matter of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think all honourable senators understood, in passing the legislation, that if we were going to make a requirement of someone who was not 80 but was, let us say, 79 years of age to provide a tax file number and if we had to follow privacy guidelines&mdash;again, as everyone in the Senate understood&mdash;then obviously we would have some problems in the wording of letters to those people.</PARA>

We have given people plenty of time and notice&mdash;the first time was actually in May&mdash;of the need to supply them. I do not believe we will find this a great problem in the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that, over the last 18 months or so we have put in place what is essentially a 10-point program to assist Australian industry to get greater access to government purchasing. That, of course, has been based on the principle which has been espoused in the question: that government purchasing can, and does, play an important role in terms of assisting domestic industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first big step in that 10-point program has been to deregulate the purchasing function itself. It has changed from one which was process ridden to one which now relies heavily on the initiative of the purchasing officer. In that process we also changed the consideration by which government purchases have abided. Now the government purchasing officer has been asked to look at value for money as the prime objective. As a consequence, that means there is an advantage to Australian industry, and technical backup and quicker supply are obviously taken into account more than they have been in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, as part of that change there has been an explicit policy of maximising opportunities for Australian and New Zealand industry. The second part of the program has been to establish the Purchase Australian Office. That was established to improve opportunities for local suppliers. It has also assisted in fostering recognition amongst purchasers and suppliers of the role they can play in respect of each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important part of the office has been to investigate complaints of bias in purchasing as against local industry. We have also embarked on a three-point plan of campaign. One of the most important aspects has been to change the culture of purchasing. To do that we have had to change the culture within the public sector to get it to appreciate the benefits of buying domestically. The Offshore, What For? campaign was developed for that purpose. As well as that, together with David Beddall I have been involved in a program of meet-the-buyers exhibitions, basically to establish contact between suppliers and government purchasers in order that they can both understand how each other works and what government needs are in terms of purchasing. The Purchase Australian campaign continues, and next week I will be launching a new phase directed towards suppliers, once again geared to greater information sharing amongst them all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important move was the measure to redress inequity in the system. Government and government suppliers had been exempt from paying import duties, which everyone else was obliged to pay. To send the appropriate signal to buyers and to level the playing field here to assist Australian industry, the duty has now been levied and purchasers are now required to pay equivalent to import duty on the purchases they make from abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specifications have been changed. We recognise that there is inherent bias in the old system of process ridden specifications. We have now moved towards functional ones. In themselves, they lead to less reliance on off-the-shelf overseas products, which also help to disadvantage Australian industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will attempt to keep my answer to about half the length of Senator Boswell's question. The only confusion that exists is with Senator Boswell. He knows full well that no charges have been set. This is a complex area and it has been subjected to a lot of debate; but even those who have been involved only on the periphery know that the entire process is in the hands of the Premiers Conference. Senator Boswell knows that it is not simply a Federal Government responsibility; it is collectively in the hands of the Prime Minister and the Premiers and Chief Ministers. They have determined that no charges have yet been set.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell rightly talks about inferences. A whole range of charges has been recommended and suggested by various bodies. It is true that the committees that have assisted the Premiers Conference and other groups have come up with those sorts of figures. The figures do show that, based on the models used at the time, a 42.5-tonne, six-axle articulated truck may be paying something in the vicinity of $7,000 to $8,000, phased in from 1 January 1993 to 1 July 1995. This would be based on a nominated mass approach for vehicles travelling an average distance for their vehicle class. This is what both I and Mr Brown have been saying. I might add that Senator Boswell omitted to say&mdash;and it should be said for the clarification of everyone&mdash;that Queensland will be nominated as a low cost zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that that initiative&mdash;from which I take some satisfaction&mdash;was brought about as the result of very strenuous representations made by my colleague in the House of Representatives Warren Snowdon; by me as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia; and, I am happy to say, because I helped facilitate the meetings, very effectively made to the Prime Minister personally by representatives from the trucking organisations themselves.

The Medicare fees that will flow from the consultants' report will provide for a reasonable return for each level of practice where the practice operates efficiently and economically. The new fee structure will remove the potential for unnecessary services by reducing fees for plain X-rays&mdash;for example, chest and limbs&mdash;based on the model practice, and increasing fees for the more complex diagnostic radiological services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The model practice produced by the consultant provides for a practice which operates during normal hours. The decision to provide services beyond these hours is a matter for each practice. Medicare fees do not reflect costs associated with after hours services.

I am very surprised that Senator Kemp, who deliberately set out on 15 October to mislead the Senate about a consumption tax, should be the one chosen to ask this question. In a debate on 15 October, Senator Kemp implied on a number of occasions that the Asia-Pacific region countries, most of our major trading partners, had a consumption tax of the kind which the Opposition is proposing to introduce if it were ever elected to government.

I am just making the point that there are a lot of people on the other side of the chamber with pimples on their tongues about the consumption tax. Senator Kemp, who asked this question, has the biggest pimple of all. With regard to Senator Kemp's reasonably lucid reading from the 1985 document, in 1985 there was a widespread debate about a consumption tax and there were views put for and against it. As those opposite know, the Government ultimately made a judgment about it. The Prime Minister was articulating in that statement views put in favour of a consumption tax, and there were views put both ways. We took on that issue in 1985 and debated it. As Mr Downer said this week in the House of Representatives, those opposite never tackled it because they did not have the guts. Now they are here full of guts, but no brains. That is their problem as an opposition. There are no brains at all in these sorts of allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the propitious day of 11 November, Senator Panizza asked me a question concerning the alleged, by him, actions of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union in relation to the proposed Moora Straw Based Pulp and Paper Mill. I have a long answer to that question. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I have now had the opportunity to inquire into this matter and I must say at the outset that I am disappointed that Senator Panizza has chosen to misrepresent the intentions of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, on 11 November, Senator Panizza asserted in his question that this particular union is and I quote `trying to wreck the proposed straw pulp &amp; paper mill at Moora in Western Australia before it gets off the ground'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of Senator Panizza's concerns emanate, in part, from a letter he received from the union which&mdash;rather than wreck the proposal as asserted by Senator Panizza&mdash;is a genuine attempt by the union to clarify the position with respect to the likely effects of the Moora proposal on existing domestic manufacturers and employment in the packaging industry in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the union would, and indeed should, be concerned if jobs were deliberately threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the union's principal concerns are twofold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, whilst supporting the need for economically viable and competitive new investments in Australia, the union questions the economic feasibility of the proposed Moora project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the union is concerned that imported packaging product now imported by a potential partner in the Moora proposal is imported at dumped prices and threatening local industry and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taking these issues seriatim, I am advised that the Australian Wheat Board, a shareholder in the Moora Project, commissioned a consultancy into the economic feasibility of a wheat straw based pulp &amp; paper mill at Moora in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funds used so far, some $1.2 million, are drawn from the Wheat Industry Fund. The Wheat Board administers the fund in accordance with an Annual Business Plan approved by the Grains Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is not involved in approving this Plan, reflecting the grower ownership of this fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's main involvement in the fund is through the provision of a guarantee of fund borrowings up to a limit of $100 million for the first five years of the fund's establishment. This guarantee terminates after 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 sets out the uses of the Wheat Industry Fund and Ministerial approval had previously been given under Section 82(1)(e) of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 for the Wheat Board to invest money in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice to generate income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is under this approval that the Wheat Board has proceeded with its involvement with the Moora Company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Moora Project is a commercial project and in that regard, the Wheat Board has advised that the feasibility study for the Project, which was undertaken by Jaako Poyry, is a confidential document to the shareholders of the project namely the Australian Wheat Board, the Riverhouse Group and the Moora Community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has not seen any such reports by Jaako Poyry and therefore cannot comment on them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having said that, however, I'm aware that there is considerable debate in Western Australia about the Moora Project and its financial viability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that other independent assessments of the financial viability of the Moora Project have been undertaken by reputable consultants, including NLK-Celpap, which have concluded that the project is not financially viable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, in view of the Commonwealth's involvement in guaranteeing the Wheat Board's Wheat Industry Fund, the Government will be taking a keen interest to ensure that should the Moora Project proceed, then it does so on the strength of its commercial viability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moving on Mr President, and in relation to the Union's concern that packaging product, now imported by a shareholder in the Moora Project, is imported at dumped prices, I am unable to take this matter any further as it is not a matter for the Government to initiate anti-dumping actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suffice it to say, however, that the packaging industry in Australia is dominated by two suppliers&mdash;Australian Paper Manufacturers and Visy Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The market in Western Australia consumes about 35,000 tonnes of box packaging per year and Riverhouse Packaging&mdash;a shareholder in the Moora Project&mdash;is importing around 100 tonnes per month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, it is well-known that this Government will not allow unfair competition from dumped imports which damage local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the March Economic Statement, the Government took steps to immediately strengthen anti-dumping procedures as well as initiating a comprehensive review of anti-dumping procedures and the operations of the Anti-Dumping Authority. The review will be finalised by the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review is comparing the anti-dumping practices of other countries and involves a detailed comparison of the requirements of GATT against current Australian legislation and practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, Mr President the behaviour of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union is entirely appropriate and their actions have been directed to clarifying the situation surrounding the Moora Project and not wrecking the project as Senator Panizza would have us believe.</PARA>

This involves recipients completing a form detailing their intentions regarding employment and the steps taken to obtain it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment may be as the Minister for Social Security has characterised it, but it is a fact that within this legislation it can be possible, with imagination, actually to achieve something that helps farmers immediately. When we look at some of the other arrangements that are made, their complexity is such that in effect it is difficult to see an immediate result for farmers. For example, if we take the rural assistance scheme, part C,  by the time the farmer has made the decision that he should apply for, be eligible for and actually receive assistance under such a scheme, the decision has to be made to leave the farm. That is not a decision that can be made overnight. Yet immediately that decision is made, the family&mdash;three or four generations of which may have earned their income from that farm&mdash;is faced with an entirely different lifestyle arrangement and future from that which they have been used to for some generations.</PARA></TALK.START>

As a matter of fact, there are very few who are able to fit that category. The suggestions Senator Lees has been making in the amendments have been to bring immediate relief. I remind the Minister that this latest amendment would not mean that every farmer would immediately become eligible for social security payments, because the income test would still remain. There is no suggestion that that is the purpose behind Senator Lees's amendment. The purpose is to bring immediate financial relief to those families suffering hardship at the moment. If a slight change to a few words would bring about that relief, surely we ought to be looking at that instead of finding excuses why it cannot be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia today is at a point of historic convergence:  the hurt of the recession is at its point of maximum impact; yet, simultaneously, and by no means coincidentally, the gains and rewards of the long hard process of restructuring are within our grasp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate focus of this statement is on the problem of unemployment. But through that prism, we want today to look ahead&mdash;to the prospects and promise for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this statement today we bring to the people of Australia a message of fundamental confidence. It is a message grounded firmly on the facts, not only the factual evidence of recovery, but upon the most important fact of all&mdash;that the work of this Government over the years, and the response of the Australian people, have brought us together to the threshold of a new era of achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the specific context of unemployment, we begin with this unqualified assertion:  this Labor Government has an unalterable commitment to preventing the present levels of unemployment from becoming a permanent feature of the Australian economy and the Australian society. I say to this House what the Prime Minister has said repeatedly outside: he has not spent the whole of his 33 years in public life in the Labor movement of Australia to acquiesce in allowing the present high levels of unemployment to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some weeks ago, the Prime Minister initiated an examination of what action the Government could take to respond to the current severe unemployment situation. In the same period, the Parliamentary Labor Party's working group on unemployment under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Page, Mr Harry Woods, has worked with great diligence to produce a constructive report. Further, in accordance with undertakings the Prime Minister gave in his address to the ACTU Congress in September, he met with representatives of the ACTU on 29 October to consider their proposals to alleviate unemployment. The Prime Minister has also had the benefit of consultation within the Economic Planning Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an outcome of these analyses and these consultations, we shall be detailing, later in this statement, measures related to the unemployment problem. These measures build on the strategy for reducing unemployment already put in place by the Budget. The measures include:</PARA>
<PARA>-initiatives in the post&mdash;secondary area to ensure that our young men and women have access to training, in the long term, as well as in the short term. High quality investment in additional training now will deliver a work force better suited to the challenges of the future;</PARA>
<PARA>-a further expansion of labour market programs to assist the unemployed obtain and upgrade skills. This will not only help prepare for the recovery but will ensure a proper safety net is provided for those who have been most affected by the recession;</PARA>
<PARA>-the acceleration of infrastructure projects in the areas of road, rail, post-secondary education, and science, with benefits for our traded goods industries and for the quality of teaching and research in our educational and scientific institutions; and</PARA>
<PARA>-facilitation of the development of new industries and restructuring of existing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures total some $313m in calendar year 1992. They are measures which meet the critical tests of advancing our economic strategy, while maintaining the integrity of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Budget, we have been carefully watching economic developments to ensure that the Budget strategy for sustainable recovery with low inflation is on track. It is on track, and we are determined that it stay on track. This Government will not be diverted from its fundamental economic strategy and its goals:</PARA>
<PARA>-sustainable recovery to provide sustainable job growth, and rising living standards</PARA>
<PARA>-and, above all, the goal of building an internationally competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, there may be some who would argue that the Government, satisfied as we are that the fundamental economic strategy is on track, should pay no regard to the representations of the ACTU, and others, on the matters dealt with in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do we reject that argument, but we go further. The very fact that our strategy is on track&mdash;the fact that the great objective of creating a restructured, low inflation, internationally competitive economy is now within our grasp&mdash;is in large measure a result of the constructive cooperation and restraint that has been practised by the working men and women of Australia. That is, precisely, a reason to listen to those who represent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their members have experienced unemployment, not only through the recession, but through the process of long term industrial restructuring we are pursuing. Yet in the representations they have made to us they have not asked for this process to be slowed. They understand, accept and are committed to its continuation, in the knowledge that it is in the long term interest of their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And, of course, Mr President, the views of the union movement reflect the growing concern at all levels of the community, as the statistical projection of unemployment of more than 10 per cent, made in May, has become the harsh reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody feels this concern more deeply than the Prime Minister. It is a concern fully shared by every member of the Government. That is why we accept it as our inescapable duty to take whatever action we responsibly can to restore sustainable job growth as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this Government's unsurpassed record of job creation since 1983, there can be no doubt about our commitment to this goal and our capacity to achieve it. This is a Government which from its inception has been absolutely committed to sustainable job growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budget-time forecasts were for growth of around 3 3/4  per cent through the course of 1991-92. The main sources of growth were expected to be business restocking, housing investment, and moderate growth in private consumption. Net exports were also expected to contribute to growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indicators available since the Budget support those forecasts:  we are coming out of recession. The early stages of recovery are clearly evident in the trend growth now apparent in the housing and retail sectors, and there are now positive signs pointing to recovery in other sectors. Building approvals for private dwellings increased by around 15 per cent in the September quarter. Retail sales have shown renewed strength, growing by 2.9 per cent in real terms in the September quarter. Indexes of consumer sentiment are significantly above their levels of a year ago. Business surveys indicate that the outlook for sales, profits, and investment is beginning to improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our international trading performance has improved markedly. We are on track to record a current account deficit in the order of $14 billion in 1991-92, considerably lower than in recent years both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While unemployment has reached unacceptable levels, the level of employment has stabilised in the last four months, halting the falls in employment that have been occurring since mid-1990. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is consistent with the view that the economy is in the early stages of recovery. This is not to deny that unemployment may rise further. But the essential point is that the evidence of the recovery has begun to appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central objective of the Budget strategy is to ensure that, as the recovery proceeds, the Budget will move back into surplus. This will free national savings for productive investment by the private sector. In this way, the current account will be safeguarded and the economy set on a sustainable growth path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Budget was drawn up, the immediate risk that private calls on national savings would grow faster than public calls were falling has lessened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. I will put my glasses on. I am not like Senator Newman with perfect insight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This lessening is attributable to two main factors:</PARA>
<PARA>-first, the forecast reductions in inflation have been factored into community expectations more rapidly than we had hoped;</PARA>
<PARA>-and second, there has been a worsening of the drought, leading us to be less sanguine about prospects for the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These domestic developments have taken place against the background of some uncertainties about the economic prospects for our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes have not been of a magnitude to cause us to revise the Budget forecasts for overall activity. However, they have reduced the risk that any supplementary measures would see the public sector's call on national resources become unsustainably high. This reduced risk is particularly true of measures targeted to the period immediately ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, there is now some scope to do more to prepare for new jobs and opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, we must continue to recognise the limits which responsible economic management imposes, at this critical point in the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fail to do so would be to throw away the real gains which underlie the present economic situation, and which underpin the splendid prospects ahead for this nation, as a strong, competitive, low inflation economy, enmeshing itself in the economies of the world's fastest growing region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To maximise the benefit to the economy at this stage of the cycle, the measures we announce today are concentrated in calendar year 1992 and, wherever possible, in the first half of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Education and Training</EMPHASIS> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, we have said that a major thrust of these measures is directed towards expansion of education and training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area, we announce today proposals involving gross expenditure in calendar year 1992 of $130m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education and training are basic to the Government's strategy of building a competitive Australia. And they are basic to the more immediate hopes and aspirations of many thousands of individual Australians, especially among our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community demand for education and training is at its highest level ever. The proportion of our young people remaining to the end of secondary school has virtually doubled in a decade and student numbers at our universities have risen by over 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A different situation, however, applies in vocational education and training, including TAFE. While student demand for TAFE and training has continued to increase strongly, labour market conditions and budgetary priorities of State governments, who have the responsibility in this area, have combined to limit the training opportunities made available in this essential sector. In consequence, the level of unmet demand for TAFE has risen steeply in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation demands urgent action. I may say, Mr President, that one of the major disappointments arising from the Premiers' decision not to attend the Special Premiers Conference in Perth next week is that it will make resolution of these problems even more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has been highlighted by the Finn report on post&mdash;compulsory education and training. The Finn report poses major challenges for all governments, State and Commonwealth. We must respond to these challenges. It is time TAFE took its rightful place within the education system of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided to provide extra funding in 1992 to enable additional enrolments in post-school education, mainly in TAFE. In total, a sum of $115m will be provided for post-secondary education and training. A further $15m in higher education capital funding will be brought forward from 1994. This additional funding will be allocated mainly to provide additional TAFE places, and to meet urgent needs for equipment and building refurbishment in both TAFE and universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 1992, the Government expects that these measures will provide an additional 40,000 students with opportunities to gain vocational skills. The States will be required at least to maintain their expenditure in real terms in 1992, pending the negotiation of longer term arrangements. They have also agreed to cooperate in maximising the number of places provided from the additional Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking to the longer term, the Commonwealth will continue to pursue its offer to the States of a new set of funding arrangements for vocational education and training, designed to upgrade the capacity and status of our</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Labour Market Programs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the unemployed have borne the heaviest cost of the recession. Despite the economic recovery which is now under way, the number of long term unemployed will continue to rise for some time to come. If we are to harness in full the opportunities provided by recovery, we must strengthen the skills of job seekers and particularly the long term unemployed. It makes economic sense to do so&mdash;by ensuring that skills shortages do not emerge during the recovery. More importantly, social justice demands that we do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we announce enhancements to the employment access program, Skillshare and the self-employment assistance program to enable larger numbers of the long term unemployed to obtain the skills needed to take advantage of new job and business opportunities as these emerge from the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enhancements will provide increased opportunities for some 56,000 unemployed people in 1992, including:</PARA>
<PARA>.an increase in training places that will prepare an additional 31,000 people for labour market re-entry;</PARA>
<PARA>.an increase in the Jobstart program, providing an additional 15,500 job subsidy placements;</PARA>
<PARA>.an increase in the special intervention program to provide an additional 9,000 especially disadvantaged with assistance early in their period of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>With these enhancements, in addition to those announced with the implementation of the Newstart program, at least 300,000 unemployed people will be assisted by the CES through labour market programs in 1992. This additional assistance will involve gross expenditure of $78m in 1991-92 and $124m in 1992-93.

This spending will provide industry with a better, more efficient transport system. In doing so, it will support the continued expansion of our export sector. At the same time, it will provide a direct boost to employment and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also announce today that we will provide $10m immediately to CSIRO to upgrade its facilities. These funds will be fully spent in 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is acutely aware of the problems that are being encountered as the Australian economy undertakes its essential restructuring:</PARA>
<PARA>-our exporters are entering new, highly competitive markets;</PARA>
<PARA>-many of our traditional firms are confronting radical change and a requirement to make substantial new investments;</PARA>
<PARA>-new firms are struggling to establish themselves and, often, new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA>Today we announce measures designed to assist in each of these areas. The Government will allocate an additional $10m to the Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF) in 1992. The funds will enable us to offer finance to Australian firms for significant new projects in China, India and South East Asia. The decision will allow the DIFF to meet more of the demand on its funds. The existing backlog meant that projects in power, communications, transport and resource processing had been held over. In all those sectors, Australia is rapidly establishing international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, since the Prime Minister's March statement, a number of companies in the textile, clothing and footwear industries have demonstrated their commitment to the Government's objective of creating strong and viable industries&mdash;industries which will be competitive and in which jobs will be secure. To reinforce this commitment, the Government will bring forward $15m in calendar year 1992, to be available for restructuring purposes approved by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) has recorded a profit of $9.6m for 1990-91. The Corporation has asked to retain this profit as additional capital to help meet the demand for equity in new project development. We recognise that additional capital is needed particularly for new investments in resource processing. The Government has therefore agreed that the profit should be retained by the Corporation. The Government has also decided to extend the Commonwealth guarantee on the Corporation's liabilities to 1998. This recognises the importance of the Corporation's role in industry development, by enabling it to minimise its borrowing costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the March statement, the Prime Minister announced a major extension of sales tax exemptions available to business. The legislation is currently before the Senate. Allowing for the flow-on effects of reducing costs earlier in the production chain, the exemptions will provide a total benefit to business of more than $1 billion in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement today focuses, and properly does so at this time, on the matter of most immediate concern to the people of Australia, the problem of unemployment. We do not seek to disguise the magnitude of the problem. We should all acknowledge the fact that even when the recovery is fully under way and job growth restored substantial reduction of unemployment levels will take time. To grasp this reality, one has only to recall the post-recession experience last time. Even when this Government had achieved average job creation of 230,000 a year, as it did over the period to mid-1990, the associated fall in unemployment was gradual compared with the spectacular growth in jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in acknowledging that, let me say that it is time&mdash;beyond time&mdash;to stop talking down the Australian economy. The central fact is that the Budget strategy is on course. The economy is recovering, and we will emerge from the recession with a stronger economy than before. Let me illustrate this truth by pointing to the results of the structural reforms we have already achieved. Exports of manufactured goods have increased by 112 per cent in real terms since 1983-84. Within manufacturing, exports of manufactured metals have risen by 62 per cent and exports of the more complex non-metal manufactured goods have increased by 147 per cent. Over the same period, exports of services have increased by 77 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The official OECD statistics show that Australia's manufactured export performance in the past five years has been by far the best in the OECD. They show that, in real terms, annual growth of manufactured exports has averaged over 15 per cent in Australia compared with the OECD average of 6 per cent. Australia's rate of manufactured export growth has even outpaced that of the four newly industrialising economies of Asia&mdash;South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. These trends emerged well before the recession and have continued throughout the recession. These facts are a remarkable tribute to the drive and initiative of much of our business sector. It is a performance which presents an example and a challenge to the whole business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, the performance in many service areas, notably tourism, has also been strong. Overseas tourist arrivals have more than doubled in just five years. The numbers are expected almost to treble again by the year 2000, to around six million. These projections lend compelling force to the Government's decisions in relation to aviation. Following yesterday's decision by Federal Cabinet to approve the construction of a third runway at Sydney Airport, the Federal Airports Corporation expects preliminary work to begin within a month and major construction contracts to be let early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as generating many thousands of sustainable new jobs at the airport and in directly related activities in the years ahead, the third runway will provide the capacity to meet the projected strong growth in tourist traffic. In addition, the Government will shortly examine a proposal for the development of a general aviation airport at Badgerys Creek, Sydney's designated international airport. Based on preliminary design work already completed, it is envisaged that this new aerodrome would be operational in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strong performance in the manufacturing and service industries has been buttressed by the continuing strength of the mining sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Government has recently announced a new process aimed at encouraging major development projects including mining and minerals processing, agriculture and forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process for approving major projects in these areas will be speeded up, although I emphasise that proper environmental standards and Aboriginal and heritage issues will not be by-passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strength of the manufacturing, services and mining industries stands in sharp contrast to the current plight of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many farmers have been hit by drought, compounding the severe downturn in farm prices, caused mainly by the trade war between the European Community and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of our commitment to easing the burden on the rural sector, the Government has massively increased funding for the rural adjustment scheme&mdash;from $62m in 1990&mdash;91 to $173m in 1991&mdash;92. Further, we have just announced arrangements to link RAS assessments to social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be acknowledged, however, that enduring relief will not occur unless there is liberalisation of agricultural trade. The farmers of Australia can be assured that this Government will continue to do all we can, in the coming crucial weeks of the Uruguay Round, to ensure it reaches a successful conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have an historic opportunity to move into the twenty-first century with a dynamic, reinvigorated, modern Australian economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This statement is the response of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the demands of Mr Keating that jobs go to the top of the agenda, to the similar demand by the ACTU and to the Premiers' demand. It has to be so, because we have just been told in the statement that, according to the Government, the Budget strategy is on track. If the Budget strategy is on track, this statement is unnecessary. But we know that it is Mr Hawke's practice to respond to these demands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it does, however, is give us the opportunity to assess a number of things: firstly, whether Mr Hawke really appreciates the pain and suffering that is occurring in the Australian community today, or is he now so out of touch with everyday life; and, secondly, whether he understands how deep-seated this recession is&mdash;that it is no longer a `last on first off' recession. Does he understand the creation of what could be a generation of unemployed if this figure of 30-odd per cent of young people unemployed continues into the new year?  Thirdly, does Mr Hawke really understand how particular sectors of the economy are being devastated by this recession&mdash;for example, the rural sector of the economy, and provincial and country towns?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at this statement in light of that assessment criteria, one cannot help but conclude that it is a statement which is superficial, inadequate, far too late, driven by politics&mdash;it is full of Hawkespeak&mdash;and in which there is no demonstration of any long term commitment to really restructuring Australia in such a way that Australia might be internationally competitive again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the statement do? It provides a few more TAFE places for next year's unemployed youth&mdash;far less than the number the Government has already admitted will be unemployed&mdash;with a background of an enormous number of young people who could not get into TAFE last year. It provides a little more training for today's unemployed. It brings forward some money for roads and rail, and that is about it. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) spoke of a little DIFF money and a little TCF money. We have already seen that that TCF money does not necessarily lead to the preservation or provision of extra jobs, as my friend Senator Tierney interjected in relation to the Newcastle experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Prime Minister really understand that such an inadequate statement comes with the background of the worst recession this country has faced since the Great Depression? Does he understand the level of unemployment that there is now in the community? Does he understand the consequences of the continuing current account deficit? In fact, in this statement he boasts that the current account deficit will be reduced to some $14 billion this year&mdash;a deficit of $14 billion on top of all the previous deficits. Does he understand just how far in debt this nation is now and how difficult it will be to ever repay that debt and provide a legacy for our successors of the type of lifestyle that we were lucky enough to inherit from our parents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no indication in this statement that Mr Hawke understands these issues at all. This statement is about the same rhetoric as the past: how we are sharing the agony. Mr Hawke is not materially, of course; Mr Hawke is sharing it spiritually. We hear about his 33 years of commitment to public life. Would he put Australians in this position so that unemployment would continue in light of his 33 years in public life? He asks us to believe he would not do that, but he has put Australians in a position where it has occurred. It is his Government, his policies and his recession. The recession that he and his then Treasurer said we had to have has put nearly one million Australians out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does he offer us in this statement&mdash;practically nothing. As I have said, it is full of Hawkespeak. It starts with the first sentence of the statement: `Australia today is at a point of historic convergence'&mdash;whatever that might mean. It then goes on to talk about the long, hard struggle when we worked together, but it says there is a bright new future. Do the one million unemployed Australians see that bright new future? Do they refer to it as a `splendid future' as Mr Hawke says on the last page of this document? Mr Deputy President, they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an unreal reaction from a man whose time in public life has passed, from a man who has lost touch with reality and the hundreds of thousands of Australians who are now suffering as a result of his failings. As a result of that, I will be moving at the end of my speech an amendment to the motion which Senator Button has moved. Senator Button has moved that the Senate take note of the statement. I will add:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and condemn the Government for causing unnecessary pain and anguish to hundreds of thousands of Australians as a result of its incompetent management of the economy and through the absence of major tax reform, labour market reform and other structural adjustment, offering them so little hope for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>This has been a bad year for Mr Hawke; we all understand that. More importantly, it has been a worse year for the nearly one million Australians who are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take a few minutes of the Senate's time to look at the principal failings, as I see them, of this Government. The first is that it has failed to set the parameters for a strong, internationally competitive Australia. It started trying to do so with deregulation of the financial sector, but could not go on with it because it was locked in by its vested interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, it erred in continually forcing up interest rates to try to curb imports at a time when all Australians were telling Mr Hawke and his Treasurer that it was crushing the business sector and, what is more important, crushing good business and good business people. They said they could not survive under that level of interest rates, but Mr Hawke and Mr Keating remained deaf. Mr Hawke has driven those people out of business. Many of them have had their lives ruined and they will never be able to return to where they were before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Government has failed because it is now in a state of paralysis due to this awful leadership struggle that continues in the most undignified terms of the thugs of the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. Every day we hear of this contest that is publicly splitting the Party on both sides between Mr Keating, who was promised the job by Mr Hawke and says that he is entitled to a turn in the Lodge&mdash;after the recession that he has given us, that is amazing&mdash;and Mr Hawke who, when it came to the crunch, was not prepared to forgo power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Divided the Party they have, with half on each side. They have divided the Cabinet&mdash;and we have the campaign managers within the Cabinet in this chamber&mdash;the Caucus and the organisation. They are slinging it out in the media. Every day they condemn each other and force a situation of paralysis whereby Mr Hawke, even if he was able to, is not able to make the decisions that he should as Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each step is as a result of pressure. On interest rates, we heard what Mr Keating said, Mr Hawke responded. With the Commonwealth-State tax relations, Mr Keating lifted the heat and Mr Hawke responded. Even with the jobs policy&mdash;as I said at the outset&mdash;Mr Keating came on and said, `It's now time to move to a jobs policy' and Mr Hawke felt that he had no alternative but to respond. Mr Keating was driving the agenda with Mr Hawke responding and no decision was made on its economic merits or in the national interest. Every decision is now made on the basis of what will keep the hounds at bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, just look back over this last year for a few minutes. The first big statement we had was the March industry statement. That was hijacked by the leadership contest. Senator Button was supposed to give it&mdash;it was his industry statement. Mr Hawke needed it to promote his leadership in the light of the foreshadowed contest. It was, in its terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">directed to the fundamental task facing this nation: improving the productive capacity of an economy that will be more internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds fine, but did it do that? Did it really wrestle with the issue of tax reform? Did it wrestle with the issues of labour market reform and infrastructure reform that are so necessary in this country? Of course it did not. Again, it was couched in all the familiar Hawkespeak of a shared challenge and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the integral part of the statement concerning depreciation rates. For months there were quarrels between the Australian Taxation Office, the Treasury, the Department of Technology, Industry and Commerce and so forth until only now, months later, has industry received those rates. Even the depreciation law is in a form with major shortcomings, as Senator Watson, among others, has demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, do you remember that other important part of the March statement&mdash;the promised resource security legislation? It was legislation which was only necessary because of the promises that Senator Richardson made to the environmental movement at the last election which brought to a halt all resource development projects in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response of Mr Hawke was to promise resource security legislation. He said in the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government decided on resource security legislation only after receiving unqualified legal advice that it was the sole way the Commonwealth could provide a binding undertaking of the kind necessary to get major projects started which will provide new exports and new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>What has happened? Here we are in November with no legislation, no progress, no major projects, no new exports and, of course, no new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the August Budget statement. The contents of what we have heard today should have been incorporated therein. Was that Budget one that really addressed the major crisis that was facing this country?  Of course it was not, because it was again linked with the leadership problem. The highlight of the statement was funding of $816m to a mad cities fantasy of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, which was the price of his support for leadership and the price of support for the Left. What will be the consequence of that program if it is implemented? The consequence will be to drive up prices of inner city properties which will have exactly the opposite effect that this Government claims it wants to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the other highlight of the Budget statement? I remind you, Mr Deputy President, that it was the compulsory occupational superannuation tax, which was to be implemented regardless of the state of the economy or the capacity of Australia's crushed industry to bear it. We will never forget that moment of frankness and honesty in the Budget statement when the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) said to us that 1990-91 was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a disappointing year for all Australians; a year of lost jobs, squeezed profits and dashed hopes.</PARA>
<PARA>That was August. We now have a job statement several months later because nothing worth while has happened in the meantime. That gives Australians no more hope than the acknowledgment of that depressing state of affairs in the Budget. Nothing has changed. Job losses are continuing, business is being squeezed of its profits, more Australians are being reduced to the scrap heap of unemployment and more hopes are being shattered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that Senator Button said earlier this week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confess that the majority of the community are not greatly enchanted with this Government at this present time.</PARA>
<PARA>Neither should they be. As I said, what has happened since is more lost opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to the new federalism process that was supposed to restructure Federal-State relations? Prime Minister Hawke has the gall in this statement to blame the Premiers. After the July Premiers Conference, he promised them tax reform, but he was forced away from that by Mr Keating. I tabled in the Parliament earlier this week the letter of Mr Keating that forced him to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, not surprisingly, Mr Hawke having reneged on his promise, the Premiers pulled back. So any opportunity for sensible tax reform and other sensible rationalisation of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the States is lost. It is not surprising that Mr Hawke is, therefore, condemned by all the State Premiers or that the State Premiers, including the Labor Premiers, recognise the problem as being the leadership contest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have Senator Button's new fast tracking proposal for industry, grabbed as something that might achieve benefits. It affects a limited number of companies. There is nothing that guarantees its passage through this structural adjustment committee of Cabinet. There is nothing that Australians can really look to as providing any great hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to today's big statement, the third and final for the year, in which Australians can now look for hope. I have said that it contains so little. It reminds us of the third runway which, after years of this Government prevaricating, is now being referred to as a fast track operation. It is a project in which Mr Hawke is still not able to indicate that he has the support of the whole ministry. Was there anything in this statement about a change to a more realistic uranium project? No. What about Coronation Hill? Did that get a mention? No. These are the projects that are reduced to the too hard basket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the much vaunted industrial law reform that Senator Cook tells us is so important, this Government cannot get through its accord partner, the ACTU. So, what hope is there for the Australian people out of this statement? There is no hope. What is the future for a Prime Minister who cannot work with the Premiers to the benefit of all Australians? What is the future for a government where the Prime Minister has demonstrated that he does not have the capacity to govern even his party?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy that this Government will not stand up and meet its national responsibility at this time of great need. It will not stand up and meet the need for significant tax reform which the Government acknowledged itself, only a few years ago, was absolutely necessary. It is a tragedy that it will not stand up to the need for real labour market reform to really encourage enterprise bargaining, not Senator Cook's restraints to try to protect vested interests. It is such a tragedy that it will not stand up to the need for major structural reform which is so critical to the economic future of this country. That is why it is necessary for the Opposition to take this opportunity to move the amendment. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At end of motion, add `and condemn the Government for causing unnecessary pain and anguish to hundreds of thousands of Australians as a result of its incompetent management of the economy and through the absence of major tax reform, labour market reform and other structural adjustment, offering so little hope for the future'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague, Senator Hill, and I certainly support his amendment. I have looked closely through the statement by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) looking for some hope, some ray of relief, for Australia's one million unemployed and 125,000 farmers, who are going into debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the statement begins with rhetoric and it ends with rhetoric, and there is very little in between the beginning and the end. It is a disappointing statement, and it gives no hope to those young people who are now leaving school and seeking a job. They will also add to the 28 per cent of youth unemployment, and the Government's answer to that is to provide more tertiary places. What Australia needs is jobs, not the most expensive child-minding in the community. It needs real jobs that will be sustainable, that will be there, and that will give some people some courage to go out and look to the future. But what have we found in this statement? Very, very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 125,000 farmers now hurting by the uncontrolled interest rates, by the drought in many areas of Australia, and by low commodity prices, and the Government's answer to that is that we cannot be too sanguine. What a terribly deprecating way to face one of the major problems in Australia&mdash;a throwaway line that we cannot be sanguine. Of course we cannot be sanguine. If Australian farmers go down the chute at the rate that they are going down at the moment, this nation will have no future. It will have no export income&mdash;not now and not for a long time into the future. What the Government has done is to provide some rural adjustment money to assist farmers out of trouble, trouble that I may say the Government itself created by high interest rates. What small business, what farmer, can pay up to 23 per cent in interest rates and expect to survive? What we have seen the Government do is provide some social security money, some desperation money, to give those people some sort of living. It is not good enough to create the problem and then give the farmers social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bankruptcies are up 50 per cent in a two-year period. We have seen a 38 per cent increase in bankruptcies this year and 19 per cent last year. No wonder there are a million unemployed. The answer to that, of course, is that the Government is continually increasing charges by inflicting on small business a five per cent superannuation levy, to be stepped up to nine per cent by the year 2000. The businesses which are hanging on by their fingernails now will have to increase their overheads by up to nine per cent. Many of them, I tell Senator Cook, are just surviving now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the considerations the Government has hung its hat on is that it has inflation down, but what a terribly horrific price to pay&mdash;a million unemployed, record bankruptcies, and all the Government has to show for it is inflation is down to a lower figure. One of the last paragraphs of the statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has to be acknowledged, however, that enduring relief will not occur unless there is liberalisation of agriculture trade. The farmers of Australia can be assured that this Government will continue to do all we can, in the coming crucial weeks of the Uruguay Round, to ensure it reaches a successful conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope for this Government's sake, and for the sake of Australia's farmers, that the Government is confident that it can swing the Uruguay Round to a point where we do get some liberalisation, for the reason that no other government in the world has exposed its farmers to so much risk and got so little return in the free trade talks. This Government will be so embarrassed if the Uruguay Round does not reach a successful conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This Government has reduced tariffs by 60 per cent when the rest of the world has increased its protection by 48 per cent. This Government has reduced tariffs to zero when the rest of the world is flooding Australian markets with its own primary production. I say to Senator Cook, who represents in this chamber the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), that if this Uruguay Round does not reach some conclusion there had better be some fast thinking in the Cabinet to take some action that will stop the flood of imported products into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I have touched on some of the problems that are facing small business and the farming community, but there has not been any reaction or commitment in this document to addressing those problems. It is a very shallow document which represents the Government's third try this year to engender some confidence in the business sector. The more of these documents that appear, the more the Government's credibility decreases and its capacity to engender confidence is lessened. I am terribly disappointed about this document, and anyone on the Government side who is open and honest will share my disappointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does this document say there is any hope? Yes, there will be a few jobs created on the third runway&mdash;very necessary for Australia. There will be $130m put into education, but that will not provide the real jobs. What about the hundreds of thousands of children in years 11 and 12 who will face a 28 per cent rate of unemployment? Where is the hope in this document? I hope someone in the Labor Party can tell me by answering our queries. Where is the hope for those small business people, the ones who are just surviving now, the ones who are looking for some hope in the future? There is nothing in that statement for the business sector of Australia. In fact, there is nothing in that document for anyone, except a few school teachers and TAFE teachers who will be employed. It is just not good enough, and all it will do is drive Australia further down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully support Senator Hill's amendment. I think it could be couched in even stronger terms. It could even be turned into a censure motion; I think it would gain full support from everyone on this side of the House, including the Democrats. There is not a lot more that I can say about this document put down by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), except that he is running out of steam. It is a tired government. It is a government that has lost any vision for Australia. It is a government that has lost its direction, and a government that is hanging in there for another six or eight months until an election is called. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic policies of governments could not have been more successful if they had deliberately set out to impede economic progress, make it more difficult for businesses to operate profitably, encourage high levels of private consumption for most people while accepting homelessness and poverty for others, reduce the level and quality of public services, encourage imports and discourage exports, discriminate against Australian investment while supporting foreign take-overs of Australian property, destroy the competitive edge of Australia's super-efficient farm and mining industries, prevent manufacturing industries from becoming more efficient, continue to degrade the natural environment, and tolerate massive levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>What a catalogue! Against that accurate description of what has happened to the Australian economy since 1983, we have the Prime Minister claiming that the economy is on track. He even has the gall to say that he is observing the facts. What facts is he observing? Again, I suggest that he is simply looking at these obscure economic indices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before in this place on many occasions, the policies being followed by this Government, which have led to this absolutely disastrous situation, are precisely the same policies which would be followed by the Opposition if it were in government. That is exactly what Professor Mathews goes on to say in this article. He says that the first explanation for the present predicament lies in the advice the economics profession gives to governments. He says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the past 20 years or so, economics has come to be dominated by free-market economists&mdash;the economic rationalists.</PARA>
<PARA>As we have seen from the publication of a recent book by Michael Pusey, he has identified 70 per cent of all the senior people in government departments having that particular view of the world&mdash;that economic rationalist econometric view of the world. Professor Mathews goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complex econometric models have been constructed to demonstrate the inevitability of unemployment, without recognising that the models cannot adequately represent the real world and that the assumptions that are made to simplify the real world determine the conclusions of the analysis.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has fallen right into that trap. Professor Mathews continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The models therefore reflect the ideologies on which the assumptions are based&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>listen to this, because it bears very much on what we hear repeatedly from the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for example, that there is perfect competition and that markets operate efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have an explanation of what has gone wrong with the Australian economy and why this Government has been led to a situation in which we have this massive unemployment, which a continuation of those policies cannot redress and will not redress. We need a rejection of those economic rationalist policies and a return to a situation in which the elected government, the elected representatives of the people, place their hands on the economic levers of this country and resume control of the economy and simply do not leave it to those naked economic forces which cannot deliver in relation to the problem of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister goes on to talk about initiatives in the post-secondary area to ensure that our young men and women have access to training. I have recently become the Leader of this Party and we have advertised for 12 people on the Leader's staff. We have had over 200 applications for one of those positions. When I read through those applications, I found that the majority were from university educated people, many of them have several degrees, and many of them are already working in quite menial jobs. Whilst it is certainly true that this Government has run down tertiary education in particular&mdash;the universities and the research institutes&mdash;we do not need more people crammed into those tertiary institutions at this stage. That is not where the problem lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, one could say that the tertiary institutions in this country are essentially awash with people. Many of the applicants for the positions that I have just mentioned are recent graduates, highly qualified people, who simply cannot find a job. To suggest that there is a problem in that post-secondary area, in terms of training, is simply to misread the signs. If anybody looked at any applications for job positions, that situation would become quite obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister talks about accelerating infrastructure projects in the area of road, rail, post-secondary education and science. Certainly, as a country, we spend far too little on science research and development. That is a point that I have made on a number of occasions, as have many other honourable senators in this place. Despite that, we are the most productive country in the world if we look at the number of scientific papers which are published in scientific journals, in referee journals. But we are failing&mdash;and we have failed over a number of years&mdash;to translate many of those scientific developments into commercial products. Clearly, we need to bridge that gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the efforts of the Government, it has simply failed to deliver on that front. The Government has failed to deliver on that front because it has no clear idea of where Australia needs to go; no clear idea of where Australia needs to be positioned 15 to 20 years down the track. The Government is pursuing its deregulatory, market-driven approach to the economy and assuming that the market will throw up, in some random fashion, the answers to Australia's destiny. It just does not work; the evidence is quite clear that it does not work. The Government must develop a much clearer idea, in consultation with the community, as to where we need to get 10, 15, 20 and 25 years down the track. I am continually reminded of the Swedish Commission for the Future which has a 25-year time horizon and a 40-year time horizon. It develops attitudes in the Swedish community in relation to those very long term social goals. We have nothing like that in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the amounts which the Government is talking about. For calendar year 1992, an amount of $313m has been allocated for the facilitation and development of new industries and restructuring existing industries. This is still well down the track. That is the first point one would make. The deregulatory policies of this Government have led to entrepreneur after entrepreneur going down the gurgler to the tune of $2 billion to $3 billion. Where has that money come from? Of course, it has come from the Australian community. It has been misdirected into speculation because of the deregulatory policies of this Government and it has simply been wasted. Compared with the amount of money which has been wasted and which we see appearing in our newspapers day by day as evidence of waste, the amounts which the Prime Minister's paper talks about are paltry in the extreme&mdash;$313m in calendar year 1992. Elsewhere in the document we find other amounts measured in tens of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on the subject of education, one of the members of the Opposition mentioned the Australian National University in Question Time today. I have a number of colleagues working in universities. Every single one of them tells a story of larger and larger classes, poorer and poorer facilities, lack of maintenance of buildings and equipment and far too little time to carry on any worthwhile research projects; they are simply being worn out by their large teaching loads. That is not the way to progress towards a clever country. As I have said before, we do not need to become a clever country&mdash;we are really quite a clever people&mdash;we need a much wiser government, something which we simply do not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about education and training, the Prime Minister today announced proposals involving gross expenditure in calendar year 1992 of $130m&mdash;a paltry sum. Since 1983 the education and research facilities of this country have been run down and run down. At the same time, in an attempt to disguise unemployment, more and more people have been jammed into tertiary education, with no hope of a job at the other end. It really is a woeful and abysmal statement. It indicates that the Prime Minister and his Government have no clear idea of where Australia is going or how it is going to get there; it is simply, `Leave it to the market and we'll try to pick up one or two of the pieces in a very ineffective, paltry and inadequate way'. It will not work; it is not a solution to the problem. The solution to the problem lies in putting one's hands back on the economic levers and taking control of the economy, to re-regulate in selective ways so as to better serve the real interests of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by quoting a little more of Professor Mathews, who has written a brilliant article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. He points to the fact that the Government and, indeed, the Opposition should have known that this would not work. He states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement delivered here today is the statement of a fraud.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's statement is riddled with inconsistencies, it has no substance at all, and it shows that the only reason that it has been made is that the Prime Minister felt the blowtorch applied to him to get up and say something.

That is a fairly optimistic assumption, given the fact that last month alone the deficit zoomed up again from the reductions it had had in the couple of months preceding that, and the deficit last month was double what it had been the month before.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures build on the strategy for reducing unemployment already put in place by the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>If this builds on the strategy that is contained in this year's Budget, then heaven help us as to where we are going to go from here. The total measures announced today will cost $313m in the calendar year 1992. It appears from what the Prime Minister has said in this statement that that is an unfunded series of expenditures. There has been no compensating measures in the fiscal policy in any sense to compensate for this additional spending, yet the Prime Minister says that these measures will not only advance our economic strategy but also maintain the integrity of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integrity of the Budget was never there, but it has blown out very considerably since then. One could have no confidence in the forecast on which the Budget was based. Indeed, in relation to one of the key forecasts and parameters underlying the Budget Estimates&mdash;namely, investment&mdash;there is a major admission on page 4 that private sector investment is going to be much less this year than even was forecast in the Budget. The Budget forecasts themselves showed a fall of 10 1/2 per cent expected in private investment in 1991-92. The statement today reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Budget was drawn up, the immediate risk that private calls on national savings would grow faster than public calls were falling has lessened.</PARA>
<PARA>That could only mean that private sector investment is expected to fall by even more than the disastrous 10 1/2 per cent that the Government itself admitted to in the Budget. That fall of 10 1/2 per cent expected in 1991-92 was on top of a fall of similar magnitude the year before. There has been a tremendous collapse in investment in this nation over the last two or three years. That is the factor that underpins any prospect of job creation and economic growth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are not going to get investment in the nation, then we are not going to get jobs. The reason today's statement is a litany of despair is that there is not one measure in it designed to lift investment in Australia. The one thing that underpins our requirement for economic recovery is missing. Indeed, it is not even acknowledged in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in the figures accompanying the statement even greater cause for concern. The figures in the accompanying statistical statement are very difficult to interpret. They are very cursory. They are insufficient to give a proper analysis; they are too general and too vague. But there are some very worrying statistics in them. In particular, the measures estimate that, as a result of today's announcements, there will be a fall of $113m in the calendar year 1992 in unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That simply means that that will be compensated on the other side of the equation by an expansion of the employment access program, by additional Austudy and by further initiatives in post-secondary education and training of a very significant amount&mdash;$100m plus. In other words, the Government's own document is saying that the Government is simply going to move people from one pile to another. It will move them out of the dole and into these other programs. It is fine and a very important thing to increase the level of skills, education and training in our community, but we must accompany it by other measures that are designed to create jobs. There is nothing in this at all to actually create more jobs. What this statement will do is jam the pipeline with more trained people but with nothing for them to do when they come out of that pipeline of training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the only sustainable way to lift economic growth in this country, to create the jobs that are so desperately needed, is to implement measures to lift investment. There is nothing at all in this statement which does that. The statement talks about social justice. After acknowledging that the unemployed have borne the heaviest costs of the recession, the Prime Minister has the hide to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are to harness in full the opportunities provided by recovery, we must strengthen the skills of job seekers and particularly the long term unemployed. It makes economic sense to do so. . . More importantly, social justice demands that we do so.</PARA>
<PARA>I will tell the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate what social justice demands. Social justice demands a government that is prepared to do things to create growth and jobs. It does not demand governments that undertake mickey mouse measures to try to move people out of unemployment and into training schemes with no hope, no opportunity and no incentive for them at the end of the pipeline. That is the cruelest thing one can possibly do. That is where this Government fails lamentably, cruelly and despairingly in relation to its mouthing of the words `social justice'. The Government does not know what the words `social justice' really mean. In September the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, made a very important speech&mdash;it was a very important statement&mdash;to the Irish Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the most effective anti-poverty policy ever implemented has been sustained economic growth. It has brought increased social justice to hundreds of millions of people on our planet.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement delivered today does nothing to advance the cause of economic development, economic recovery, growth and job creation in this nation.

We need a fundamental reform of taxation and of our whole infrastructure and industry structure in this country. Mucking around in the way the Government has in this statement will achieve nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in recent days the coalition has, in preparation for this great statement, run some figures through the most sophisticated economic model in Australia, the so-called Murphy model. We put a series of figures through just to see what would happen to unemployment. One of those scenarios was: let us see what happens if we give an unfunded $250m boost to public spending. What would that do to the September 1991 unemployment rate?  The model showed that an unfunded boost to public spending of $250m would decrease the unemployment rate from 10.1 per cent to 10.09 per cent&mdash;the ultimate bandaid solution; not one iota of improvement in the unemployment situation. Similarly, when we put a boost of $500m through, it showed that would have no effect on the unemployment rate in 1991-92 and, at best, it would only decrease the unemployment rate by 0.03 per cent in 1992-93; in other words, one-third of one-tenth of one per cent in 1992-93&mdash;again, no impact at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, if one put a billion-dollar boost into public spending in the way the Government is doing today, there would be no improvement in unemployment. It proves that there has to be major taxation and structural reform if we are to get anywhere in this country with restoring growth, jobs, investment, hope and opportunity. We need reform that will lower the tax burden on individuals and business; that will lower the cost of business inputs in the production chain. We need reform that will make the tax system fairer, more equitable and more broadly based, simpler and more efficient. We need that reform to give employers and employees the opportunity to discuss together, to negotiate together, to work out together the deal and the arrangements that suit them best so that we can maximise the opportunity, use and scope for greater productivity, growth and improved living standards in this nation. </PARA>

Workers have been told what wage they must work for and employers what wages they must pay.

Labor's accord, through its inability to adjust to our present difficulties, becomes one of the principal factors directly responsible for the extended period of economic stagnation in which we find ourselves&mdash;directly responsible for the fact that one million Australians who want to work are unable to find a job. It is easy to bandy about a statistic like one million, yet it is a figure that staggers the imagination. One million people are going through their own private hell under a government that is not prepared to lift a finger to help them. Each one of those one million people is struggling to make ends meet, trying to aspire to the good things in life or to provide them for their children. They are battling to salvage self-esteem in a society where self-esteem is based on social and economic status, on what you do for a living. </PARA>

Families will break down, some people will turn to crime, others will adopt even more final and desperate solutions. Any religious or social welfare organisation will say that unemployment places a tremendous and often intolerable strain on family relationships. With little money coming into a household, husband and wife will take out their financial pressures on each other. Mutual recriminations and fault-finding on both sides will tragically in some cases give way to domestic violence. Some will be unable to resolve their difficulties. Separation and divorce statistics will show an increase&mdash;statistics that give only a hint of the terrible anguish and despair underlying them. Children will suffer. Unable to understand the causes of their parents' distress, they will only witness the fighting and misery and they will live with the consequences. </PARA>

A whole generation of our young people are finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to find work. The next group of young people about to emerge from secondary school will do so with the expectation of extreme difficulty in finding work and, for many, the expectation of an extended period of unemployment. Many have already experienced this. Some who have been unable to find a job for a long time, perhaps have never even held a job, are beginning to wonder why they bother searching for work, day in and day out, only to face continued rejection in an environment that cannot afford to pay them the going rate, and will not allow them to negotiate themselves into employment. Without a job, they will have no autonomy, no social status and no perceived future. A job is everything, even to the young. It is an identity; it is a freedom; it is a sense of purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has recently been unable to decide whether or not we are in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years. As he struggles to make up his mind, and others move quickly to make it up for him, the one million unemployed of this country must wonder what difference it makes. They know that they are suffering under the bankrupt policies of a bankrupt government&mdash;a government that has manifestly failed to deliver to them the single greatest promise on which it was originally elected. It has failed to provide them with jobs. That was the great promise of Labor's accord&mdash;that by restraining real wages it would deliver a higher profit share to employers, thereby stimulating growth and creating jobs. When all else failed, when the Government  could not control the current account or get inflation down or move fast enough with structural reforms, it clung to the accord and pinned all its hopes on it. Now, the Government's promise of more jobs through the centralised control of wages, after floundering for so long on a sea of missed opportunities, has sunk. As Frank Devine put it recently in his column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian,</EMPHASIS> the Government has `succeeded only in creating half a million new jobs, a million of which have now disappeared'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is not in a recession, however; it is in a bona fide depression, the magnitude of which is eclipsed only by the terrible events of the 1930s. In labelling our current economic malaise a depression, I do not look to any economic indicators&mdash;the ongoing pessimism indicated in employer surveys, the increase in the number of long term unemployed, the continuing fall off in job levels in key sectors such as the automobile parts industry, the unprecedented combination of difficulties faced by our farming communities&mdash;I look instead to the psychological impact of our economic woes. Not since the 1930s has there been such a destruction of confidence in Australia's future among significant sections of our community.  In Victoria and in my own State of South Australia, where State Labor governments have gambled away the living standards of the next generation, people are beginning to wonder whether there is anything that governments, State or Federal, can do to alter what they perceive as a very bleak future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that by 1993 as many as 350,000 people may be classified as long term unemployed. Although I do not want to dwell on economic indicators, that is a figure worth reflecting on.  More and more people are joining the list of the long term unemployed, that is, those who have been unemployed for more than a year.  A significant number of these are young people who have never had a job in their lives.  What is their view of the adult world into which they have been thrust?  What are their hopes for the future?  What damage has the depressed state of our nation done to their dreams and aspirations, their attitudes to work, their faith in this country, and in their own capacity to participate?</PARA>

Can there be any doubt that if we create an atmosphere in which one in every three young Australians is unable to find work, when we rob young people of all hope, of all faith in themselves, that many will turn to crime?  So much of the crime we are seeing today is merely the most desperate articulation of a cry for help that is being heard from all sections of the community. Such is the psychological impact of this, our worst economic dilemma since the Great Depression. To all of this the Federal Government simply proffers its failed accord and this pathetic statement today, its proud record of half a million jobs created and a million destroyed, with vague promises of revitalising industry, of creating greater flexibility, of achieving the structural reform so desperately needed, of additional education in the TAFE sector: all talk but very little concrete action. </PARA>

They fail to acknowledge that the Australian economy has faltered, not for want of government intervention but because of it, and it is inappropriate and badly managed intervention.  This is why the accord has failed and why the alternative solutions of the Left and the ACTU will also fail. The unemployed of Australia will not get their hope back when they see failed governments interfering even more in the day to day running of the economy.  What will restore their faith is to be given an opportunity to wrest back control over their own lives, to negotiate their own wages and conditions, instead of being told that Labor's accord has priced them out of the market. This is the single most important reform to be implemented in Australia.  It is also the reform that this Government is least willing and least able to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must surely be regarded as the big lie of Australian politics that we, the coalition, are the ones who espouse so-called dry policies to the detriment of real men and women and that it is the Government that has compassion and an eye for ordinary people.  Nowhere is this big lie exposed more starkly than in the areas of industrial relations and this Government's dismal record on unemployment. For the sake of placating the ACTU, this Government would ignore the plight of one million people who are unemployed. Rather than create the flexible framework so desperately needed and run the risk of upsetting its industrial masters, it would ignore the cries of people who want to work and who would willingly negotiate more flexible arrangements for the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are bewildered by the accord's failure are the same people who may be enticed by the populist fantasies of the Left and the ACTU. The accord failed because it attempted to give a central focus to millions of employment decisions made in thousands of workplaces.  In other words, it sought to do the impossible, and the result has been stagnation, first in productivity and then in mass unemployment. Whatever made them think it would be otherwise? Employees and employers at the workplace level are the best judges of their own interests&mdash;not the Government, not the ACTU.  How could the ACTU and the Government time and again thrash out a centralised deal on wages, with scant regard for flexibility in the workplace level and the individual requirements for productivity at the workplace level, and expect anything other than low productivity growth and eventual stagnation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still this Government has not learnt its lesson. It talks vaguely about broadening the scope of section 115 agreements without realising that the very system itself is fundamentally flawed. It is ludicrous for a firm that has already reached agreement with its employees to then have to front up to the Industrial Relations Commission to gain approval by passing a public interest test.  The public interest will best be served by an environment in which employers and employees are encouraged to be flexible, to take control of their own situation and to act so as to ensure mutual survival.  The Government will not create such an environment by taking decisions out of the hands of employers and employees and making their decisions for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Panizza says, the stevedoring industry is just one example of that.  It is surprising, however, that more people have not looked to the accord as a partial explanation for this.  Under accord arrangements, there has been little or no incentive for employers to negotiate with or even just get to know their employees. This is because they have not had to arrive at their own outcomes on wages and conditions; these have been dictated to them under the accord.  Why bother to establish good relations with your employees when all the fundamental decisions concerning their wages and conditions are made outside the workplace anyway?  Management practices have stagnated for much the same reason that labour productivity has: lack of incentive to excel at the personal or workplace level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of these considerations, it is interesting to review the comments by the Industrial Relations Commission in its April national wage case that the industrial relations system in Australia was not mature enough to move to a system of enterprise bargaining.  It puts one in mind of the old problem of infant industries.  Management and workers will never grow up as long as they are cosseted by a centralised wage fixing structure.  The result is a system that may protect many who have jobs but delivers low productivity outcomes and marginalises an increasing number of people who are unable to find work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This problem will not be resolved by seeking greater flexibility within a centralised system. As the Industrial Relations Commission demonstrated in April, this is a contradiction in terms. A quantum leap is required, a genuine devolution of power and responsibility. Only when workplaces are genuinely responsible for their outcomes on wages and conditions will productivity rise to the extent that it must to create more jobs and greater prosperity for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important factor that is often overlooked is the fact that employers at the workplace level have no control over their wages bill. That is another area where Labor's accord has had a detrimental effect on management practices. Again, it is only if we get away from the centralised wage fixing system that employers will be able to take that responsibility. The legacy of Labor's management of industrial relations and its employment structure is a system that has stagnated, a system that lacks the flexibility to cope with our current economic woes, let alone the dynamism and forward thinking that is required as we move into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the system is fundamentally reformed, in fact overturned, Australians will continue to suffer social dislocation and one million stories of hardship and poverty will continue and, indeed, be added to. The message is overwhelmingly clear:  creating an economy that is capable of providing jobs requires that Labor's accord must go and must be replaced by the industrial relations proposals of the coalition. That is why I support the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill), particularly as it refers to labour market reform. </PARA>

Increased sales cannot continue if the discretionary income is down. The statement contains phrases such as, `We are carefully watching economic developments'&mdash;like a goldfish in a bowl.

If the Government is going to do something, why not have a very fast train or some project with some capacity in it to take us into the next century and make a difference?  The CSIRO is to get $10m.

I do not believe that; I think one has to make an economy go by getting rid of the impediments to success. The Labor Party believes it can buy jobs, yet it has put up only $162m for this grand scheme&mdash;a measly sum.

As a senator, I have never had as many people writing to me as I have in the past 12 months. Almost every day I receive letters from unemployed people asking me to help them in some way or another to get a job. The Labor Party must also be experiencing this because I pulled out some figures on unemployment in the electorates of the Federal Cabinet Ministers. There is an 18.8 per cent unemployment figure in Footscray, which is in the electorate of the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis. In the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, it is 15.8 per cent. In Brunswick, in the Prime Minister's electorate, it is 12.1 per cent. In Dandenong, which is in the electorate of the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, the figure is 15.1 per cent. Government Ministers must come face to face with this.

We had Marandoo where we had the chance to get some industry going. What happened? We have Yakabindie where now we have the third challenge by the Aboriginal heritage group funded through ATSIC by this Government. The Government is spending money to wreck private enterprise's efforts to get industry off the ground. We have the Moora pulp mill and the sly remark from Senator Cook from a question this afternoon. We have had the unions trying to wreck that one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have Kambalda where the Deputy Premier of Western Australia has sided with the unions to stop a new mine going ahead.

They have all gone out on strike and put Kambalda out of action today. The Deputy Premier of Western Australia, Ian Taylor, who represents the seat of Kalgoorlie, the centre of goldmining in Australia, is siding with the miners who are on strike even though they have been offered an extra $263 a week.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Budget was drawn up, the immediate risk that private calls on national savings would grow faster than public calls were falling has lessened. This lessening is attributable to two main factors:</PARA>

He spent 24 years with the ACTU trying to wreck the businesses and industries of Australia, while a well-led Liberal Government led us through the best period Australia has ever had. He has had nearly nine years of leading from inside and has wrecked Australia by allowing record taxation&mdash;new taxes and increased taxes&mdash;and outdated work practices to grip Australia.

They should be brief because it does not deserve much of the Senate's time for consideration. My view is that I captured the Government's feeling about this statement when Senator John Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, sat down. There was not a single `Hear, hear!', or cheer; it was just a damp squib. Most of the honourable senators on the other side of this chamber were probably highly embarrassed by this appalling, lacklustre statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have had 18 economic statements from this Prime Minister, and he was down to his last three matches this year. He lit his first match on 12 March, and that went out. He lit another match in the Budget, and that went out. Today he had his last match, the last hope for all these freezing cold people wanting a bit of hot water, and that match just blew out.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of hope and despair that the unemployed people in Australia&mdash;and, indeed, everyone in Australia&mdash;will feel because of this statement. </PARA>

What it really is is a compromise statement. It is a statement that has been compromised by Paul Keating. It is a statement that has been compromised by the ACTU. It is a statement that has been compromised by the ALP's own policies. It is a statement that has been compromised by the green movement. It is a statement that has been compromised by Aboriginal activists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Government in the Senate, in his conclusions, says that the course is clear as to where this Government must go and that it will maintain its resolve. He says that we must keep inflation down, but nowhere in the statement does it point to how inflation will be kept down. There has not been one single structural change that would have us believe that inflation can be kept down. It is only down because there is a massive recession, if not depression, keeping it down which has dampened down all demand in this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> He has talked about maintaining investment. But some very simple figures in the very important area of investment expenditure in Australia show that, back in 1987-88, $622m was spent on resource development exploration expenditure; in 1989 it was down to $514m; in 1990, $392m; and in the last 12 months, $361m was spent on exploration. Of course, on these investment figures&mdash;and we know by the very admission of Senator John Button, the Leader of the Government, in response to a question I asked him recently about Australia's capital crisis&mdash;we have the banks in a position where they cannot lend money because they have a $30 billion to $50 billion debt hangover from the last three years. We have prospectus provisions that make it almost impossible or too expensive to raise money through a flotation on the share market and, of course, we have a stupid business tax regime that this Government talks about reforming but does nothing about. Where will the investment come from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also environmental restraints. Senator Button refers to the fact that he will maintain the strictest environmental standards in the world, and in today's issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Mining Review</EMPHASIS> the research officer at the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia refers to the greenhouse research and the fact that all the Government's policies in relation to meeting the Toronto targets will probably involve wiping out the entire coal mining industry. It will create negative growth and lost employment. It will fundamentally ensure that, because of the green commitments made by Senator Richardson to get this Government re-elected at the last election, we will have negative growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we talk again about fast-tracking projects. I asked Senator Button in the Senate only a few weeks ago what had happened to the committee that was set up as a result of the March 12 statement to fast-track projects. Senator Button was not even able to tell the Senate whether that committee had met. Suddenly, here we are six months later in a situation where there are no more projects; projects are being wiped across the country. There is no hope, only despair. </PARA>

The expectation that that would be announced in this statement was very high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Senator Button read that statement, he immediately turned on his heel and walked out of the chamber, and I do not blame him. The lack of morale amongst Government senators was staggering. They had not heard the statement before, and as they sat there and watched and listened to what was being said, they knew what the headlines would be tomorrow. The journalists had already said that they did not expect the statement to be any more than just rhetoric, and that is exactly what we got. On the first page of that statement, Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say to this House what the Prime Minister has said repeatedly outside: he has not spent the whole of his 33 years in public life in the Labor movement of Australia to acquiesce in allowing the present high levels of unemployment to continue.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has caused those high levels of unemployment. He, along with the previous Treasurer, deliberately created one million unemployed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister was the leader of the ACTU, he indulged in these extra work practices about which overseas people shake their heads and say, `How do you ever expect to regain any competitiveness?' It costs more to send a car from Melbourne to Hobart, or across Bass Strait to Launceston, than it does to send the same car from Sydney to Japan. We will never be competitive while we have a past President of the ACTU as the leader of this country. His whole mentality is geared towards the employment angle and the highest wages he can get, the best working conditions he can get, and to heck with the unemployed. The ACTU has never shown any interest in the unemployed. Indeed, before a Senate committee on superannuation Bill Kelty said, `The unemployed are not our problem'. That is the mentality of the leader of this country because he also was a leader of the ACTU. The mentality of the leader of those opposite is that the unemployed are not his problem. </PARA>

He has refused to go down the line of assistance in the short term and he has refused to go down the line of complete tax reform through a goods and services tax, which is the long term method of overcoming unemployment.I remind the Senate that the answer the Prime Minister gave in the Budget was his better cities program&mdash;this mad cities fantasy. That is all he can think of. With a million people unemployed, is it any wonder that Dr Hewson says that all that will create is better pavements for people to stand on in dole queues. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the statement on page 8 attracted my particular attention. There is something not quite right in the figures that have been put forward. I refer to the AIDC and to this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) has recorded a profit of $9.6 million for 1990-91. The Corporation has asked to retain this profit as additional capital to help meet the demand for equity in new project development. We recognise that additional capital is needed, particularly for new investments in resource processing. The Government has therefore agreed that the profit should be retained by the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem with this is that in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> there was an article dealing very briefly with the surprise announcement that Mr Arthur O'Sullivan is to retire immediately from the board and his position as Managing Director&mdash;as of yesterday. Furthermore, because of heavy provisioning against bad property loans, the AIDC has a net loss of $8.8m for the year to 30 June 1991. I presume that loss is suffered by AIDC Ltd, which is the operating company of AIDC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises many important questions. How is it that the AIDC has made a profit of $9.6m, which it is allowed to retain, and, according to the statement, is going to invest in some way, whereas the press release that has been put out is couched in different terms and seems to have a different aim? At the same time, the operating company, where there is a 20 per cent private shareholding, has made a loss. How is it that the private sector bears the loss of the operating of the AIDC group and yet we get this statement that it made a $9.6m profit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those questions deserve answering and they deserve answering right away, particularly as the Government has said that it will continue to extend the Commonwealth guarantee to the Corporation's liabilities until 1998, which will thereupon underwrite its future borrowings to that date and will take away the test that was predicated by Peter Freeman in his editorial yesterday, which said that the ability to raise funds would be quite dramatically affected if that guarantee ceased, as it was meant to, in 1994. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the particular areas addressed are clearly the correct ones. Labour market programs, education and training programs, transport infrastructure and industry development are the key areas which should be boosted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However the measures are purely token. Actual jobs will be created by the road, rail and scientific infrastructure measures&mdash;these total only $112 million over the calendar year 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the measures have merit, they will create only a few thousand jobs. Indeed the measures are so ineffectual that the Minister has not even estimated the employment effects of today's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training and educational measures, which provide additional opportunities for Australians are worthwhile and are supported but there must be jobs for the participants to go to after the training is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Statement provided an historic opportunity for the Government to reject the free market approach and to unveil the vision and the plan that would help to get the country back on its feet again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not one industry plan, not one import replacement strategy NOT ONE. Just some embroidery around the current disastrous policies. The Minister has referred glowingly to the recent Caucus report on unemployment produced by Mr Harry Woods&mdash;unfortunately the key recommendations of that report have been completely ignored by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no mention of lowering the exchange rate to boost competitiveness, and there is no creation of a national development fund. Instead we have the completely token gesture of allowing the Australian Industry Development Corporation to retain its after tax profit of $9.6 million instead of paying most of it into Consolidated Revenue. Quite frankly this is a joke because the Industry Development Fund proposal involves hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars being put to productive use not a token amount of under $10 million.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give effect to the announcements in the March Industry Statement that the tax concession for research and development will be retained as a permanent feature and that provision be made for the deductibility of environmental impact study expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will exempt from tax the pay and allowances of members of the Australian Defence Forces allotted for duty in Iraq and Kuwait in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also contains amendments to support the existing tax file number arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment will give effect to the Treasurer's announcement on 13 June to provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company tax in respect of the 1990-91 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also give effect to the announcement on 2 August that living-away-from-home allowances paid to offshore oil and gas rig workers will be treated as fringe benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other announcements to be given effect by this Bill relate to foreign source income measures, gifts to funds administered by cultural organisations, deductibility of Petroleum Resource Rent Tax payments and Medicare levy exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will also give effect to certain changes announced in the 1991-92 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One Budget announcement is an amendment to include the winnings of certain investment related lotteries in the assessable income of the winner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another will accord friendly societies and other registered organisations the same treatment for dividend imputation purposes as mutual life companies and government insurance offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Budget announcements to be given effect by this Bill relate to general mining exploration and prospecting expenditure, the timing of franking credits, capital gains tax and protection levy payments by life insurance companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the capital gains and loss provisions in the tax laws to address community concerns by allowing shareholders in companies in liquidation to realise capital losses on valueless shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces new procedures to be followed by taxpayers seeking review by the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also simplifies the law by consolidating objection, review and appeal provisions that are common to various taxation laws administered by the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the garnishee rules and PAYE provisions of the tax laws as well as propose several minor changes to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill contains a number of minor technical or consequential amendments of the tax laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Environmental Impact Study Expenditure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will allow a deduction for expenditure incurred on or after 12 March 1991 on environmental impact studies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expenditure, other than for plant and articles, will be written off over the lesser of 10 years or the life of the project to which the studies relate.The cost of plant and articles will be depreciable.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed deduction was announced by the Government in the March 1991 Industry Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of this measure is expected to rise to an estimated cost of $45 million after 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exemption of pay and allowances of members of Defence Forces serving in Iraq and Kuwait</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced by the Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel on 14 August 1990, the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force personnel allotted for duty in Iraq and Kuwait in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will be exempt from income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed by this Bill will extend the existing operational area for the exemption to include the countries of Iraq and Kuwait with effect from 23 February 1991. The amendment will also cease the exemption after 9 June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revenue cost was in the order of $8.75 million in the 1990-91 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital Gains Tax Cost Base</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will implement the change announced in the 1991-92 Budget to the capital gains tax provisions. Taxpayers will now be allowed to offset non-deductible costs such as interest, repairs, rates and taxes and insurance premiums against the taxable capital gain made on disposal of an asset. The change affects assets acquired on or after 21 August 1991 and is not expected to have a significant revenue cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital Gains Tax and Valueless Shares</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to the capital gains and losses provisions addresses community concerns that shareholders in companies in liquidation are unable to realise capital losses on valueless shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will remember that in an earlier Second Reading debate on a private member's Bill dealing with this issue, it was indicated that the Government was looking at possible measures to deal with the problem faced by these shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We felt that the amendment proposed by Senator Watson was not the most appropriate answer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed by this Bill will apply where a taxpayer owns shares in a company in liquidation and the liquidator has indicated that there is no likelihood of shareholders receiving a distribution in the course of winding up the company. It is considered that the  liquidator would be in the best position to accurately determine the financial position of the company concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, if the taxpayer makes an election, the taxpayer will be taken to have disposed of (and immediately re-acquired) the shares for no consideration at the time the liquidator's statement was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will overcome the particular problem facing holders of shares in companies which are in liquidation; due to the operation of the Corporations law these shareholders are prevented from transferring their valueless shares and realising a capital loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In circumstances where it is still possible to transfer ownership of a share, for example if a receiver has been appointed to manage the affairs of a company, this problem will not arise. Therefore the application of the amendment is restricted to apply only to the shares of companies which are in liquidation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment will apply to eligible shares from 11 November 1991, regardless of the date that the liquidation of the company commenced. However the statement by the liquidator and the taxpayer's election must be made after that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Research and Development</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax concession for research and development at the rate of 125% of expenditure incurred will be retained as a permanent feature of the Income Tax Assessment Act beyond 1995. The Government has decided to retain the concession in order to keep promoting research and development activities by industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision which was announced in the March Industry Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost is $180m per annum in the first year of impact 1996/97 rising to $280m per annum by the year 2000/01.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Direct lodgment of taxation appeals and applications for review</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present law a taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner on an objection against an assessment or similar decision may request the Commissioner to refer the decision to the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This right of appeal or review is given to taxpayers by various taxation laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following an independent review of the processes for resolving taxation disputes, a recommendation was made to the Government that taxpayers should&mdash;like litigants in fields other than taxation&mdash;lodge their own appeals and applications for review direct with the Court or the Tribunal. The Government has accepted this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, this Bill proposes amendments of provisions in various taxation laws to remove the requirement that appeals and applications for review be lodged through the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes have also provided an opportunity to simplify the law by consolidating the common objection, review and appeal provisions of the different statutes in the Taxation Administration Act. The new provisions adopt more modern language and drafting approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing provisions of that Act which modify procedures in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for taxation matters have been rewritten to take account of the new method for seeking review. Their effect is unchanged except in two minor respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One is that many documents formerly supplied by the Commissioner to the Tribunal as a matter of course will only be supplied if the Tribunal calls for them. This will save a lot of unnecessary time and expense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other change relates to the review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions of a Training Advisory Body to issue a training advisory certificate under the Training Guarantee legislation. They are not decisions of the Commissioner, and in future, review by the Tribunal of such decisions will not be subject to the procedural modifications I have referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will apply to all taxation decisions made on or after a date to be fixed by proclamation. Transitional provisions will ensure that the amendments also apply to appeals or applications for review made after the commencement date even though the relevant assessment was made before that date. This means that appeals or applications for review in respect of any objection decision made after the proclaimed commencement date will need to be lodged direct with the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax File Number</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the income tax law to provide for the assessment and collection of a tax file number withholding tax where an investor has not quoted a tax file number for certain deferred interest investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A separate Bill, the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991, will impose the tax file number withholding tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements, which will not impact on the revenue, will provide that, where a tax file number is not quoted by the investor for certain deferred interest investments, a tax file number withholding tax will be payable jointly and severally by the investor and the investment body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investment bodies which pay the tax file number withholding tax for a deferred interest investment will be able to recover the amount paid from the investor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of industry consultations, the Government has decided that the new rules will only apply to investments made on or after 1 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will give investment bodies sufficient time to make any necessary changes to their existing practices to give effect to these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Investment-related Lottery Winnings</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The winnings of certain investment-related lotteries which are drawn or decided on or after the day on which this Bill receives Royal Assent will be treated as assessable income of the winner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The winnings will not be taxed by this amendment if either the prize won or the right to participate in the investment-related lottery is already liable to tax under existing rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prizes will be taxed only if the lottery is in the nature of a return on an investment. Prizes won in ordinary lotteries such as Lotto are not affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal was announced in the 1991-92 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment has no direct impact on revenue, but will prevent revenue losses by ensuring that otherwise taxable investment receipts such as interest cannot be replaced by non-taxable lottery winnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Registered organisations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will accord friendly societies and other registered organisations the same treatment for dividend imputation purposes as mutual life companies and government insurance offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A company's tax liability gives rise to franking credits which can be used to frank dividends paid to shareholders. Registered organisations, like mutual life assurance companies and government insurance offices, do not have shareholders and therefore cannot use the franking credits that accrue from the tax paid on their insurance and superannuation business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will give effect to the 1991-92 Budget announcement to deny registered organisations the right to maintain a franking account and to cancel any surplus of franking credits held by them at 3.00pm on 20 August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure will have no direct impact on the revenue. However, there are potential revenue savings, in that it will prevent new shareholders of any friendly society that issues share capital, from having access to franking credits accumulated before capitalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Timing of franking credits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give effect to the announcement in the 1991-92 Budget to change the basis on which companies receive franking credits under the dividend imputation arrangements. The effect of the measure will be that only the payment of company tax will give rise to a franking credit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present law allows companies to pay franked dividends on the basis of imputation credits that are generated when a notice of assessment is served rather than when the assessment is paid. Shareholders are presently entitled to a franking rebate on the franked dividends received, even if the company tax liability that allowed the company to frank the dividends is never paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed by this Bill will apply to assessment and other notices increasing tax liability which issue after 20 August 1991. Appropriate transitional measures will cover cases where tax has been paid prior to issue of such notices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changing the source of imputation credits from assessment  to a payment basis will eliminate the scope for compounding the revenue losses that occur under the present law when companies fail to pay their tax liabilities. These revenue gains, however, cannot be quantified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Deferral of initial payment of company tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide the legislation necessary to give effect to the Treasurer's<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>announcement of 13 June to provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company income tax in respect of the 1990-91 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The companies affected are those with a tax liability of $1,000 or more but less than $400,000 and which pay their tax in two instalments. The date for the initial payment of tax was deferred by 7 weeks from the 28th day of the month following balance date to the 15th day of the third month following balance date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of initial tax payment affects the amount of a company's franking deficit tax and  franking credits and debits. The amendments, which will not affect the revenue, will ensure that those amounts will be determined as if there had been no deferral of the initial tax payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign Source Income</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has always been willing to fine tune the foreign source income measures to ensure their smoother operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, three of the amendments proposed by this Bill will operate to relieve double taxation that could arise under the measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first instance, further relief from double taxation will be provided in relation to an Australian controlled foreign company that has changed its residence from a low tax country to either Australia or a listed (comparable tax) country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, corporate unit trusts, public trading trusts and superannuation trusts will be treated similarly to other resident taxpayers, by being granted an exemption from Australian tax for distributions from a controlled foreign company out of income previously attributed to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment will ensure that taxpayers are not disadvantaged by the operation of the rules for the conversion and carry forward of foreign losses incurred before 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government is determined to act against attempts to erode the integrity of the foreign source income measures. Therefore, one amendment will deny taxpayers a tax advantage they have sought to obtain through changing the residence of a controlled foreign company from a comparable tax country to a low tax country. These taxpayers will be denied foreign tax credits on dividends paid by the company out of pre 1990-91 profits accumulated in the comparable tax country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fringe Benefits Tax&mdash;Living&mdash;Away-From-Home-Allowances</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 2 August 1991 the Government announced that living-away-from-home allowances paid to offshore oil and gas rig workers will be treated as fringe benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the fringe benefits tax law was introduced in 1986 it was the Government's intention that these allowances would be subject to fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to achieve that result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will have a negligible effect on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Gifts to Gift Funds of Cultural Organisations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give effect to the announcement of 24 March 1991 introducing new arrangements for gifts to gift funds of cultural organisations. The amendment will take effect from 25 March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new arrangements tax deductible gifts may be made to gift funds listed on a Register of Cultural Organisations. To be listed, a fund must be approved by the Treasurer and the Minister responsible for the Arts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of these new arrangements, the Bill will also remove the names of seven cultural organisations that are presently listed in the gift provisions of the income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the financial impact of the amendment cannot be quantified it is unlikely that the amendment will have a substantial impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Life Insurance Protection Levy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the income tax law to provide for the taxation treatment of various payments associated with the measure to assist policyholders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Limited and Regal Life Insurance Limited. For instance, protection levy payments will be tax deductible to life insurance companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal was announced in the 1991-92 Budget and the estimated cost of the amendments is $25 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General Mining Exploration and Prospecting Expenditure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mineral exploration and prospecting provision in the income tax law will be amended by this Bill. The requirement that general mineral exploration and prospecting expenditure needs to be incurred on a mining tenement to be eligible for a deduction will not apply on or after 1 July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change, which was announced in the 1991-92 Budget, will ensure that deductibility for such expenditure is the same as that which is available to petroleum and quarrying exploration expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is expected to be a small but unquantifiable impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Medicare Levy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill gives effect to the announcement on 9 July of the Government's intention to remove an anomaly which has arisen in the Medicare levy exemption arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will continue to guarantee that blind pensioners and sickness beneficiaries are exempt from paying the Medicare levy regardless of the level of their income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment avoids an additional unintended cost to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments Relating to Garnishee Notices</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the garnishee rules in the tax laws so that, in relation to building society shares, only withdrawable shares (and not permanent or fixed shares) in  the capital of a building society can be garnisheed from such a society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will provide for similar treatment for shares in companies and building societies in relation to the garnishee rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply to garnishee notices issued after the date of Royal Assent of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">PAYE amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) provisions in the income tax law. The amendment will restructure and update the definitions contained in the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The update will clarify the scope of the PAYE arrangements and remove existing references to arrangements between the Governor-General and the States. These references are no longer required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also correct a technical inconsistency between the definition of "employer" and the penalty provisions in the PAYE arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will not affect the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Occupational Superannuation Standards</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes that all payers of eligible termination payments be required to report such payments to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. This will remedy deficiencies in the current legislation whereby some payers are not required to report such payments because of inadequacies in the existing definition of payer.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority Act 1988. The amendments to this Act arise from changes to assistance for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries announced by the Government in the March Industry Statement this year. Reductions in protection will be accelerated by phasing tariffs down to a maximum of 25% by the year 2000, terminating quotas by March 1993 and abolishing bounties by June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The TCF industries will remain the most highly protected manufacturing sector but the March decision will bring them more into line with the rest of Australian industry. It will encourage the development of a more globally oriented TCF sector, while bringing benefits to the economy through the efficient use of resources and better products at cheaper prices for the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To help potentially competitive firms survive the pressure of protection cuts and to provide positive direction through this restructuring period, the Government decided to revise the TCF Industries Development Strategy (IDS) administered by the TCF Development Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to consolidate a number of the Authority's former programs into two stronger and more flexible programs, namely the Incentives for International Competitiveness Program which provides company specific assistance and the broader Infrastructure Support Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Incentives for International Competitiveness Program will provide assistance aimed at improving the competitiveness of TCF firms by extending assistance for capital re-equipment and rationalisation projects, investment in manufacturing systems and raw materials processing projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Act will broaden the eligibility criteria in relation to export orientation and import replacement so that more firms will be able to take advantage of the program. Firms will still be required to demonstrate increases in international competitiveness with projects such as those aimed at export growth, import replacement, quality improvement and cost reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important element of this strengthened program is the integration of the former Raw Materials Processing Program. The Authority will continue to place high priority on assisting firms to efficiently process a greater percentage of TCF raw materials, such as wool, cotton, hides and skins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Infrastructure Support Program is designed to provide assistance in areas such as research and development, skills and training, marketing and management services where such assistance is currently not provided under other Government programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised TCF Industries Development Strategy will now comprise four main programs</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the March Industry Statement commitment was made to the continued provision of up to $120 million through the IDS over the period until 30 June 1995. At the same time the decision was made to increase the annual allocation for the Incentives for International Competitiveness and Infrastructure Programs from $10 million to $15 million and to allow the Authority to roll over funds not spent in any one year to the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Programs will assist TCF firms to respond positively to greater import competition. As protection falls, firms will need to review their competitive strategies to focus less on price and more on design, quality and service. Firms may find it necessary to invest in new technologies and processes to be able to provide superior products and services. As a result the industry will require a better trained and more highly skilled workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised Industries Development Strategy will enable the Authority to help the TCF industries adapt to a new environment of relatively low protection. The challenge will be for firms to either succeed in export markets or to develop niche markets domestically. At the end of the decade, Australia can expect to have smaller but more dynamic TCF industries which will be viable with low levels of community support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority Act 1988 have no financial implications beyond those already announced as part of the Government's 12 March 1991 statement.</PARA>

The amendment to the Australian Overseas Telecommunications Corporations Act 1991 will ensure that a merger of wholly-owned subsidiaries of Telecom and OTC that occur as a consequence of the merger of Telecom and OTC will be exempt from tax and will have a tax neutral effect, as the Minister indicated. The intent of this amendment is to ensure that any subsidiaries of Telecom and OTC are treated in exactly the same way as Telecom and OTC.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section of the Bill deals with the certifications that are required for aircraft; that is, a certificate of airworthiness and maintenance release. The way the Bill is worded, in subsection (5) it states:</PARA>

<PARA>The point I made in my speech during the second reading debate was that, while the certificate of airworthiness would not necessarily be invalidated, a maintenance release does have an expiry point on it; either in terms of calendar months or in hours flown in the aircraft. It would be quite possible for someone to hire an aircraft, or have access to an aircraft&mdash;which would be beyond the control of the owner of the aircraft&mdash;and infringe the requirements of the maintenance release without the knowledge of the owner of the aircraft. In that circumstance, it is not reasonable to subject the owner to a penalty for something over which he has no control. I am led to believe, on a careful reading of the Bill, that it is not the Government's intention to have that interpretation put on the Act. It is quite a minor amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move to page 9 of the Bill dealing with the imposition of a statutory lien. I had proposed to move an amendment to that clause separating out the charges that were occasioned by the Authority operating in a commercial sense from those charges that arose out of its regulatory or licensing function. My basis for doing that was a reading of the parent Act where section 66, entitled `Charges for services and facilities', goes to the trouble of separating the two subsections. The provision refers to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)a charge for a service or facility provided by the Authority; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)a fee or other charge in respect of a matter specified in the regulations, being a matter in relation to which expenses are incurred by the Authority under this Act or the regulations, including, but without being limited to, a fee or other charge in respect of. . . </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)the grant or variation of an authorisation. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It seemed to me that by taking the proposed Government amendment we were granting the Authority the right of a statutory lien for its commercial activities. Clearly this is at variance with practice in the normal commercial world. My reason for proposing an amendment was to restrict the operation of a lien to what might be termed the true functions of the Authority, the regulatory and licensing functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that has been put to me against that is that it is valid to have all operations of the Authority covered by the statutory lien to recover debts to the Authority because the Authority cannot withhold its services; it has no facility to do so. That might be legally true, but it is not true in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principal functions of the Authority is to provide an air traffic control service. We have had examples in the past, and sadly we may well have them in the future, where air traffic controllers go on strike and the Authority cannot provide a service in that circumstance. If that argument is to hold, the Government has to think about putting a prohibition on strikes in the contracts of air traffic controllers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This relates to the question of wake vortices from aircraft. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that the CAA does have the power to investigate cases of damage to property caused by wake vortices and to make arrangements for compensation. It is a beneficial change to the legislation for people so affected. The CAA has a discretion as to whether it will pay compensation, or alternatively may make arrangements to repair the damage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment gives effect to a recommendation of the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, the HORSCAN Committee. HORSCAN recognised that there is little action people can take against government agencies such as the CAA or airline operators, and recommended that the Government meet the cost of repair in proven cases of damage from wake vortices. The Government accepted that recommendation. Damage to aircraft in flight has been excluded. I know I will not have to explain this to Senator MacGibbon as these incidents raise extremely complex issues of liability in terms of the actual cause.

It could well be that, for example, a claim for damage to roof tiling is made by a householder. Under this legislation the CAA would inspect the damage and the expert inspectors may determine that perhaps the tiles came off the roof because of their age, bad maintenance or whatever and were not damaged as a direct result of wake vortices from aircraft. In that case the discretion will lie with the CAA as to whether it agrees that there is a real case to be made for fixing the tiles. I might add that the CAA will be scrupulous in carrying this out as part of its operations. It may well decide that that is not the case; the discretion lies with it as to whether the people have a case. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I want to make that point is that, as I have said on previous occasions here, it was no mean feat to achieve that. It was in fact a significant step forward and AMSA deserves to be congratulated for making the successful representations that got international approval to declare this as a special area. I am sure that Senator Coulter would know, for commercial and all sorts of other reasons, that this is a proposition which is often stoutly resisted by other maritime nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments were made to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act earlier this year to introduce a compulsory pilotage regime for ships using the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef and Hydrographers Passage. These amendments provide that regulated ships must carry a pilot licence under Commonwealth, State or Territory law. Pilotage is presently carried out by pilots of the Queensland Coast and Torres Strait Pilot Service who are licensed by the Queensland Government under the Queensland Marine Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was considered inappropriate in an internationally sanctioned regime to have a system of pilotage relying totally on State law. In addition, industry has expressed concern regarding the monopoly position of this service and the allegedly high cost of pilotage. Amendments to the Navigation Act will enable regulations to be made to provide alternatives to the present pilotage arrangements and, in particular, to define who is qualified to be a pilot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pilot standards under Commonwealth law will be introduced only after extensive consultation with industry interests, including the present pilots, unions and national and international ship operators. Subject to the outcome of these consultations&mdash;and I have to stress that that is the one caveat I have to put on this&mdash;it is likely that the standards under Commonwealth legislation will include basic qualifications, that is, a master class 1 certificate of competency, medical and health standards, regular medical checks, experience in ship handling in a range of vessels, experience in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef itself and regular checks on performance. It might also be desirable to specify compliance with particular sets of operating procedures and standards. </PARA>

That would lead me to ask:  have there been changes under the recent amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, or whatever was amended recently? I might be a few years out of date, but  I thought there was indeed no monopoly, that anyone could provide a pilotage service provided he had the experience to hold a licence and could meet the infrastructure of being able to pick up ships all around Torres Strait or at the southern end. It used to be a fact that the pilotage fees were set by the Queensland Government, not by the Queensland Coast and Torres Strait Pilot Service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To answer the first part of Senator MacGibbon's question, no, this monopoly does not come about as part of any legislation or regulatory requirement that has actually been promulgated.  It comes about simply because this is the only way pilots can currently be registered under State law in Queensland. I cannot specifically answer Senator MacGibbon's question as to whether the fees are actually set by the State Government or by the pilot service, but really it is not particularly relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also add that there have been complaints. At this stage I would not be prepared to assert whether the complaints are justified, but complaints have been made and arrangements will be entered into which will provide for the registration of pilots so that this monopoly situation that currently occurs will not continue. In fact, this is a step in that direction. I do not think anybody would disagree that, in order to maintain a credible system of enforced protection of the reef, the pilots have to be properly registered and have recognised qualifications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that point, is it a fact&mdash;I think I refer to Senator MacGibbon's question&mdash;that some years ago a lot of pilotage was provided by the Department of Harbours and Marine, certainly for vessels coming in through Hydrographers Passage?  It is my understanding&mdash;the Minister might correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that some years ago the pilotage service was privatised. Bearing in mind that pilots are fairly scarce&mdash;it is not the sort of job, because of the qualifications required, where an advertisement is put in the paper and a pilot is picked up&mdash;many of those pilots then joined up with the Torres Strait pilot group. That is the position. There is certainly no legislation which entrenches a monopoly. Anyone who is available can come into that game.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 6, clauses 33 to 35, page 17, delete the clauses.</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to delete part 6. I believe this part has arisen because the parliamentary proceedings and the proceedings of the various committees of the Parliament attract privilege. When Parliament was broadcast by radio, those radio broadcasts, which were complete broadcasts of the proceedings, also attracted privilege. It seemed at first blush, when I looked at this the other day, that all that was happening here was an extension of that privilege to the televising of Parliament and the committees and various other procedures that go on in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On further reflection, one recognises that not all of the parliamentary proceedings are televised; they are televised only in part. There is a certain selectivity going on in relation to which parts are broadcast and which are not. While I make no reflection at all on the present telecasting of Parliament&mdash;I think the job that is being done in this place is absolutely excellent&mdash;it would be possible at some future time for some person with less professional ability or somebody using less care to select parts of the parliamentary proceedings and to telecast those in a selective way. If this part were passed in its present form, those broadcasts would attract privilege and no action could be taken against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that a potentially very dangerous situation is being created here. It may be, if later a television station were to begin broadcasting all the proceedings of the Parliament, as the radio broadcasts all the proceedings of the Parliament, that that situation would be overcome. In the meantime, it would seem that the deletion of this part of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill would be quite adequately covered by section 10 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a defence to an action for defamation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the way in which this sort of thing is likely to arise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the defamatory matter was published by the defendant without any adoption by the defendant of the substance of the matter, and the defamatory matter was contained in&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and these are the relevant words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a fair and accurate report of proceedings at a meeting of a House or a committee.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on. It seems to me that those words provide the necessary protection for those who would broadcast, but at the same time they leave the door ajar if some inaccurate or unfair broadcast were made and somebody were to take offence at that. For those reasons, it seems to me that it is premature to include a part such as this at a time when the whole of the Parliament is not being telecast, to extend the privilege to those parts which are broadcast, and perhaps selectively broadcast, and create a fault against which a person who has offended would have no possible cause of action. Accordingly, I have moved the amendment for the deletion of part 6 of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>This motion deals with three substantive amendments to the Telecommunications Act passed earlier this year. Two of these amendments are of a technical nature, while one makes a limited change to normal disallowance procedures for subordinate instruments. Might I say that there has been some extensive discussion between the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats on this issue. All parties have indicated that they understand the reason this has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first group of amendments relates to changes proposed to section 137 of the primary Act. This section was intended to give carriers the right both to interconnect their networks and to have their communications carried by other carriers. It was also intended to allow carriers flexibility in determining the means for such carriers. During recent negotiations between the bidders for the second carrier and Telecom Australia-OTC Ltd, it has become clear that there is a difficulty in the coverage of this provision in that it may not cover leased capacity or international services provided using carrier facilities that are outside Australia or a range of telecommunications services which carriers may quite legitimately need to provide to other carriers. The amendments to section 137 and associated consequential amendments address this difficulty by recasting the central concept of network and by recasting the underlying right to carriage in terms of a right to telecommunications services which now clarifies the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment to the primary Act is intended to close off a possible loophole in section 194 of the Act, which requires carriers to provide publicly available tariffs of the basic carriage services they supply to the public generally. The intention of this provision was that, whenever a carrier supplies a service to a person other than a carrier, the carrier should tariff it so as to give transparency to the provision of services and to assist in the enforcement of the discrimination provisions of the Act. The amendment to section 194 is simply intended to put this issue beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the two technical amendments. The third group of amendments inserts two new sections into the principal Act to modify the disallowance provisions under the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 for a limited period. A number of instruments under the primary Act, most notably carrier licence conditions, the ministerial determination of interconnect pricing principles under section 140 and regulations exempting carriers from State laws are crucial to both carriers. The sale of the second carrier and, consequently, the commencement of network competition in telecommunications is therefore dependent on the bidders having certainty about the regulatory regime in which they will be operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments are intended to allow the sale process to be completed by the end of this year by modifying the disallowance period under section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act as it applies to regulations and other disallowable instruments made under the primary Act from 15 days to five days, both for the period within which a disallowance motion may be moved and for the period of further consideration following a motion for disallowance. The provisions will also allow each House of Parliament, respectively, the ability to approve the relevant regulation or instrument earlier if it saw fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended operation of the Acts Interpretation Act is strictly quarantined to instruments tabled before 31 December this year. It provides for a sensible balance between allowing the Parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the relevant delegated legislation, which it can, while recognising that we do have a special set of circumstances which recognise commercial realities so as not to delay the commencement of competition in this vital industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we will accept each of these three amendments. With regard to the first amendment, we believe it is important that a carrier has the right to interconnect its facilities to the network of another carrier and that any doubt be removed, as it will be by the repeal of the originally proposed new section 137 and the substitution of this proposed new section.

I have a question in relation to carriers' rights to interconnect&mdash;the repeal of section 137; I am talking about page 7 of the amendments, (3)(a), parts (i) to (iii). I understand that Telecom asked for clarification of the effect this would have on it and that Mr Beazley responded. I ask the Minister: what is the effect of this particular section on Telecom?

For those commercial interests out there to essentially use the Parliament like a puppet on a string to suit their particular and immediate commercial interests, I think sets a very dangerous precedent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to that very briefly. I want to clarify the position absolutely. That is not the case at all.

I understand the Democrats' position on this and respect it. The Opposition and the Government have a different view on the matter. There is not one iota of pressure from any commercial interest. The Government is anxious to have this reform in place. We want to negotiate it successfully and we want to have it in place by the end of the year. Clearly, we do not consider this to be a practice that should be adopted as a matter of course. That is precisely why it is structured in the way it is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing to notice about these Bills is that they show no move on the part of the Government to draw back from the policy path that it has followed under the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and his compliant assistant, Mr Baldwin, which is the path of greater centralised control by Canberra. I say to the Government senators opposite and to the representatives of the Department who are present as advisers, that there has been no drawing back over recent months&mdash;indeed, over recent years&mdash;from greater centralised control by Canberra in all matters that relate to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let it be clear that with the election of the coalition to government that will end, and we will see an abrupt change in the arrogance that centralises power in education matters in Canberra. Great insight and ability to make decisions lie with the education institutions and beneficiaries of education, that is, families and students. On our election to government we will see an end to this increasing accretion of powers to the Minister and the bureaucracy in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills before us tonight again demonstrate this greater intrusion into the decision making of education institutions, and more bureaucratic requirements for the unnecessary provision of detailed information to the Department by those institutions. Many times in the past the Opposition has criticised the Government's whole approach to education policy. We shall go on doing so until members of the Australian public not only recognise this malaise, this problem, but also cry out&mdash;as they are already&mdash;for a change in education policy. This Government is impenetrable and such a change requires a change of government. We desperately need a change of government to achieve education reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills fail to show any change of heart on the Government's part. There is no new initiative and there is nothing creative in them. The Bills plod on with the inhibiting centralism of which the education industry at every level has now had a gutful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills are limited to continuing the Government's same old basic approach. This is particularly so in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991. There may be some benefits to be gained from setting up advanced engineering centres, running a pilot scheme where the Government and employers will jointly fund a few extra student places, and there is a faint attempt to begin to reward improved quality in higher education institutions, yet the overall provisions maintain the framework of the unified national system&mdash;the straitjacket that Mr Dawkins has placed on Australian higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see no response in these Bills by the Government to the views of the Industry Commission, for example. What has the Government ever said about the Industry Commission's report into education in this country? This is a commission appointed by this Government. The Industry Commission recently described the current approach to the regulation and funding of higher education as `fundamentally flawed'. I will repeat it: this Government's Industry Commission described this Government's approach to higher education as `fundamentally flawed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way to get education reform in this country is to see a change of government. The Opposition sees no sign of the Government being willing to take seriously other options for higher education policy such as the Industry Commission's detailed analysis and advocacy of flexibility.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For five years I have been commending the 15 years that I call the Karmel years in Australian education policy and decision making. They were years of rationalisation in which quite a deal of initiative was taken in Canberra. They were so successful that we do not need a period like that to be repeated ad infinitum, we need an ability for creativity to be given an open door in education institutions. This Government has taken the wrong cue from the 15 years of what I will call Karmel success. It wants more of the same&mdash;more rationalisation, more amalgamation of colleges and universities, and more centralisation in Canberra. For five years, at least, we have been going down the wrong path. I agree with the Industry Commission that higher education is fundamentally flawed in the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come to the&mdash;let me be honest&mdash;reluctant conclusion, even as an Opposition member, that the only way to get education reform into the thick heads of the Government's policy decision makers is to throw them out and bring in a completely new team.

I do not think there is any voice; there is not one person.

Who knows what is going to happen to these lone voice statements of Mr Dawkins about the Commonwealth's initiatives in TAFE? Who knows what is going to happen? There is nothing in this legislation. I say on behalf of the Australian people, at least in my State, who are using TAFE facilities: let this Government give some lead, because it is dismally failing TAFE in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a vacuum in this legislation. It is by no means clear what the exact final outcome will be from the negotiations between Federal and State governments concerning the future responsibility for the funding of TAFE. Mr Dawkins has, characteristically, gone into these negotiations bold and brave up front, but he does not represent anyone in Cabinet, except himself. He does not have the Prime Minister's support, and his mate Mr Keating is out in the cold, so we are none the wiser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressing need is for a substantial improvement in Australia's training effort, and it is not actually even what Mr Dawkins has said on his own behalf.

They do not want centralised bureaucratic control in Canberra for TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The only way forward for education reform, I say clearly to the Senate, is a change of Government. This Government has got to go and we have to see a new team.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I turn to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991. It offers no major break with past policy; it is the same old stuff. The old restrictions on schools continue. There are two small steps in the right direction. Firstly, there is funding for national projects to increase the number of students in country areas finishing year 12&mdash;a small, inadequate step in the right direction. Secondly, there is the school language and literacy program which was developed in the context of the White Paper on Australian language and literacy policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper is too slow, too late. It was 10 years ago that, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and the Arts, I had the honour to move in this Senate an inquiry into a national language policy. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall this major report which came before the Senate, and one of the Clerks at the table will remember that in another life he was secretary of that inquiry. It was a very important inquiry, and it was unanimous. No-one has criticised this report. It set out an approach to a national language policy for Australia. It was followed by the Joe Lo Bianco draft report for the Government response to this&mdash;an excellent response&mdash;and eventually by what is called a White Paper on language policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to language policy, I wish to add a reference to recommendation No. 87 on page 162 of the Senate Committee report to which I referred earlier. That recommendation reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee thus recommends that education authorities should identify those languages of major relevance to the majority of schools. Funds available for the teaching of languages should be directed mainly to such languages, although a substantial portion should also be reserved for other languages.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the Minister has not taken that as his cue for arrogating to himself in this legislation a power to determine unilaterally, centrally, in Canberra what languages will be learnt in all the schools and universities of Australia. That is not what we meant in the national language policy report of the Senate. We meant that there should be a sensibly determined list of languages&mdash;I have in mind 17 languages&mdash;in which the Commonwealth ensures that there are well developed teaching materials, so that there can be a choice in universities and in schools. Each institution that presents a course will be able to weigh what is best and appropriate for its own community and consult, in the case of schools with parents and students and in the case of universities with the students, to ensure that they are presenting what is most relevant and most valued by those who are going to receive those courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, so that I can be held to account, there are 11 languages that I recommended then, and still do, that schools should be fully equipped to make available: English; one Aboriginal language, and I suggest Pitjantjatjara; Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian&mdash;the three most important Asian languages; French, German and Spanish&mdash;the three most important international languages; Italian and Modern Greek&mdash;the two community languages with the greatest number of speakers in this country; and Latin, which is important for all of them. With regard to university education, all 11 languages must be available, plus the following six: Arabic, Russian, Hebrew, Classical Greek, Hindi and Korean. I mention Hindi and Korean because after the three I mentioned, they are the principal Asian languages that we ought to have some Australians with expertise in; I mention Old Testament Hebrew and Classical Greek because they are the languages of the foundations of our Western culture; and Arabic and Russian are also major world languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other languages of community importance in Australia and of importance to our economy and in many other ways.

But I will oppose a Minister in Canberra of any political persuasion determining what the choice of those 17 languages should be in any school or in any university. Let the universities themselves determine that; let the schools determine that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer briefly to the non-government schools policy of the present Government, which has been a total disaster. It is one of the blights on Australia that there has been a sop thrown to the left wing of the Labor movement by way of a virtual ban on new non-government schools in this country. I say `a virtual ban' because every kind of impediment has been placed in their way. It was attempted first under Minister Ryan and it has been fully put into place under Minister Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the statistics on the results. There was a 10 per cent rise in the number of schools in the five years from 1981 to 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>It was then that the new schools policy was announced. As a consequence of that disastrous policy, brought in by a Labor government as a sop to the left wing for ideological reasons, there was a one per cent increase in the five years after 1985. The left wing ideologues in the Labor Party are cheering about that, and the Australian public is totally shattered by the policies of this Government. I give the promise now, on behalf of the Opposition, that this will be completely changed by a coalition government. We will open the doors to make it possible, as it was before this policy was introduced, for responsible new non-government schools to be added to the offerings for Australian school children. </PARA>

Another 23 per cent at least want to attend non-government schools, and we will make it possible for them.

We are opening the door for them to be able to choose a non-government school that has an education policy that will realise the full potential of their children. The only way that will be achieved is by a change of government.

Additional funding is provided for several specific programs ranging from schools language and literacy, grants for advanced engineering centres at universities and the country areas program.

The  Australian Democrats support the view that autonomy, diversity and freedom of choice in training and education should be maintained but that planning on a national scale is required if resources are to be most effectively and efficiently used to achieve the objectives of education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this extent, the Commonwealth has a responsibility to coordinate the development of education and training in Australia, from school to postgraduate level, in consultation with the States on funding and policy measures, to ensure that both unity and diversity in the provision and delivery of education services is maintained.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats broadly support the measures outlined in this Bill and are particularly pleased to see the Government implement aspects of the school and language literacy program. The Australian Democrats believe that a second language should be accepted as an integral part of the learning of every Australian. Any measures designed to improve and enhance the teaching of second languages and of basic literacy in Australian schools must be commended. In 1990, only 11.68 per cent of Year 12 students studied a language other than English and this, as the White Paper points out, is a massive decline from the 40 per cent of students who studied a second language in 1967. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that of the 14 priority languages listed in the White Paper, six are Asian languages. In addition, Aboriginal languages are included. Particular attention must be given to ensuring that young Aboriginal people are encouraged to maintain and study their mother-tongue throughout school years. We must not ignore the long heritage of our indigenous people. The priority languages list reflects the concern of many in the community to ensure the long term survival of Aboriginal culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The geographical position in the South East Asian region means that efforts must be made to ensure that Asian languages are taught in schools at an early age so that in the long term we are more fully able to participate in the region economically, culturally and socially. The teaching of Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese not only indicates the increasing importance of the region to Australia but also reflects the impact of these communities on urban life in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in so doing, we should not ignore our European heritage&mdash;the classical languages, thinking and ideas that have shaped our institutions, laws and social fabric. To that extent, I would support Senator Teague's contention that Latin should be added to the list of 14 languages. However, I would not be so presumptuous as to presume that hieroglyphics should also be added. French, German, Italian, modern Greek, Russian, Spanish and Arabic have been accorded the status of priority languages. This is an indication of the rich multicultural mix of community languages that are widely spoken in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the provisions regarding language policy, the Bill also provides over $3.2m in funding for a national component to the country areas program. This measure is designed to enhance retention rates in rural areas of young people to Year 12. The Finn review indicated that `Year 12 completion rates remain about five percentage points lower in non-metropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas'. A recent report by the National Board of Education, Employment and Training cited figures of 59 per cent for metropolitan areas and 54 per cent for non-metropolitan areas. There is clearly a great deal of room for growth in retention rates in country regions, particularly in the remote parts of Australia. To this extent, we are very pleased to see the Government recognise its responsibility, although for many it is probably a case of too much, too little, too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be hoped that the additional funding for the country areas program will directly assist in increasing the completion rates for young Aboriginal people. According to the Finn review into post-secondary education, the retention rate of Aboriginal youth to Year 12 `is about half that of the national figure'. In 1988, 62.9 per cent of all students completed Year 12. If Finn's assessment is followed, this means that only about 30 per cent of all Aboriginal students are continuing their studies to this level. This appalling statistic must be addressed by Federal and State governments and by education service providers in rural areas if Aboriginal young people are going to have any chance of finding meaningful employment or increased mobility through post-secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1991, a Bill which seeks to implement Budget measures related to TAFE funding by providing for an increase of $1.66m in recurrent grants for 1991, approximately $158m for 1992 and maximum capital grants of $215m for next year. This latter figure represents a marginal increase of just over $3m on capital grants for 1991, a figure which falls far short of the additional funds needed to rapidly expand the TAFE sector in order to meet the goals set by the Finn review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of funding for TAFE is a thorny one. It has received a great deal of attention in recent weeks, following the release of the Finn review and subsequent debate. Currently, the Commonwealth funds 68 per cent of capital grants to the States for TAFE education, and provides only 9 per cent of recurrent funding. If the Finn review's target of having 95 per cent of all 19-year-olds in post-secondary education by the year 2001 is to be met, the Commonwealth will assume an enormous responsibility for funding additional places and capital growth. We are in fact talking about a 54 per cent increase in TAFE student places if the Finn review's recommendations are to be implemented. It will certainly require more than the 3.4 per cent increase in funding for TAFE, outlined in the Budget and presented to us in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth-State working party has put the funding needs for this TAFE expansion at somewhere in the vicinity of $5 billion over and above the Commonwealth's expectations for the next 10 years. The same report believes that as many as 200,000 students will miss out on TAFE places in 1992, which represents an enormous number of young people who will be unable to upgrade or obtain new skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that urgent attention should be given to this problem, especially for those unemployed young people who cannot get a job without obtaining more training. Additional funding must be targeted at the young unemployed so that they have some chance to improve their skills and, therefore, job prospects. It is soul destroying for so many to leave school only to find that there is no place for them at university or TAFE institutions and no job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally unacceptable that so many may be turned away from TAFE institutions next year and, to this extent, we urge the Government to look carefully at the funding proposals suggested by the working party. I</PARA>
<PARA>note that in today's statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a great deal of money&mdash;somewhere in the vicinity of $130m&mdash;has been injected into the system. This will, hopefully, go some way to funding an extra 50,000 places for students next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue of concern to the Democrats is that the funds needed to expand the TAFE sector may in future be drawn from students by way of up-front fees or HECS-style arrangements. The possibility of $1,000 a year course fees has already been raised by the New South Wales Minister for Further Education, Mr John Fahey. Students already pay an administration charge of $430 for diploma or associate diploma courses; $65 for one semester courses; and $130 for all other courses, including certificate courses. Exemptions are provided for pensioners and needy students. According to some reports, this has resulted in a 17 per cent decline in enrolments in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that the imposition of fees for TAFE&mdash;certainly in New South Wales this must be regarded as a distinct possibility, given the Federal coalition's policy of full up-front fees for higher education&mdash;would be a retrograde step for TAFE education. Clearly, if the imposition of a fee of less than $500 has resulted in a 17 per cent drop in enrolments in New South Wales, any move to impose larger fees will impact heavily on young unemployed people, particularly women and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The result will be an even more alienated youth, frozen out of TAFE and universities, unable to get a job and unable to afford training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will watch with interest the progression of discussions with the States, such that they are, on the issue of TAFE funding. Post-secondary education funding should not be counted as a cost but rather as an investment in Australia's future, an investment in the skills of our work force and in the future of our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1991 is, for the most part, supported by the Australian Democrats. We will, however, seek to remove from the Bill a clause which increases the de facto tertiary education fees payable by students. The main purpose of this Bill is to increase the amount of funding provided to tertiary institutions, both to finance further student intakes and to boost capital development. The Bill also provides for a wider definition of capital development to be adopted so that activities which effectively increase an institution's capacity, but do not involve actual building projects, will be eligible for capital works funding. Some works which were budgeted for 1994 will be brought forward to 1992, thus speeding up the expansion of our higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions of the Bill are very timely, even vitally necessary, for the viability of our education sector which suffers greatly from overcrowding and lack of resources. But will they be enough? The recent National Day of Action on Overcrowding brought to light many examples of intolerable conditions on our campuses, which detract from their efficiency as teaching institutions. As an example, the first year English courses at Adelaide University were so overenrolled at the beginning of this year that the faculty was forced to issue tickets to allow a limited number of students to attend lectures. At Macquarie University, students were actually locked out of lecture theatres because there was not enough room for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The condition of our halls of learning continues to deteriorate. The library at the University of Sydney is the largest academic library in Australia and contributes enormously to the ability of our scientists and other researchers to keep apace with the literature about developments in their specific fields. Many journals are so specialised that only a major institution has the resources to maintain subscriptions to a significant body of them. Yet the recurrent funding for this institution will be cut next year, because the university cannot afford to maintain its existing collection, let alone expand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the passing of the original Higher Education Funding Act in 1988, there have been four separate increases in the total allocation which is specified in section 17(3) of the principal Act. Each of these increases has been achieved by legislation. In counting the minor amendments passed in Act No. 138 of 1988, there have been five amending Acts passed on this legislation in three years and we are now debating the sixth. The total maximum grant in 1991, for instance, was originally specified as $2,288.299m&mdash;a rather large figure, I might add. This was increased in four stages to its present value. The Bill now before us seeks to increase the amount to approximately $2.7 billion&mdash;up 3.5 per cent from the Higher Education Amendment Bill earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this proliferation of funding legislation is good news for the press secretary of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who is thus enabled every six months or so to trot out a media release saying, `Government passes legislation to boost university funding', one wonders whether it would not have saved a lot of parliamentary time if the Minister had simply got the figures right in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher education contribution scheme fees are automatically indexed to inflation, and it is difficult to see why at least the predictable factors affecting allocations could not have been dealt with in a similar manner. Whilst this year's round of increases in this Bill are marginally ahead of inflation, the fact is that the number of students enrolled has been growing even faster than the number of Higher Education Funding Amendment Bills and there is still not enough money to go around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government needs to look at sources for increased funding to tertiary institutions, such as the industries which profit from the pool of highly skilled labour produced by universities and TAFE. The elimination of the unjustified tax lurks enjoyed by large corporations and the Labor Party's mates in big business would go a long way towards providing the necessary money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the corporate borrowers and speculators who brought the interest rates crisis upon us are apparently exempt from contributing to the real cost of education, students are not. Under this Labor Government we have seen the effective reintroduction of the student fees which were abolished by its more ethical predecessor, the Whitlam Government. Under the so-called higher education contribution scheme, which was introduced under the Higher Education Funding Bill in 1988, students are currently paying $1,993 per year of full time study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 12 of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill before us seeks to increase this fee by an amount that is $144 greater than the normal indexation increase&mdash;to $2,250. The Democrats consider this increase in the HECS fee to be unjustified. In the committee stage I will be moving that this clause be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this exception, the Democrats support the Bills before the Senate.

Although I do not oppose the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 Bill as a whole, I must point out to the Senate the glaring inadequacies of this Bill and the failure of this Labor Government to properly address the crisis that is facing higher education institutions in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government claims that these amendments, and the funding policies of the Government that they contain, will promote quality and diversity in the development of higher education throughout the 1990s. In fact, the proposed amendments invite exactly the opposite. They will only add to the bureaucratic administration of higher education in Australia and increasingly centralise funding to universities with government policy determining who gets the funds and for what reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will allow the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) to approve grants to higher education institutions for proving that they will use the grant to maintain or enhance the quality of higher education provided by the institution. Exactly on what basis are comparisons of quality of education between institutions to be made?  Do we look at the facilities available?  Do we judge on the basis of the courses available to students?  Do we attempt to compare the teaching philosophy and methods of practice?  It is preposterous to suggest that any rational comparison of quality can be made by looking at different universities' teaching methods or making any other comparison, as quality has so many facets that it simply cannot be measured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government in its proposal hopes to establish a national structure to determine exactly the criteria of sustained quality education. Where this has been tried overseas it has been a failure, because what is being attempted is not possible with any degree of validity or reliability. If the Minister has discretion to award these grants for quality performance, the result will be that the universities are going to be competing for desperately needed funds. The universities that win the grants will be those with better reputations. Thus, the rich will get richer&mdash;so much for equity. Obviously, the students in the other universities will just have to make do with poorer resource levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another flawed policy from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) which will serve only to stifle the innovative and pioneering work of which our universities are capable. Yet again, this Government is centralising further our system of higher education. How are our universities meant to become autonomous and develop a diversity of knowledge throughout this country if the purse strings are constantly held by the Government?  Under this scheme, money is wasted on an irrelevant national bureaucracy to administer yet another program when approximately 29,000 young people in this country are turned away from universities every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious alternative to this centralised bureaucracy is for the universities themselves to decide how to spend the money that is allocated to them. Only by having autonomy will Australia's universities be able to maintain and expand an internationally competitive higher education system with world class standards. I concur with Dr Kemp when he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policies encourage competition for bureaucratic favours rather than healthy competition in the educational marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA>This opinion is corroborated by comments of Professor Hill of the University of Wollongong, to which I will return later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for extra financial assistance of approximately $31m over three years for additional Australian Research Council grants. Once again, the Government is preventing the universities from flourishing by having strings attached to funding. Australian universities should not be centrally controlled. Educational processes can only be compromised by Government authorities when university funding is tied to meeting an ill-defined set of criteria set by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is widely observed that the Australian Research Council discourages university researchers rather than helping them. Earlier this year, Professor James Hill of the Mathematics Department of the University of Wollongong called on the Federal Government to review the operations of the ARC. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper he was reported as saying that serious researchers were wasting their time applying to the Council for funds rather than directing their activities to more productive research pursuits. Professor Hill stated:</PARA>

<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present arrangements encourage time wasting and inefficiency and have a resultant effect of detracting from research activity rather than assisting it.</PARA>
<PARA>When questioned on who was receiving grants from the ARC, the Professor said that in the present situation researchers were being funded either because they had a significant research reputation or because the thrust of their proposals happened to fall within the range of interests or priorities of a member of the relevant ARC subcommittee. He knew of several good research projects, led by distinguished researchers and involving research with obvious industrial, export and employment potential, which had failed to attract ARC funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To further show the inadequacies for the proposed reforms suggested in this Bill regarding grants, we can look at a study by the Department of Administrative, Higher and Adult Education studies at the University of New England. This study, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in July this year, found that many high quality research projects are not being funded. The report went on to say that the existing system supports safe science and stifles creativity and flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is clearly illustrated by the case of Professor John White of the Australian National University, and his work on the tremendously exciting and dynamic field of superconductivity. When a new discovery of carbon with superconductive qualities was announced, Professor White and his team from the ANU felt they should join the race to lead this field by drawing on their considerable expertise. They drew on their abilities, technical resources and the research students at the university to design this project. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that this expertise is Australian. It is a vital asset as this industry moves closer and closer to adopting superconductivity in production. This is an example of how the ability to be adaptable and flexible in our funding arrangements can keep Australia at the forefront of science and technology. If Professor White had applied to the ARC for the funds for this experiment through the ARC research grants system, he would be waiting still and Bell Laboratories of the United States would have the lead in technology, much to Australia's loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has created this situation by maintaining its policy of centralisation and not giving the universities the flexibility to act on problems as best suits their particular circumstances. Because the universities are so hemmed in by regulations from Canberra, they are also unable to act on the overcrowding problems that they face. Instead of giving the universities the chance to solve these problems, the Government in this Bill has practically ignored them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, it is claimed by the Government, addresses the problem of enrolment and overcrowding pressures in our higher education institutions by allocating just under $10m for additional student intakes next year. The people who are lucky enough to make it into a university are now subjected to the worst overcrowding of universities that this country has yet seen. The fact that the Government feels that it is adequately addressing this problem by allocating only $10m shows that it truly does not grasp the fundamental problems that our universities are experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allocation under this Bill of $3.5m for a pilot scheme with Government and employers sharing the costs of providing for the creation of 600 new student places in 1992 will be scant comfort for the 29,000 eligible applicants who were turned away from tertiary education in 1991. It is due to the incompetence of the Government, and the bureaucratic wastage of resources that it encourages, that these students are unable to fulfil their potential in tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is typical of this Government that it cannot see that the current economic recession, induced by failed former Treasurer, Paul Keating, is impacting on the critical problem of overcrowding in our universities. Young people are lining up to enter these institutions as an alternative to receiving unemployment benefits. The National Union of Students has voiced its concern at the current direction of Government policy regarding higher education. The President of the NUS, Ms Brigid Freeman, has been reported as saying that the Federal Government appeared to look at the problems of overenrolment at universities and high youth unemployment in `isolation' without recognising the possibility of a connection between the two issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also fails to recognise that it has established a political system for the distribution of resources. This system has very little capacity to respond to the demands of those seeking its services. A major cause of this inability to respond is the degree to which the bureaucracy in Canberra dictates restrictions to our higher education institutions through the education profile process. The executive director of the AVCC, Mr Frank Hambly, has strongly criticised this system, and the broken promises of reform, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is scope for much more government control over higher education than there was in the past. For example, through the educational profile process, the Government has considerable scope for telling institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake and how they should manage their affairs'.</PARA>
<PARA>An excellent example of the restrictive effects of the Government's policy is given through the Northern Rivers campus of the University of New England in Lismore. The stifling centralist policies of this Government are preventing this university from reaching its full income generating potential, thereby meeting the increasing educational demands that are being placed upon it. This institution is working hand in hand with industry to produce a more highly skilled work force. The university has created training programs, tailor-made for clients' needs, ranging from associate diploma to MBA and covering all of the clients' management levels. The revenue received from this innovative program meets approximately 15 per cent of the costs of Northern Rivers campus. The problem begins, however, because demand, which in this particular area is potentially enormous, is stifled due to pricing restrictions from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the most sensible arrangement would be to give the institution the power to negotiate on its own behalf and charge for its services as it sees fit. But a host of red tape from Canberra results in the inadequate development of alternative funding sources and, as a result, supply cannot meet demand. When these programs are up and running they provide a source of funds from which profits can be redirected to other areas so inadequately financed, thereby continuing to increase supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, this Government must come to the realisation that the ideological blinkers that it wears are only hurting the universities of this country. We urgently need to address the real problems facing higher education, and this can only happen in a more decentralised and autonomous university environment. The new provisions contained in this Bill, allowing more money for grants, will not be fully effective due to the operation of the Australian Research Council and the compromises that go with submissions to the Council. Strings-attached grants serve only to misallocate the desperately needed funds away from where the market actually requires it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money put aside in this Bill for additional student intake is far too little, too late. Unmet demand for tertiary studies will increase across the country, and will continue to do so until the Government adopts a more flexible pricing regime and allows institutions to set a range of charges for various courses. The Government needs to address the fundamental, underlying causes of the problems facing higher education. The Government has not yet recognised this, and the bandaid solutions such as those contained in this Bill will not resolve the problem in the long term. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Bill, I find it difficult to understand why Senator Sowada said that she would be supporting paragraph (d) of the Opposition's second reading amendment. The new national element of the country areas program, providing funds for national projects to increase the number of students in country areas completing 12 years of schooling, is a marvellous program. Indeed, when one looks at the way in which certain areas declared by the Commonwealth Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), on the basis of advice from State education Ministers, as being those which should receive funding under the country areas program, I think that the scheme that has been worked out is a very important contribution in trying to ensure that rural students, particularly those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, get a better chance to participate in the education system and to be retained in the education system. It will be of interest to Senator Sowada that this will also reduce the gender-oriented distortions that exist in the participation rates of, particularly, young women in country areas in some sectors of the curriculum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the priority of targeting schools in prescribed country areas serving students from low socioeconomic backgrounds should commend itself to the Democrats.

The fact that this Bill is being presented to the Senate raises a very real question mark over assertions that have been made that this Government has not seen technical and further education and vocational training as priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we see them as desperate priorities within the Australian educational system. We are very conscious of the fact that it is not good enough for Australia to be a clever country; it must also be a capable country. It is no use simply having intellectual endeavour. We must have the technologists, the skilled trades people who can implement those innovative, creative ideas, which might be those of other people or themselves, of course. We need to have the skills to be able to put ideas into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the lessons that Australia has had to learn. Sometimes those innovative and creative ideas do not get put in practice because of lack of entrepreneurial, daring skill on the part of those who profess to be interested in the market operation of the economy, but partly also because of a lack of those with the vocational and technical expertise to put some of these ideas into effect, or at least the lack of a sufficient pool of such people to enable manufacturing or other bases to be set up in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the current unmet demand of TAFE is some 150,000 places. That is totally unacceptable to this Government and to Australia. How we tackle those problems quite clearly will require national co-operative arrangements. I would remind Senator Teague that there can be no advance in the area of TAFE without co-operation and collaboration between the various levels of government, and that is what the education Ministers are embarked on now. Their discussions have been well publicised over recent weeks and are well known to all senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current funding arrangements are such that the States fund about 92 per cent of the recurrent costs in TAFE; the Commonwealth funds 8 per cent. The mere fact that this Bill for a real increase in Commonwealth funding of 5 per cent is now being debated in this chamber indicates the Government's priorities and intentions in regard to meeting that funding gap which prevents so many young Australians from getting the vocational technical training they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is backed up by the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today of a further sum of $115m for post-secondary education and training.  That will provide 40,000 students with opportunities to obtain vocational training. That is a very real commitment, indeed&mdash;one which I certainly applaud and one which I believe the Senate should also applaud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the need to secure a longer term secure funding basis for TAFE is a matter for Mr Dawkins, who is pursuing the matter now with State Ministers.  We have offered to take over funding responsibility for TAFE and I believe that whilst ongoing management and administration will be a matter for the States within national policy guidelines, the Commonwealth's offer to take over the funding responsibility is surely a most attractive one and one that is proper if we are to achieve our national goal of being not only a clever country, but also a capable country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) of 1991, the proper funding of our higher education sector has, of course, been a matter of long debate in the Australian community over the last several years. The very considerable funds allocated for the support of higher education&mdash;the almost 3,000 additional student intake that is provided for in 1994, the extra capital works additional funds, the millions devoted to maintaining the quality of higher education in Australia&mdash;are all matters which can be readily absorbed by those who are interested in reading, for example, the second reading speech of the Minister for Education (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps of more interest is the exploration being undertaken of the quality of higher education, and the Higher Education Council is being asked to undertake a very special role there. Once again, I believe that only following wider consultation with the higher education sector can a national structure independent of government be established to report on the application and effectiveness of quality enhancement measures developed by institutions, and in that context all those references to independence from government and measures developed by institutions are worth emphasising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been adverted to by Senator Tierney, balancing public accountability with institutional autonomy is difficult. One is very conscious of it, particularly in relation to universities. There will always be a question of whether the balance has been exactly struck, but we are very conscious of the need for that balance to be struck in a way which encourages institutions to make decisions which accord with national goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only matter of contention, really, as I understand the foreshadowed comments by the Democrats' spokesman, is in relation to the higher education contribution scheme increases. From next year the annual course contribution for a full time student undertaking a standard program of study will increase to $2,250, an increase of $144 above the normal indexation increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I think students recognise, their contribution is a part contribution to the education they receive from the various institutions in which they enrol. They also appreciate, I believe, that the increases that they are being asked to bear, either immediately or in a deferred way, will actually go to provide funds for the further expansion of the higher education system. I honestly believe that there is sufficient altruism within the Australian higher education student community to understand that they are making a contribution which, in fact, will provide more places and more opportunities for fellow students to obtain this sort of education. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That clause 12, page 5, lines 8 to 14, be omitted from the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Australian Democrats I rise to oppose clause 12 of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which seeks to increase the higher education contribution scheme charge from $1,993 effectively to $2,250. The Australian Democrats have consistently opposed the notion of user pays education and finds this measure particularly obnoxious. Clause 12 raises the HECS charge $144 above the normal indexation increase and, in addition, sets a new baseline for the calculation of the HECS liability. This represents a 13 per cent increase in the HECS charge, well in excess of inflation and far greater than most students expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, in effect, witnessing the introduction of fees by stealth. An increase of this magnitude next year will result in a single year HECS liability standing at $2,540 in 1993. In addition, I point out to the chamber that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has already printed a HECS handbook for students which details the new fee before the legislation increasing the charge has actually been passed by this Parliament. This is a great presumption on the part of the Government and the Minister, in particular, who might have had the good grace to wait until we had had an opportunity to pass these Bills. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not support the Australian Democrats' amendment. This decision to increase the HECS liability in regard to students contributing to the cost of their education is a Budget decision. There is no doubt that if we in the Opposition were to support the Australian Democrats in this matter we would suffer a compensating amount in the provision for higher education generally. With that clear predictable outcome in mind, we do not oppose what the Government has decided in the Budget and has announced in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the attention of the Committee of the Whole to the fact that there may be a minor drafting defect in the Democrats' amendment, in that it makes no mention of amending clause 2 to delete the reference in clause 2 to clause 12, which is a necessary consequential amendment. In other words, there is a reference to clause 12 in clause 2 which would be redundant if clause 12 were omitted from the Bill. That is only a tiny pedantic point. For the substantial reason to which I referred, the Opposition is not supporting the Democrats' amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. This is typical of the Democrats' woolly headed thinking on education that we have heard so often in this place. It reminds me of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who felt that he could make education free. The result of those disastrous policies for higher education in the 1970s was that the whole sector was grossly underfunded and students were turned away from universities. Those sorts of policies led to the situation that we have today of students not being able to get into higher education places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats should really consider why this Government has been forced in the past seven years to change from the Whitlam policies and to bring in, first, an administration charge and, more recently, fees at a low level and then increase them, as Senator Sowada has indicated, way above the inflation rate. The reason is that we are turning away 30,000 students each year from higher education. The only way people will get places in higher education is if we find alternative sources of funding. Students paying part of their fees is a way of obtaining funding. It is a just way of obtaining funding because the people who gain most of the benefit pay for that benefit. On that basis I oppose and the coalition opposes this amendment. </PARA>

I believe that, as I indicated, whilst it will be something of an additional burden for individual students, they realise that they are making only a part contribution to the costs of the education which they receive and, secondly, they also understand, as Senator Teague pointed out, that moneys raised from this particular levy will help expand educational opportunities for their fellow Australian students. That is also something which appeals to their altruism and enables them to bear this particular cost with some grace.

I will vote on this&mdash;it is not really an amendment; it is really opposing the clause&mdash;with the Australian Democrats because of one or two things she said. She pointed out pretty clearly that the increase is very substantially above the consumer price index. It came as a bit of a shock to me at all events that this was to be the case.

<TITLE>Funding of Independent Schools in ACT</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="3275" SPEAKER="Parer Sen W.R." NAMEID="KI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (10.43 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to draw this Parliament's attention to the absolutely disgraceful decision made by the ACT Follett Labor Government in recent weeks whereby funding from the ACT Budget to three independent schools has been withdrawn. Funding has not been withdrawn from categories other than categories one to three. The Follett Government's action is blatantly inequitable. It reeks of invective and favouritism; it is made, by the Government's own admission, on ideological grounds; and it flies in the face of an undertaking made in 1985 by the Federal Minister for Education. The then Minister, Senator Susan Ryan, gave an unqualified commitment that per capita grants would be maintained at their 1986 level in money terms until they reached the appropriate real level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deference to that commitment, which has been honoured by Federal and ACT governments in subsequent years, those schools have planned and budgeted. They have made long term financial commitments and incurred liabilities on the basis that the Government undertaking would be honoured. ACT Government funding is now to be withheld at the whim of a vocal anti-non-government school lobby that has muscled in on the present Labor Government. One can only assume that its silent agenda includes a caprice to adopt a policy already discarded and discredited in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union&mdash;that is, to herd the young students of Canberra into one amorphous, monolithic state-controlled education system, with no freedom of choice and little or no opportunity to strive for excellence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACT is the only State or Territory in Australia to allocate grants in direct proportion to the Commonwealth's categorisation. It is of great concern that while such doubt hangs over the fairness of this categorisation the three schools in question should be discriminated against. The schools in question are the Canberra Grammar School, which is category one, and the CCEGGS and AME, which are both category three. These schools will have their funding cut by some $520,000. That figure is of more than passing interest when one reflects on the cost of the ACT Government's recent decision to reopen two apparently redundant primary schools at a cost of close to $600,000 for a total of 125 children&mdash;a cost of $4,800 per pupil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the treatment of category one and category three schools, the proposal will reduce the ACT Government grant to AME and CCEGGS by over 20 per cent. It will reduce the ACT grant to Canberra Grammar by 50 per cent, which is $350,000 per year on current enrolments. In fact, it will make Canberra Grammar the lowest funded school in Australia by a very big margin. ACT Government recurrent grants for 1991 for category one and category three secondary schools stood at $585 per pupil. This will now reduce to $300 for category one schools and $460 for category three schools in 1992. Compare this with the $945 recurrent grants to category 10 secondary schools and the ACT government schools receiving $5,210 for years 7 to 10 and $5,800 for years 11 and 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, there is little doubt that the decision has been made to appease hardline elements opposed to government funding for non-government schools. It is an attack on a small number of schools perceived to be elite. That perception is ill founded and totally irrational. In fact, statistics prove that children at these schools come from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. In many cases, both parents are working; in the case of Canberra Grammar School, 82 per cent of current families have both parents working. Both parents, via the taxation system, contribute to the funding of government schools which their children do not attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the shadow Minister for education in the other place has said, the Federal Labor Government's new schools policy is a manifestation of its hostility towards the non-government sector. It is a policy that seeks to curb development and stymie the ability of parents to exercise their right to choose. In the five years to 1985, the number of private schools in Australia rose from 2,261 to 2,502, a rise of 10.6 per cent. The number of students rose from 687,996 to 775,336, a rise of 12.7 per cent. In that period&mdash;1981-85&mdash;the non-government sector's share of students rose from 23 per cent to 25.8 per cent. With the new schools policy in place over the five years between 1986 and 1990, the number of private schools increased by only 0.8 per cent, from 2,496 to 2,517. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can almost liken the ideological pursuit of Ms Follett and her Labor Government to the St Bartholomew massacre and the persecutions of Oliver Cromwell. Does Ms Follett model herself on Oliver Cromwell or the Medicis? Education is civilisation progressing. This ACT Government decision retards that progress. It is all about a perceived impression that those parents who wish to send their children to independent schools are rich and unworthy of a share of Commonwealth funding. The perception is just that. The 1986 census showed that 58 per cent of Australian Capital Territory families in the highest family income group sent their children to government schools. Many children whose parents have less income attend non-government schools. That is their priority and their right to choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not need to be Socrates to realise that the cost per pupil in a non-government school is much lower than the cost to taxpayers of state education. These proposed funding cuts could well lead to a move from the three schools back to the government school sector, and the ACT taxpayers and the taxpayers of Australia will have to foot the greatly increased bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party, at both Federal and State levels, speaks for fairness and equity. The withdrawal of funding to the three schools in question is thoroughly ill-founded and an unworthy decision. I only hope, having raised this issue tonight, that the ACT Assembly, led by the Labor Party, will reconsider its stance and, in consultation with those most affected, restore funding in line with the Federal Labor Government's former Senator Susan Ryan's commitment of 1985. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise only to support every word of the speech of my colleague, Senator Parer. It is a serious situation when, in the ACT, we see a hit list of three schools, such as former Senator Ryan envisaged back in 1984, now revisited upon her own Capital Territory. On the hit list that she had in 1984 there were 41 schools around the nation. She could not get away with it across the whole nation of Australia because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) intervened, but she and her colleagues who are still in the Labor Party in the ACT can get away with it because they appear to be in government in this Territory. It is an attack upon tall poppies; it is envy politics; it is an attack upon family choice; it is chopping down elites; it is a total sop to the ideological Left of the ALP; and it is totally rejected by every Opposition senator in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a few weeks, some 240,000 school leavers will find themselves looking for work or looking for further education. For most of them, the first choice would be to look for employment. But those 240,000 school leavers across this nation face a bleak prospect without employment because of the failure of this Government's economic policies. When we look at the task of creating a nation with prosperity, with opportunity, and with a prospect of a decent future for those young Australians, we must look with despair at the lack of opportunities which they have been given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, in passing only of course, to the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today. It is an interesting statement. The opening sentence is interesting and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia today is at a point of historic convergence.</PARA>
<PARA>By that, I assume he means Australia is between a rock and a hard place, because if one is a school leaver in this nation today there is very little opportunity to go and get a job; there is very little opportunity to find meaningful employment. The only sop that this Government can offer school leavers is more study in TAFEs and other places, which will not lead to meaningful employment at the end of that period but will merely take them off the unemployment queue, to lessen the public criticism of this Government's economic failing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have to look very closely at what this Government has done, because over and over it talks about a clever country; over and over it talks about a bright and rosy future. But what has it given us? The highest number of unemployed people in the history of this nation. What has it given us? The worst recession&mdash;depression&mdash;since the 1930s. What has it given us? A nation where industry and the farming sector have been devastated and where families bear the cruel burden that this so-called government of the workers, the so-called party of the workers, has bequeathed to them. The truth is that the people who sit on the opposite side of the chamber, the members of the Labor Party, are incapable of making the right economic decision, are incapable of getting any industry going in this country, and have been responsible year after year for the shedding of Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government talks about job creation. It could easily have created jobs by saying yes to Wesley Vale, by saying yes to Coronation Hill, by ensuring that Kambalda continued to flourish. But, no, the Government has refused to do so. Why? It is not out of concern for the workers but out of some twisted, almost moronic ideology that constrains it to deal with its ACTU mates and its Green supporters. We have the absurdity of this Government having a three-mine uranium policy, as though uranium from those three mines is somehow more pure or more sanctified than any other uranium that might be dug out of the ground in this nation. It was only a sop in the first place, but what it has done has cost this nation millions and millions of dollars in lost export earnings. That is what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Government that refuses to accept the fact that in the 1990s we need a change in industrial relations so that workers can take their own futures into their own hands. But this Government does not believe that ordinary workers have a right to determine how they will work, or for how much, or for whom. This Government believes that it and the ACTU can make a better decision for millions of Australian workers than they can themselves. That is not a particularly flattering view of the intellect of the Australian worker, but that is in effect what it is doing because this Government has repeatedly failed to implement a system of voluntary employment agreements that would return negotiations of working conditions to the place where those negotiations ought to take place, and that is the shop floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the Government likes negotiations tied up in its club of industrial relations specialists, the lawyers and the men in the suits, who do not understand what the workplace is like, who do not understand what industry is like and who, seemingly, do not understand that its so-called wage deals, its so-called accord, has just cost the jobs of thousands of thousands of Australian workers from one end of this country to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government tells us that the end is in sight, that the recovery is coming. Not only will Christmas beat the recovery, but in June I could have said that Christmas would beat the recovery and I still would have been right. It may be if this Government continues on its current track that Christmas 1992 will beat the recovery as well, because there is not one policy this Government can enunciate that will do anything about the decline in the competitiveness of Australian industry. There is not one policy it can put forward that will improve investment across Australia. There is not one policy it can put forward that will give to the workers a right to determine for themselves how, when and where they will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is why this Government has failed to meet the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of Australians. The Government has lost perspective; it fails to understand what motivates Australians. Australians are concerned with security for their families, with security of employment, and with the opportunity to do the best they can for themselves. This nation was not built on sweetheart deals in boardrooms, in ACTU meeting rooms or in industrial relation commissions. This nation was built on hard work, determination and perseverance, yet this is the same Government that wants to tax those who have determination and perseverance. It wants to tax those people who put the hard work in that generates the wealth that is important for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same Government that can look at a balance of payments deficit of $14 billion and congratulate itself on its economic success&mdash;absolutely incredible! If I went to my bank manager and said, `I've just run a loss this month of $10,000, but don't worry because it's right on target', he would be picking up the telephone and calling the men from the funny farm. That is what we ought to do with the Government because it does not understand that its economic policies are bleeding this nation dry at the rate of $14 billion a year. It congratulates itself for it. It fails to understand that that balance of payments deficit represents not only dollars that go overseas, but also jobs that go overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same Government that has been busy dismantling the tariffs around Australia. Ultimately, that is a good thing but what tariffs do not do&mdash;whilst encouraging overseas competition&mdash;is actually make Australia more competitive. The restrictive system of wage agreements that the Government has negotiated with its ACTU buddies is costing thousands and thousands of Australians their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure this Senate of one thing: that Christmas 1991 will be a bleak Christmas indeed, not only for the families of the 240,000 school leavers but also for the families of the one million unemployed in this nation and for the families of those who, though not unemployed, face the prospect of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the November 1991 Westpac <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Market Insights</EMPHASIS> publication predicts the possibility that the unemployment rate could go as high as 11 per cent. We have a prospect of rising unemployment and this Government tells us that the recovery has started! It defies logic to say that the recovery has already started when people are still losing their jobs. The only possibility of this country experiencing a recovery is if those opposite lose their jobs, and that is what they ought to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people are working in a business and do not perform, they lose their jobs. But it seems that this Government can fail to perform year after year, can destroy the aspirations of over one million Australian families and can spread this voodoo economics around the country and tell everybody that things are good. The fact is, things are not good and we know they are not. One of the Government's responses to the current situation has been this mad cities fantasy. The Government is going to spend $500m on its mad cities fantasy when the people really in need in this country are the people who live outside the capital cities, the people who live on the land, the people who live in towns dependent on people who live on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disturbing to note that this Federal Government and its State parliamentary colleagues in Queensland, faced with one of the worst droughts in Queensland's history, could find only $200 a family for the farm families affected by the drought. That is pathetic. It was a pathetic attempt by the Government to appear to do something when the reality was that it had no interest and no inclination to do anything at all. The Government can find $500m for its mad cities fantasy, but it cannot find the necessary money to ensure that there is decent drought relief, decent roads, decent hospitals and decent communication facilities for people outside the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of these reasons, as I said, the only way that this country will experience a recovery is if those opposite lose their jobs. I say on behalf of many millions of Australians, the sooner that happens, the better. </PARA>
