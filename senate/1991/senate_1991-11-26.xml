<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These matters are matters for Government policy which are continually under review. Let us look at the income tax rates which we inherited in government and the enormous changes which have been made under this Government during its period in office. I am surprised that this question comes from Senator Short, who is described by one learned commentator as `bogus' in what he has had to say about these issues. I am surprised indeed that it has come from Senator Short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a period of years this Government has made substantial changes to income tax levels in this country and, if it is appropriate, will do so in the future. Before the Opposition gets too excited, we should remember in the course of this debate that this country has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any country in the OECD. So do not get too excited about that particular issue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I take it, quite obviously, from the Minister's answer that the Government has no plans at all to lower the income tax burden on lower and middle income earners. I therefore ask the Minister whether the Government has any plans to compensate those income earners for the $22 billion of income tax paid to the Government through bracket creep since it came to office or for the threefold increase in the tax take from the Government's hidden consumption tax, namely, the wholesale sales tax, over the same period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short, who is in the package mentality which developed last week, has put a number of questions in his supplementary. He talks about lowering the tax burden on Australian taxpayers. Implicit in that is that the Opposition's so-called package does all of that. Professor John Head, who is an authority on this matter, says that the aggregate burden on workers, in relation to the Opposition's package, is not reduced by the tax mix switch.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on a point of order: I asked a very simple question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Both the original question, which he failed to answer, and the supplementary question were directed totally to the Government's policies. The Opposition's policies are out on the table and we will debate those with the Government any time it likes. But in Question Time today I am asking the Minister for answers about the Government's policies, not ours.</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable senator is very excited about this promise that one day&mdash;Sunday too far away&mdash;he might examine the question of payroll tax in this country. It is an enormously attractive promise&mdash;to examine the question of payroll tax at some distant time in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short asked me about payroll tax and then he went on to talk about compensation for bracket creep. Talking about compensation, over a period of time in the life of this Government we have introduced substantial income tax changes. There is always the possibility that we will do that again. We have been able to do that as a government because of the significant broadening of the tax base in this country, which those opposite never did. As a result, we have been able to deal with tax issues as they have come along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition comes in here today full of excitement. I can understand that because, after all, these issues were all available to members of the Opposition in the past but they did not deal with them. They did not deal with them, as Mr Downer&mdash;smart Alex&mdash;said in the House last week, `because we lacked the guts'. Now the Opposition is full of guts and noise, but the questions its members have to answer really relate to their brains and their policy prescription. If Opposition senators want to deal with that issue, we will happily deal with it.</PARA>

<QUESTION PAGE="3294" SPEAKER="West Sen S." NAMEID="1X4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. What is the Commonwealth's role in the problem of contamination of the Darling River by toxic blue-green algae?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3294" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware, as I am sure many honourable senators on this side are, that a massive outbreak of blue-green algae has appeared in the Darling River. The outbreak extends almost 1,000 kilometres from Wilcannia to Mungindi on the Queensland border&mdash;I am from Western Australia; it is not quite the same as being from Barcelona, but it is a long way from Mungindi.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the largest recorded blooms of such algae. I understand that algae blooms are not infrequent during periods of low river flow and are, therefore, in this case partly a side effect of the current drought. The bloom outbreak poses an immediate threat to the water supplies of Wilcannia, Louth, Bourke, Brewarrina, Walgett and Mungindi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales water and health authorities are devising strategies to minimise the growth and impact of the bloom, with particular regard to downstream water users and domestic water supplies. The New South Wales Department of Water Resources, in consultation with the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, is implementing a plan utilising the Menindee lakes system to reduce the risk of algae spreading to the waters of the lower Darling and the River Murray below the Darling junction. This should isolate the bloom to New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are health risks to humans and to stock in using this contaminated water. As yet, the New South Wales Government has not asked the Commonwealth for any assistance in dealing with the problem, although various Commonwealth authorities are in regular contact with their State counterparts. I can also say that there are newspaper reports suggesting that the Army could be brought in to cart water to affected areas. I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Defence that the assistance of the National Disaster Organisation has, up until now, not been sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has long recognised the significance of the freshwater algae problem and, in conjunction with the States, has engaged in important long term work through: the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, which is preparing a nutrients survey of the whole of the Murray-Darling basin; the Australian Water Resources Council, which is developing a national water quality strategy; and its funding of the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation, which is currently sponsoring some 15 research projects related to algae blooms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the moment the Commonwealth's role is essentially strategic. I am advised by the Minister that any requests for assistance from the New South Wales Government would receive prompt and efficient attention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not really have much to add to what I said before. Of course governments are concerned about high marginal rates. Every government would like to lower marginal rates; every government would like to lower taxes generally across a whole spectrum of activities. Every government would like to do that. It is only an opposition that can come in and do that by way of a con trick like this package which was announced last week&mdash;a curate's egg, if ever there was one.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given the Government's concern, to which the Minister has just referred, why has it allowed marginal tax rates on average earnings to increase from 30 per cent to 39 per cent since 1983, when it came into office? Why did the Government believe in 1985 that it was important to reduce marginal tax rates?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to a question here I am not going to go back to see what the Government was concerned about in 1985.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is absolutely not. I think it is important for all honourable senators to understand what this measure really means. It is important to understand what impairment levels are about, because it is pretty clear that those who have made the suggestion do not understand. The best way to explain the cruel nature of this suggested change&mdash;the absolute disgrace in regarding those with impairment levels of 70 per cent and under as being in some way malingerers&mdash;is to give some examples of what impairment levels are.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr President, I put to you that you should apply the same rule to the Government as you apply to us. Matters that go beyond the administration of Senator Richardson's Department are out of order.

I think the best way to explain it is to look at some examples of what these impairment levels entail. I will give just a few examples, but I would be very happy, if I were requested to do so, to give a whole lot more. A 70 per cent impairment level will very often involve paraplegia.

The trouble is that if we were to do this we would be talking about 300,000 medical reviews per year at a minimum cost of $100 a throw. We are talking about $30m. We are also talking about being able to get only a one or two per cent recovery rate out of forcing 300,000 of the lame and the sick to go back to medical reviews.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question appeals to me a little less than it does to the grandstand up there, for the reason that the events in Dili, appalling and abhorrent as they unquestionably were, were in our judgment, on all the available evidence so far, not a matter of deliberate or calculated government policy but rather represented some aberrant behaviour by a section of the military. I say `on all available evidence`; should there emerge contrary evidence, of course that judgment would need to be revised. But, as such, the situation is quite distinct from that, for example, which occurred in Tiananmen Square in China in 1989 which did reflect very deliberately a calculated act of government policy. As such, our concern has been to ensure that the event in question, in all its horror, is fully and properly investigated and that appropriate follow-up action is taken. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Again, there is no basis for any assumption at this stage that investigation will not be conducted on a proper basis and that appropriate follow-up action will not be taken.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, the Government has resisted taking action of any kind which would represent a significant downgrading in the bilateral relationship, whether it takes the form of minimising or deleting the very small amount of defence cooperation activity which occurs at a sum of just over $2m, or any form of trade sanction whether it relates to defence exports or anything else, or any form of cancellation of visits, or any form of reduction of aid, which is quite substantial. All those forms of bilateral response designed to express a formal protest are in our judgment quite inappropriate in the particular context that I have described. What is appropriate is some more constructive form of Government action of the kind that we will be debating later today. I do not want to spend time spelling that out. But it will involve diplomatic action, through a visit in the next few weeks to Indonesia by me, and other related activity. That is the appropriate response. There is simply no basis for proceeding down the particular path that Senator Coulter has described, however much&mdash;I repeat&mdash;we all regard the awful incident which occurred in Timor on 12 November as thoroughly abhorrent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to ask a supplementary question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not mean for a moment that I regard the events in East Timor as peripheral. However, it does mean that I think that those events should be looked at in the perspective that I have described. In the absence of any evidence at this stage either that they were directed as a matter of specific government policy or that they will be covered up and not followed through in an appropriate fashion, it is quite inappropriate for action of the kind that Senator Coulter seems to have in mind to take place. Of course, human rights issues are not peripheral to our relationship with Indonesia or anybody else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in particular, the human rights situation in East Timor is not peripheral. It has been a central focus of our involvement with Indonesia for very many years. We have made the judgment, over many years, that the realities of international life and the nature of the international willingness to go down the path of recognising rights to self-determination and so on are so limited and the realities are such that the human rights of the Timorese people are better pursued through active encouragement and general international pressure upon Indonesia to do that. That is the course that we have followed so far. It has been a productive course over the last few years. Tragically, however, that particular course came to a very unhappy and unsavoury halt with the events on 12 November. It is going to be a matter of judgment as to whether that course is capable of being re-created or whether some other course may need to be followed in the future. However, it is premature to make any such judgment at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is only part of it but a very important part. If one wanted to make savings out of those on sickness allowances, if one regards them as simply people from whom savings should be sought, the first thing one has to remember is that any savings have to be offset by the very considerable additional costs under health insurance arrangements to cover another 120,000 medical consultations a year. Even based on 85 per cent of the schedule fee, we are talking of more than $2m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at these arrangements, it has to be understood that the client currently meets the cost of the consultation fee for the initial medical certificate and subsequent medical certificate. That is already the client's responsibility. I am not sure whether Senator Faulkner is suggesting, as I think the Opposition has, that those two certificates have to be provided every 13 weeks, given that the length of time of the doctor's certificate is generally 13 weeks. But if that is the suggestion, with the kind of pressure that would be placed on sickness allowees, who by definition are not in the best of shape to start with, then it is the kind of suggestion that the Government would reject and reject out of hand.

That is deserving of note because it is a classic of its kind and redolent of the snake oil that will have to be used in the next 12 months to defend this impossible to defend policy.

Secondly, what further approvals to export military equipment to Indonesia have been given since 1989-90 and what is the exact purpose of the military training of Indonesian personnel conducted under the defence cooperation program?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my fan club for the reception. In relation to defence exports to Indonesia, the export guidelines have been scrupulously and properly met. The ammunition to which Senator Spindler refers, as he knows full well, is 4.5-inch naval ammunition used for practice purposes. He knows that, but everyone else has been saying, `Probably our ammunition was used in Dili'. That is absolute nonsense. None of our defence exports have ever been used for internal security purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler goes on to ask what other defence exports have been sent to Indonesia in the period 1989-90 and onwards. There are three:  first, material used for seismic testing, which because of its explosive nature comes under defence guidelines; secondly, cryptographic equipment, which comes under defence guidelines but in fact is for commercial use and not military use in Indonesia; and, thirdly, some engine and spare parts for DC3s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the totality of our defence exports to Indonesia. It is remarkably low. Indonesia does not seek to source its defence equipment within Australia&mdash;I assume for reasons of price rather than anything else. While Senator Spindler may not have been trying to imply that the ammunition was used in Dili, others who have been associated with him have. I think it is a good opportunity to at least put that to rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler went on to ask about Indonesians being trained under the defence cooperation program. This is a remarkable question. The defence cooperation program with Indonesia was cancelled in 1986. It has not been revived and will never be revived. It simply does not exist. In fact, as the honourable senator would well know, the defence relationship was somewhat strained from 1986 through to 1990. The tentative re-establishment of a reasonable defence relationship has occurred from 1990 onwards. That has occurred mostly at a senior level and is mostly aimed at trying to create a degree of transparency in our region so that there will be no military misunderstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator, although he did not ask for the number, asked whether Indonesians were involved in training in Australia. There are some, but far less than all of our other neighbours because this is a very tentative relationship which is being built up. I very much defend the type of military training that we provide because it broadens the horizons of officers coming from overseas and broadens their experiences of other cultures and other values. The one thing Australia is excellent at is training: having a disciplined and polished officer coming out the other end who will exemplify the best, not the worst, of military values. None of that training is to do with internal security matters; nor would the Indonesians ever expect it to be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the third point. Senator Spindler said first of all that AIDEX is primarily to promote the export of defence goods. The primary reason for any exhibitors being there is in fact to show their defence goods to the Australian defence forces and the Australian Department of Defence, because they are their big customers. I have had to repeat on many occasions for the honourable senator's benefit that the key to defence exports is not whether they are moral or amoral as such, but rather where one sends them and the nature of what one sends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator has tried time and time again to come up with examples that have eventually fallen on their face. He made reference to the overwhelming community support against AIDEX. I suspect that most of the community do not know about it. But I will tell the honourable senator something: rent-a-crowd and mob rule do not equate to policy.</PARA>

So we have to take a bit of pain ourselves. But it does not show overwhelming support when 400 or 600 people demonstrate in that way. I have had to warn my Defence Force that there is nothing more dangerous than a pacifist, because pacifists can belt the living daylights out of a person. If anything has proved that, it has been the events at AIDEX in the last few days. Whether AIDEX is good or bad is a point open for public debate.

Yet hardly a week goes by when we do not find either the Auditor-General saying that the work test is not being enforced or mobile review teams detecting that hundreds of millions of dollars are going astray in the welfare system.

The Government cannot explain why, when it first introduced these changes, the number receiving such pensions had already risen by 43 per cent over a 10-year period when the population growth rate was much less than 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer lies clearly in the number of phone calls that I get from doctors around Australia who complain to me that people going into the Department of Social Security asking for the unemployment benefit are being told that they would be much better off to go to the local doctor to get a certificate to be put on a sickness allowance. In due course, they would be transferred from the sickness allowance to an invalid pension. I would be pardoned for using the old terminology. That is precisely what is being put to me time and again from doctors in a number of States around Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has a lot of things wrong with him, but I do not think we can cure them with the invalid pension. The fact remains that there are very many people at the low end of the system&mdash;and again we know this because this is why the system was changed. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal said that people with impairment levels of less than 15 per cent were getting invalid pensions. There are administrative memoranda going around to that effect. That was clearly because the Department was prepared to turn a blind eye to people who had very low level disabilities&mdash;mild to moderate at best. They are the people that we are talking about tightening up on. Senator Richardson well knows that ACROD, the peak council in the area, also takes a very dim view of the lax administration in this area. That is where the savings are to be made, not just for the sake of savings but so that the Government can do some of the decent things that it ought to have done years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government knows that the Cass report recommended a disability allowance. It has been dithering about it for more than three years. We have done it. In this package we have said that we will give $45 per fortnight to those people at the severe end of the spectrum who are in need of additional assistance. It will cost $57m, but we are prepared to spend it, just as we are prepared to give money to the voluntary agencies, which the Government has not been prepared to do. The Government has not given one cracker. It has made a couple of derisory gestures and that is it. We are prepared to give $50m to those agencies to assist with emergency relief. We are also prepared to give $35m for labour market programs for the disabled. Again, our whole approach is to target those people most in need. Yet this outfit is prepared to say that all those who have managed to get themselves onto the list over the last 10 years can stay there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will look at people on disability support pensions on a very restricted basis. We estimate that only about 2 per cent will ever come up for a medical review. It is a nonsense, it is a disgrace, and Senator Richardson knows it. He knows how easy it is to get a medical certificate. In fact, all the incentives are in that direction: for people to go to their local doctor and ask for a certificate, particularly after they have been urged on by the Department of Social Security. That is simply not good enough. There ought to be independent assessments, as the Minister well knows. Quite often, a CMO might not be sufficient. There ought to be a second opinion. There are very many ways and means by which this system can be tightened up. But the answer we received was, `It is all too hard; it is all too expensive; there is no need to do any of this. Even people on 25 per cent are very seriously disabled'. I am surprised that he did not pretend that somehow someone on 15 per cent disability is very severely disabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson well knows the number of people who are not declaring income when they have mild to moderate disabilities. He well knows that it is very easy to get these sorts of payments with psychological conditions&mdash;conditions which are very difficult to rebut in many instances. The benefit of the doubt ought not to be given except on the basis of at least two medical reports. Functional overlays are notorious, yet there is no recognition from this Minister of that fact at all. Those people who genuinely believe, supposedly, that they have a physical disability that precludes them from working to a level at which, objectively, they are capable of working are not malingering, to use the jargon, but it is getting fairly close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the very least the Minister ought to be doing is reviewing those people. But, no, we never have any surprise visits; we do not even have mobile review teams out checking in this area. This has been an area of enormous blow-out under this Government. The totality of Senator Richardson's cosmetic changes means that we will not save money, we cannot save money; we are simply prepared to tolerate the status quo. We think that that is condemning these people to second-class citizenship status. Very many of these people would much prefer to be in the work force. They would be able to take advantage of programs such as Austrain, which we are prepared to offer to them. If people have been out of the work force for six or 12 months or longer, as perhaps 300,000 are likely to be under the Minister's status quo arrangements, those people will be able to be offered jobs for less than the award wage for a limited period. Ask the people involved. Do not just ask the mates of those opposite at the Trades Hall Council. Ask the people themselves whether they would be interested in taking jobs at 90 per cent of the award wage for 12 months. They would jump at the opportunity. Ask them if they would be prepared to work for 80 per cent. </PARA>

The Minister can try that line. He can go on spending $2.5 billion a year, throwing money away when it is not necessary, and the end result will be that he cannot afford to give a disability allowance; he cannot afford to give money for special labour market programs for the disadvantaged.

The award of a disability support pension is not about doing anybody a favour; it is about giving those with a severe medical impairment an opportunity for a decent standard of living. That is all it is. It is not about a favour; it is about a civilised society providing for some of its more unfortunate citizens a decent level of income support&mdash;nothing more and nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the disability support changes were put through this Parliament in very recent times, we moved away from 85 per cent incapacity as a means of determining who should be eligible or not eligible for these disability support pensions. We moved to a medical test, a 20 per cent impairment level. That was the test that we set and that is the level a person now has to pass. If a person cannot pass it, he or she will not get such a pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We estimated that between a quarter and a third of all new entrants to the system after 12 November would be eligible for some form of rehabilitation, some form of training. The kind of initiative Senator Alston is talking about we already announced in this Parliament months ago; it is already under way. But the real hoax here is the claim that these reviews will get $127m worth of savings. The opportunity for that is nil. This reform will cost money, save nothing, and create misery for hundreds of thousands of people who, by the very nature of their medical impairment, are obviously in pretty severe difficulty to start with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Senator Alston has any idea at all of the kinds of disabilities people have when they are on 20 per cent or 30 per cent impairment levels. Most of them tend to be in the 30 per cent to 40 per cent range, and they are people with very severe problems indeed. At 70 per cent, the level quoted in the Opposition document, such people are in very desperate trouble. The idea of those cases getting regularly reviewed is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens now is a much more sensible and workable proposal. Anyone who has any kind of medical doubt at all about them is scheduled for a review. The information for that will come from their treating doctor, from a Commonwealth medical officer or from a disability review officer in the Department. Where there is any evidence whatever that a person is receiving a payment to which he may not be entitled, he is reviewed now. The idea that one would put in mobile review teams to chase people with these levels of impairment is absolute nonsense. </PARA>

The real problem with mobile review teams is that they only make money if they are targeted on those places where the level of fraud is greatest. The great problem is that that is not here. Senator Alston has just missed the boat. Our medical reviews show a one per cent to 2 per cent rate of being able to get a cancellation of a pension: that is the rate that the Opposition will find when it applies this test. What will happen is that the test will be applied at massive cost and there will be no saving whatever. For no saving all there will be is great misery in the disabled community.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am going to quote everything they say about the outrage this is causing in the disabled community, about the misery this will cause the hundreds of thousands of people in this country who deserve, and get at the moment, a whole lot better. This Government will remain committed not just to doing them a favour but also to giving them what every civilised society knows is a right.

The first thing I want to do is refer to those who are being treated the most miserably as a result of this proposal. It is not just the unemployed who might find themselves on no benefit after nine months. If they are able bodied, at least they might have a show, miserable though it might be.

<PARA>According to Amnesty International, between 50 and 100 people were killed and scores were wounded when Indonesian security forces opened fire on a group of mourners at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili, East Timor, at about 8 a.m. on 12 November 1991. Dozens of others, including two foreign journalists, were beaten during the incident. At least 42 people, and possibly many more, have been detained. The victims were among hundreds of people who had gone to the grave of Sebastiao Gomes Rangel, a young man killed on 28 October when Indonesian troops entered the parish church of Motael, Dili, where he and about 20 other political activists had been hiding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eyewitnesses said that the procession was peaceful, although some members of the group had shouted pro-independence slogans and a flag of the nationalist movement Fretilin had been seen. Security forces, many of them carrying long sticks or truncheons, were in evidence along the route to the cemetery. However, with the exception of a brief scuffle between soldiers and young men at the tail end of the procession, no clashes and no physical confrontations were reported by non-governmental sources. According to one eyewitness account, a scuffle began near the Hotel Resende when a small number of soldiers ran after members of the procession and beat them with truncheons. The marchers retaliated by throwing stones and shouting, but no injuries were reported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shooting took place five to 10 minutes after the crowd had reached the cemetery. Some banners had been hung, people talked among themselves, and a number shouted pro-independence slogans. At this point, a large contingent of armed soldiers arrived from two different directions. Eyewitnesses said that hundreds of soldiers carrying M16 automatic weapons approached the cemetery on foot from one direction, while a smaller group&mdash;possibly of the paramilitary police mobile brigade&mdash;arrived in trucks from another direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to eyewitnesses, the foot soldiers marched to the entrance of the cemetery, formed a line about 12 men abreast, then opened fire on the crowd. No warning was given. Some soldiers reportedly fired into the air first, but others levelled their weapons straight at the crowd. The walls of the cemetery and the large number of people made it difficult to escape, but the shooting continued even as people tried to flee. Some were believed to have been shot in the back while running away. The shooting stopped and resumed several times, suggesting that it was planned and deliberate, rather than a spontaneous reaction to provocation. One eyewitness said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking down the road I saw body after body, and the soldiers kept firing at those who were still standing.</PARA>
<PARA>Amnesty International reports that other estimates of the number killed varied between 50 and 180. An Indonesian military spokesman said initially that fewer than 100 had died, but on 14 November the Government announced that `only 19' had been killed. Among those reported to have died of gunshot wounds was a student from New Zealand, Kamal Bamadhaj. Dozens of people were said to have been beaten badly during the incident, among them two US journalists, Alan Nairn and Amy Goodman. Anyone who heard Amy Goodman describe the massacre on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> radio program would not soon forget the broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The written word is a powerful tool, but the spoken words of an eyewitness are far stronger. The strongest and most shocking evidence of the massacre was the television footage taken by Max Stahl of Yorkshire Television. It is very distressing to read of people being killed; it is devastating actually to watch someone dying of appalling abdominal wounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable evidence that the Indonesian military is quite unrepentant about the incident. They have expressed official regret at the deaths and promised to investigate. On the one hand they have attempted to justify the massacre by claiming that security forces had used force when attacked by rioters, while on the other hand the commander in chief of the Indonesian armed forces, General Try Sutrisno, has been quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jayakarta</EMPHASIS> newspaper as saying, `These ill-bred people have to be shot'. I will quote a little from the translated article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Our armed forces are not like armies in other countries. Our people's army is very tactful.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turns out, the four-star general continued, that the patience shown by our officers was not appreciated; on the contrary, the disruptors became even more brutal. Then, some shots were fired into the air. `But they persisted with their misdeeds,' he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General Try Soetrisno then said that ABRI&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the armed forces&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would never allow itself to be ignored. `In the end, they had to be shot,' he said, reiterating his words that such disruptors had to be shot. `And we shall shoot them,' . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commander-in-chief called on the public not to panic, not to be influenced and to remain confident in ABRI's ability to resolve everything. `ABRI is determined  to crush anyone  who disrupts stability.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats, since the inception of the Party, have been consistently and loudly opposed to the Indonesian invasion and incorporation of East Timor in 1975. My predecessor in this place and my good friend, Colin Mason, constantly raised the matter in the Senate but received little support at the time. I am very encouraged by the outrage being expressed by so many groups and individuals, not only in Australia but throughout the world, over this massacre. There is a growing surge of activity in the European Parliament, the Netherlands, the USA, the UK, Portugal, Sweden, Canada and New Zealand. Australia must actively support cooperative international action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dili massacre has been a turning point in that it is simply no longer possible for the international community or our own Government to act as if the human rights situation in East Timor has been or is being resolved. While the events of 12 November represent the single most appalling tragedy in recent years, they are consistent with the pattern of abuse that has been inflicted on East Timor by the Indonesian authorities since 1975. The policy of successive Australian governments with respect to Indonesia may have produced dividends in some respects but it has clearly failed to offer any adequate or enduring protection for the rights of the Timorese people. Australian foreign policy in this respect must be reappraised as a matter of urgency. One key aspect of this must be a recognition that UN involvement is essential if genuine and lasting recognition of the rights of the Timorese people is to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will be moving an amendment to this urgency motion. In many respects it is a good, strong motion, although I do not believe it goes far enough in relation to military transfers or to Australia's role in the United Nations in bringing about a final resolution to the problems of East Timor. Indonesia has no historic, cultural or ethnic claim on East Timor. Indonesia is a close neighbour and, we are told, a friend of Australia's. One does not let one's friends murder their neighbours or their children. One does not let one's friends do things that are against their best interests. It is in everyone's best interests&mdash;Indonesians and East Timorese alike&mdash;for East Timor to be allowed self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are encouraged by the support for East Timor shown by so many in the Australian community, including members of all political parties.

<PARA>Community Aid Abroad has urged the Government to adopt the following four point action plan:  first, to support the sending of a United Nations force to protect East Timorese civilians; second, to dispatch immediately Foreign Minister Evans to Jakarta and Dili to facilitate talks between all concerned parties, including the Indonesian Government, Fretilin and the church; third, to suspend all military aid and defence equipment exports to Indonesia until the satisfactory commencement of such talks; and, fourth, to postpone the impending visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to Indonesia until the satisfactory commencement of such talks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amnesty International is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation into the circumstances of the massacre at Santa Cruz, and for guarantees that those responsible for extrajudicial executions or for the ill treatment of prisoners will be brought promptly to justice. It believes that investigations must be carried out by an independent body with no link to the security forces allegedly responsible for the massacre. It urges the Indonesian authorities to permit an investigation to be carried out under the auspices of a recognised international body, such as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Summary or Arbitrary Executions. Amnesty International is also seriously concerned for the safety of those arrested and is urging that those detained solely for their non-violent political activities or beliefs be immediately released and that, following their release, their safety be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeking in this urgency motion is achievable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What happened on 12 November in Dili was brutal and unconscionable. There may have been some provocation for a violent military response&mdash;in particular, the apparent stabbing of a battalion deputy commander and a private soldier early in the course of the demonstration&mdash;but on no version of the events which took place, not even the most extreme military version, could the degree of force that was clearly used on this occasion possibly be justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The course of events and the scale of the deaths and injuries associated with them is still not clear. The deaths are best estimated on the available evidence we have at around 75, plus or minus&mdash;certainly more than the 19 that have been acknowledged to date by the military authorities. As to the wounded, we now know that there are 89 people in hospital, but there are a number of others wounded who are still in hiding, and the death toll may rise as a result. At least the International Committee of the Red Cross has, in the last 24 hours, had access to those wounded in hospital and to those 47 people who are still in military detention as a result of the demonstration. That is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that there is no evidence that there was any deliberate or calculated decision or action of government involved in the conduct of this particular massacre, unlike the Tiananmen Square incident in China, where manifestly what happened was the result of a deliberate and calculated act of state policy. It does rather seem to have been aberrant behaviour by a particular group within the military. Whether that is the case will, of course, hopefully become clearer in the course of the investigation which is now under way. But our assessment of the situation, as being properly described in these terms, obviously does affect the nature of the response that the Australian Government has made to this situation as it has unfolded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian Government's reaction was initially very defensive. It also extended to an extraordinary and indefensible statement from the military commander-in-chief, to which Senator Bourne has already made reference. But it also has to be acknowledged that more recent statements issued after the first day have been more sensitive and more willing to acknowledge the enormity of the situation. In particular, we now have the presidential decree establishing the national commission of investigation&mdash;a really quite unprecedented thing to occur in Indonesian experience and a precedent that we of course welcome very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage there is no reason to assume that that national commission of investigation will not produce an inquiry which is, in the language of the presidential decree itself, `free, accurate, just and thorough'. We certainly hope it is, but we will have to wait and see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international reaction to the events in Dili has been strong&mdash;probably in no other country stronger than in Australia, which is understandable given the long history of concern with this issue at all levels of the Australian community and on both sides of the Parliament. But clear and unequivocal statements have been emerging from the European Community, the United States Congress and a number of other countries. A number of countries have communicated their concerns more privately than publicly, but the reality of that concern has been no less for that. Clearly, this weighed upon the Indonesian Government in coming to its welcome decision to establish a full and proper inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government's reaction was clearly articulated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during my absence overseas. It involved us seeking clear expressions of regret from the Indonesian Government, which have now, of course, been forthcoming. It involved seeking that a full and fair inquiry be conducted into all the circumstances of the massacre and, as I have said, that is now under way. We have also made it clear that we regard it as absolutely necessary that there be an appropriate follow-up involving appropriate treatment or punishment of those found guilty of unlawful or excessive conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Australian Government, has also made it clear that, beyond that response to the 12 November events themselves, we believe there needs to be a new approach to reconciliation with the East Timor people involving, as the Prime Minister put it, sitting down with the East Timor people&mdash;including the resistance forces&mdash;and trying to work out a program for achieving peaceable relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The options that confront the Government in terms of the current situation are, essentially, either negative or positive in character. We did have available to us a number of negative options and they have been vigorously pressed upon us by a number of lobby groups and individual parliamentarians. They basically involve action being taken to demonstrate concern, abhorrence and hostility at what has happened on the part of the Australian Government or people&mdash;measures such as the cancellation of ministerial visits, the cancellation of aid programs and the cancellation of the kind of cooperative military activity which does presently take place; matters of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government's position&mdash;as I have already indicated at Question Time&mdash;is that we believe such measures as this are quite premature to contemplate at this stage, given the embarking by the Indonesian Government on the course of investigation that we have urged upon it. It would be utterly at odds with that course of action for us to cut across the bilateral relationship and to make assumptions of guilt on the part of the Government, as it were, by putting in place negative measures of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a question as to whether measures of that kind will be, or are, productive or counterproductive for the people we are trying most to assist&mdash;in this case, the East Timorese. There is always a question as to whether such measures are in Australia's larger national interest. Given the course of the relationship and the significance of that relationship, not only to us but also in terms of multilateral cooperation on issues such as Cambodia and the establishment of APEC, there is always a question as to whether it makes any sense to deliberately embark upon a course of breaking down bilateral relations as an expression of protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need to address those questions at this stage. It is not appropriate to be thinking about any such measures. Nonetheless, in the Government's judgment it is appropriate to be thinking about some more positive measures which can be taken at this stage: measures designed to encourage the effectiveness of the investigation process now under way and to achieve a longer term resolution and reconciliation of the Timorese conflict in a way which meets the needs and aspirations of the Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people will say the only thing that could possibly meet the needs and aspirations of the East Timorese people would be the independence of East Timor following a UN-supervised act of self-determination and, presumably, a vote to that effect. That is probably too narrow a view of the situation. There is evidence, and quite a deal of evidence had been accumulating over the years before this incident, that a great many East Timorese people, perhaps a majority, would be content to have a society which involved them living in peace without an omnipresent military authority; which involved them being able to exercise rights of free speech and association; and which involved them being able to freely practise their religion&mdash;they are predominantly Catholic&mdash;and to exercise cultural freedom and independence, and gave them a measure of economic opportunity and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the course of action on which we believed the Indonesian Government was genuinely embarked in order to produce, over time, that kind of society in East Timor. The tragedy of the events of 12 November is that it so comprehensively put at risk the achievement&mdash;peacefully and within a reasonable timeframe&mdash;of the confident support of the East Timorese people for that kind of situation. We believe&mdash;and Australian policy has been firmly embedded in this particular course since 1979&mdash;that the only realistic future for the East Timorese people does lie with their acceptance of Indonesian sovereignty. In the mid-1970s we made very clear our opposition to the circumstances of the Indonesian takeover. In innumerable statements since I have made it perfectly clear that I have not changed my own personal view that what happened in 1975 was indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world inevitably, and sometimes unfortunately, moves on. Things which appear to be realistically achievable at one time become less so over time. The truth of the matter has been that the international community, from the late 1970s onward, lost interest in East Timor, and the prospect of achieving the process of self-determination, which was so widely called for in the mid-1970s, is probably no longer realistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the events of 12 November will change all that in terms of the international reaction but, on the evidence so far, I honestly do not think that is the case. I believe it makes more sense to operate within the framework of an acknowledgment of that reality which we have accepted on both sides of politics since 1979 and to try to improve the conditions of the East Timorese people within that framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some constructive things we can do, both in respect of improving the conditions of the people in the aftermath of the 12 November incident and also, as I have said, encouraging the investigation to be conducted effectively. Those things include, perhaps, a visit to Indonesia by me as Foreign Minister within the next few weeks, in recognition that diplomatic dialogue is likely to be a more productive way of achieving results than any available alternative course of action at this stage, particularly given the nature of the relationship and the degree of diplomatic capital, if you like, which has accumulated as a consequence of the good state of those relations in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second course that might be possible for us to take constructively is the exploration of a possible role for the United Nations, or more particularly its Secretary-General, in encouraging these developments. At the present time, there are problems&mdash;procedural and otherwise&mdash;in seeking any action in the General Assembly or in the Third or Fourth Committee or the UN Human Rights Commission. A more realistic approach in this respect would seem to be the utilisation of the good offices role of the Secretary-General, which is something we have publicly supported in the past and which the Indonesian Government has been prepared to accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another constructive thing we can do is to support actively the role of the Red Cross as a permanent monitoring presence, possibly by way of targeted financial assistance. The Red Cross has been playing a very important role in recent days in putting pressure on the Indonesian authorities to make information available, with some results which I indicated earlier suggesting that that cooperation is now more forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it is proposed that, as a constructive measure, we seek the establishment of an Australian consulate in Dili. It will, of course, depend on the Indonesian authorities as to whether that can go ahead, but it will be an important permanent presence in the province if it is able to be secured, with advantages flowing fairly obviously from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our attitude to the motion moved by Senator Bourne is reflected in what I have just said. In some ways we think the motion goes a little far in talking in terms of immediately sending fact-finding delegations to East Timor to investigate the Dili massacre. I think that is both unrealistic and unwarranted in terms of the action that is taking place now under the auspices of the Indonesian Government. I add, however, that the Australian Embassy has had people on the ground there for most of the period since the massacre, and the Australian Ambassador proposes to make early and regular visits to East Timor with this sort of thing in mind. Similarly with the reference to the UN facilitating talks, that may be a little more ambitious than is achievable or necessarily desirable at this immediate stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point I make about the motion is that we believe it is possible to say rather more than has been said by Senator Bourne and Senator Vallentine in their motion and to say it in a way that generates some of the balance I have been trying to put into the remarks I have just put on the record&mdash;the balance as between recognising the steps that have been taken, using language that makes unequivocally clear our condemnation of what has occurred, language that suggests that a rethinking of some aspects of Australian policy may well be justified if that investigation does not proceed satisfactorily, and language that identifies some of the constructive steps I have just spelt out. A weakness of the Opposition's foreshadowed amendment is that it goes only very selectively to the subject matter I have just described. In particular, it falls short of addressing both the constructive measures and what might appropriately happen in the event that the investigation is not satisfactorily conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge that the Senate adopt the amendment I shall seek to move using the procedures of this place. I make it clear for the record that this amendment has been adopted by the Labor Party room this morning and will be moved as a separate motion in the House of Representatives in another debate today. In terms of stating a clear consensus position, hopefully, across the parliamentary chambers, it would be useful to have this amendment adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by seeking leave to move an amendment to the urgency motion, the effect of which would be to substitute a substantive motion for the urgency motion in the terms that have been circulated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a great deal of common sentiment in the chamber this afternoon in relation to this issue. We join with the Australian Democrats and the Government in expressing our deepest distress over the incident in East Timor on 12 November 1991, which is the subject of this motion. Not only do we express our deepest sympathy for those who died, we think also of those who were injured and are presently hospitalised and of the families who have lost relatives in this tragic event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to debate the facts because they are only partly known at this time. They will become more apparent as time proceeds. They were put, in a form, by the Democrats' spokesman this afternoon. From my observation of the film to which she referred, which was taken by Yorkshire Television, there was obviously a lot that was valid in her description. In that film I saw a large number of rather excited young people waving banners for self-determination and independence. I saw no signs of an angry crowd and no signs of violence on the part of the protesters, who were at that time marching from the church where they had had a ceremony in memory of one of their colleagues who had died about a fortnight before in circumstances which are still not totally known. They were marching to his grave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) said, there are suggestions that an Indonesian major may have been stabbed during that march, but the incident in which it seems that the Indonesian armed forces opened fire on the crowd occurred some considerable time later. There does not seem to be, as the Minister said, any evidence on the table that would in any way amount to provocation to justify the incredibly heavy-handed reaction of the Indonesian armed forces. This is a tragic event that should never have occurred, and a lot of innocent young people have lost their lives as a result of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How should a country such as ours, which I think I can fairly say has a very different value base, react to such distressing circumstances? There is an issue of self-determination involved in this matter, of course, but we have not seen this violent act in such terms. We have seen this violent act primarily as an incident of what seems to be gross human rights abuse. The cause of the demonstration or the cause for this group of students joining together does not seem to us to be particularly relevant. What is important is that students reacting or protesting or taking other non-violent action should be entitled to do so without having to suffer the reaction of armed forces opening fire upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our attitude would have been the same, whether this incident had occurred in Indonesia or anywhere else in the world. We have hopefully moved into what some are describing as a new world order in which justice prevails and in which we have an international community more willing to comply with the international standards of human rights that have been now agreed. On the facts that we have before us so far relating to this incident, it would seem to be a gross abuse of the minimum standards that the international community has set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because it is an international issue, it gives us as Australians the right and the responsibility to protest way beyond anything that concerns bilateral matters. Regrettably, Indonesia&mdash;as we saw with China and as we see with some other countries&mdash;still seeks to regard such matters as internal matters. We press the same point upon Indonesia as we pressed upon China: these incidents can no longer be regarded as internal matters, domestic matters; they are matters of international concern in which the international community has a right and a responsibility to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What, therefore, should Australia do? What form of protest might most effectively reduce the chance of such a terrible event recurring? We are pleased about one aspect and that is that the Indonesian Government seems to have responded in this instance somewhat differently from its response to not dissimilar tragedies in the past. In this instance it has said that it deeply regrets the incident and the loss of life and that it will conduct a comprehensive investigation of all aspects of the incident. It has said that anyone `proven to have violated the prevailing laws' will be charged and tried in accordance with Indonesian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian Government has set up a national committee of investigation to carry out this inquiry, which is, as the Minister said and I agree, of an entirely unprecedented stature, to be headed by a Supreme Court judge with members drawn from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and Justice, the Parliament and the armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It demonstrates, I think, that the Indonesian Government sees that it does have a responsibility in this instance to properly investigate what occurred and to take appropriate action. We, of course, have pressed upon the Indonesian Government that such an inquiry should be open and free and that its deliberations should be in public; that its results should be made public; and that the Indonesian Government should bring criminal action against those who have demonstrated to have been in breach of the law. Only by such action will the Indonesian Government demonstrate to the international community that it is prepared to comply with what I described as the minimum standards of human rights which we are all now prepared to accept. The Governor of East Timor has been outspoken on the incident and has said that he will resign if the results of the investigations are not objective. I commend him for his courage in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fact that it should be an open and free inquiry is something which I took to the Indonesian Ambassador in Canberra last week. As I put to him, the Australian-Indonesian relationship is an important one. It will be severely soured by events such as this. It is in the interests of Indonesia that it demonstrate to the world that it will conduct an open, free and fair inquiry to get to the bottom of this tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from the Minister, Senator Evans, that he is of a mind to travel to Indonesia to put a similar point of view. If that is the case, we acknowledge that the sentiment is similar to that which we put to Indonesia's representative in Canberra last week. I am reminded of the fact that in 1975, after the Indonesian invasion, Andrew Peacock, the then Foreign Minister, on two occasions visited Jakarta to protest about the events that had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I must say that other visits are much more tricky, because it is very important that we do not send the wrong message to Indonesia. I have uttered words of caution regarding the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which, of course, was designed to be a goodwill visit. I think that the visit should very much depend on the conduct and the action taken by the Indonesian Government through its committee of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That brings me to the motion before the Senate today. I am concerned about aspects of the motion moved by the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine, because it seems to take the issue a step further. I do not think that sending a delegation from Australia will help the issue at the moment. I do not think reassessing our relationship in terms of aid or defence cooperation at this time will help in the issue. I do not believe that bringing the United Nations into it will assist either. I think the important thing is to maintain the pressure upon the Indonesian Government, which has the first responsibility to act in these circumstances to ensure that it carries out the open inquiry that I have referred to and takes the proper disciplinary action that might become apparent according to the findings of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I now move to the amendment that has been put by the Government which, as the Minister said, adopts the terms of a Caucus resolution which was passed this morning. Again, I am concerned by aspects of that resolution, because it also seems to me to go beyond that which is helpful at the moment. With regard to the first half of the resolution, which is put to us as the Government's amendment, I do not have a great deal of difficulty. I make just a few amended changes that I will mention in a moment. But the second half seems to raise the issue of self-determination, which I believe is unhelpful at this time. I notice that the proponents of that motion in this morning's Caucus have in fact gone to the press and said that it intended to be interpreted in those terms. They have put to the press that the language means a major change in the Australian Government's position in relation to East Timor. They said particularly that it should be interpreted as demonstrating support for self-determination. Senator Evans put it to us this afternoon that that is not the way in which it is to be interpreted, so we have a confused situation with the sponsors of the motion interpreting it one way and Senator Evans interpreting it another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, it seems to me that parts (g) through to (j) in the Minister's motion are premature. They raise matters that really prejudge the issues that are before the committee of inquiry. In some ways they are also repetitious in picking up earlier parts of the motion. They are also, in their language, somewhat confusing, which I suspect comes out of the debate that took place in Caucus. I therefore think, on balance, that it would be unhelpful to include them within the motion that the Senate will adopt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not wish it to be interpreted that by taking that attitude I am opposed to everything in the second half of the motion. In fact, I see that there is a suggestion for an Australian consulate in Dili, which I think might be quite helpful, bearing in mind particularly the close relationship with the East Timorese community in Darwin, which my colleague Senator Tambling will refer to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  I have incorporated the first half of the motion in the terms of our amendment. The change I seek to make is really in relation to the third part&mdash;to delete clause (c)&mdash;because I think the issue of what General Try Sutrisno said is something that needs further clarification. I have seen several interpretations of what he said and I would not wish to be part of a motion condemning him without being certain of what he said and that it was, therefore, something that should be condemned. I think that is therefore premature. The issue of political prisoners is one that is always debatable and I preferred to use the language of a call to release all prisoners detained without trial. I have made that change also in our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see some merit in the Australian Ambassador visiting East Timor in order to better inform the Australian Government. I think what is important is that the Australian Government keep the Parliament properly informed of the progress of the national commission of investigation; in other words, that the material the Government gets as a result of his visits is properly brought to our attention in order that we, as the people's representatives in this country, might take the appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will, therefore, move the amendment that I have circulated to the Government's amendment to the Australian Democrats' motion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know, that motion was carried unanimously by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned also that this event took place at a time when there was developing an improvement in the relationships in that area. I believe that there was a deliberate attempt by key Indonesians in East Timor to quieten things down, to ensure that people were able to go about their business with greater freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only time will tell what exactly happened on that fateful day. But we do need to get at the truth. We need to ensure that this is done openly and fully. We need to ensure that there are no scapegoats&mdash;whether they be individuals high up in the military establishment who may not have been directly involved or whether they be what the Indonesian security forces call gerakan pengacau keamanan; that is to say, security disturbing movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to have a repeat of the excuses given by the Indonesian authorities about the killing of two youths in Dili on 28 October. The Indonesian news magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tempo</EMPHASIS> reported the week after that the Government took the view that the deaths of the two students were the result of actions by rival gangs of youths. Reports outside Indonesia indicated that the victims were shot by security forces. I am concerned that the Australian Government was not able to answer why those two youths were shot. I commend the Government for its proposal to make sure that greater attention is paid by our embassy in Jakarta to the situation in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, what has happened to the truth in regard to the Dili disaster?  The immediate response by Indonesia to the massacre was to claim that only 19 people were killed. It was claimed that the killings occurred because soldiers misheard an order not to fire, and that it was a misunderstanding. We now know that eyewitness reports, video footage and even the reported remarks of the ABRI chief of staff, Try Sutrisno, bear out the fallacy of that initial pathetic claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that quite a number of people in Jakarta have been arrested since the massacre. It has been suggested that those people have been released. However, information that is available indicates that is not so, that they have been carted away and that many of them have not been released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do need to find out the truth. As friends, Indonesia and Australia need to be able to trust each other and share the truth with each other. The first element of trust is openness and truthfulness between two friends. I believe that is what is needed more than anything else right here and now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether the national commission of investigation is able to arrive at the truth. I note that the chairman of the national commission, Judge Jaelani, served in several military units in West Java, including as commander of the army's paracommando regiment in Batujajar in Bandung in the 1950s. That does not disqualify him from being chairman of this commission obviously, nor does it disqualify him from being a supreme court judge. But, it might&mdash;as with some of the other members on the committee&mdash;prevent many of the East Timorese from presenting themselves before the commission with full confidence. However, it is absolutely essential that this should happen if we are to arrive at the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am interested in the Government's proposal which indicates a role for the United Nations and its Secretary-General, and the International Commission of the Red Cross in regard to matters relating to human rights violations. I believe that it would be in Indonesia's interests and, indeed, in our own interests for this inquiry to be undertaken by, say, an international organisation such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights or by the International Commission of Jurists. Clearly, that would serve our joint interest in arriving at the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at the idea of cooperative conflict resolutions in this field because we have common security interests as well as many other interests. My view is that this inquiry would be better undertaken by an internationally respected body. Not that I reflect on the members of the commission. All I am saying is that I do not believe many of the East Timorese would feel confident in going before that body. If they are not confident in doing that, the Indonesians, ourselves and the world will not ultimately arrive at the truth of this tragic affair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate my support for the viewpoints expressed in particular in the amendment moved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. I take some responsibility for a significant part of that amendment as I, Mr Gibson and Senator Sherry were involved in the negotiations which resulted in this document going to the Labor Party Caucus this morning where it was unanimously accepted. Basically I think it is fair to say that it looks at the short term and the long term. It expresses the repugnance and horror about the massacre felt by all members in this chamber, and it makes that repugnance and horror absolutely obvious to the Indonesian Government, and particularly to those responsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it sets out a step by step approach to the way in which we should be dealing with the Jakarta Government, particularly over matters relating to human rights and to East Timor. The step by step procedure that we have outlined in the amendment by Senator Gareth Evans that we drafted last night is an attempt to ensure that cooler heads prevail and that the long term relationships that we have with our near neighbours, especially Indonesia, are improved. But more importantly, it is an attempt to ensure that they are improved on the basis that our neighbours have a full understanding as to where we stand on matters relating to human rights, on prisoners detained without trial, prisoners who are tortured in Indonesian gaols and on summary execution; and in particular to the way that we view the rights of the citizens of East Timor. That concern is expressed very adequately indeed in the amendment moved by Senator Gareth Evans, which was contained in a series of motions and steps passed by the Labor Party Caucus this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that nobody is under any illusions about the special role that the military plays in Indonesian society, and I might say in some other societies in South East Asia. That role is much greater than the role played by the military in countries such as Australia. There are many people in Indonesia who hold simultaneous posts in the armed forces and in the civilian bureaucracy. There are some who have been trained in the armed forces and who have  then gravitated  to  the  civilian  bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also understand the particular problems that apply to the holding together of a massive country in an archipelago of thousands of islands, many people of different religions and different backgrounds, and that in itself is not an easy task. The total falling asunder of the Soviet Union, for example, should teach us that there are some people of a conservative political nature who will do anything to keep a country together. What we as Australians should be doing&mdash;and what Senator Gareth Evans has proposed is the best way to go about it&mdash;is to indicate even to those in the military in Indonesia that there are better and more effective ways of keeping a country such as that together than simply singling out certain regions and punishing dissent in those regions. I do not think it is an accident that sooner or later this happened in East Timor rather than in some other more troublesome areas of the Indonesian archipelago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go on about that, but it serves to indicate that this is a very delicate area, but in no way should it prevent Australia making its views plainly known about the abuse of civil rights in East Timor that has occurred and is occurring. In no way does it allow Australia to draw back from saying, `We want a fair, open, frank and honest inquiry about the incident and the murders that occurred on 12 November in Dili'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To inject a note that is not bipartisan, I am disappointed at the way in which the Liberal and National parties have attempted to amend Senator Gareth Evans's amendment. There seems to be a drawing back from this willingness to be honest and from saying, `We do not accept your view of human rights in Indonesia'. There is a drawing back from a number of very important moves or steps that the Australian Government is about to take. In our amendment we said that a consulate should be set up in East Timor immediately so that we have official eyes and ears on the ground. The Liberal and National parties have pulled back from that request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also said that the United Nations, basically through the Secretary-General, should be involved. Those in the National and Liberal parties have pulled back from that and said that we do not need that process. For example, we have indicated our repugnance at the reported remarks of the Indonesian military, particularly the Indonesian commander-in-chief on the day following the massacre, in which he said, `The disrupters had to be shot'. To pull that out of our amendment is to let the Indonesians off the hook, and particularly those Indonesians who have a view that there is only one solution, as they call it, to the East Timorese problem, and that is repression. </PARA>

There can be no justification for the use of force against a civilian population. Many territorians have families in Indonesia with whom they have close contact. We now have many Australian citizens of Indonesian descent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions that are raised about the local military administration certainly have to be brought out and the seriousness brought home time and again. The comments attributed in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> to Governor Mario Carrascalao of East Timor after he returned from a visit to Jakarta are very important:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"They are not very well informed", he told the Lisbon daily, Publico. "They have only been told half-truths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The massacre was not something that happened on the spur of the moment. There were antecedents", said Mr Carrascalao, who had threatened to resign after the shooting unless Jakarta held a full inquiry and brought to book those responsible.</PARA>
<PARA>We have now seen the international media attention and focus, and often confusion, on this issue. There is a need for information and investigation. The initial confusion by the Indonesian authorities is borne out in many ways. Senator Aulich has referred to our proposed deletion of one particular quote&mdash;it is evident&mdash;but I took offence to another, a statement by Admiral Sudomo on 15 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In anticipating the incident the security apparatus had taken persuasive measures to calm the crowd but a few radical elements had attacked and tried to seize the arms of the security apparatus which had led to cause casualties on both sides.</PARA>
<PARA>If we wanted, I am sure we could find many more appropriate quotes to include in this debate. We must join the international community in calling for a full and open investigation to ensure that all who are responsible for the events are properly brought to account in accordance with, firstly, Indonesian laws and, secondly, internationally accepted standards of human rights. The inquiry must be open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to be mindful of the historical context of this problem: the very nature of past Indonesian authority; the way in which it has exercised itself; the peculiar size of the country that we are talking about with its 180 million people; and the fact that East Timor had 400 years essentially of failed colonial administration by Portugal. We need to recognise that the ethnic people of both East and West Timor have the same cultural background, even though before 1975 they had different administrations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">August to December 1975 saw a bloody civil war after Portugal abandoned its colony. The interests that we need to recognise are that the marxist Fretilin on the one side pitted against the UDT, APODETI and Kotis interests on the other resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people. It was genocide on a grand scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these hidden agendas are behind the debate today: the many vested interests of the Portuguese and their recent activities, particularly youth activities, in their former colony; the Portuguese interests with regard to their financial claims on the Timor Gap developments; the roles and involvement of the churches; the activities of Fretilin that have continued since 1975; and the roles of the international Left with regard to wider political objectives in Indonesia. The self-determination arguments of many people should not be on the agenda of this debate. We need to come back to talking about the issues of human rights and not guising a self-determination agenda under peculiar motions in peculiar ways. </PARA>

It is very important to note that sitting today in the gallery is the Parliamentary Secretary of the Northern Territory Cabinet, Rick Setter, who has taken a particular interest in this matter. The speech of the Northern Territory Leader of the Opposition, Mr Ede, was particularly relevant and important. I would love to take the time, but I do not have it, to quote from the speeches of many of the members of the Legislative Assembly, including the Minister for Industries and Development, Mr Hatton, and Mr Ede. However, I will quote the former Labor leader of the Legislative Assembly, Mr Terry Smith, who has just retired:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot get away from the fact that a massacre has taken place; that it has taken place on our doorstep, an hour's flight away; and that it has taken place involving the families of fellow Territorians.

<PARA>Further on he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is often said by the government that we, because of our closeness to Asia, have a special responsibility to develop that closeness and to develop ties with our Asian neighbours, and I agree. However, equally, if we accept that our closeness gives us a special responsibility to develop closer ties, our closeness also gives us a special responsibility to stand up and be counted when something drastic and dramatic and as terrible as this thing has happened.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Robert Hill and I met last week with Ambassador Siagian. I believe to this day that we are the only politicians to have sought and obtained an interview with him.

I certainly have good working relationships with the Indonesian consulate in Darwin and I intend to keep them up.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe no purpose whatsoever will be achieved by breaking off educational, trade and diplomatic links with the Jakarta Government. Because of 10 years of solid work by the NT Government, I am able to put the view of our Timorese community, and express the horror of the community in general over recent events in Dili to senior Indonesian Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in that letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suggest to you that more can be achieved by maintaining all forms of communication, both trade and diplomatic, by asking directly what happened in East Timor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>There are so many situations that we need to address in this particular debate. However, it is the future that we must look to and develop. The eyes of the world are on Indonesia today and it needs to recognise that it cannot walk away from the influence of television and radio and its responsibility to respond publicly. We do have important trade links. Indonesia has a responsibility to adopt a good neighbour policy and that policy involves us in many areas of vital and reciprocal interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks today by quoting from an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 14 November that I believe is extremely relevant. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trade and commerce, cultural and sporting exchanges are ultimately the things which change societies and make them better. That has been the case in the past with European nations and will be the case with other developing nations around the world. Sure the Indonesian government should be left under no misapprehension that the actions of its soldiers in East Timor can in any way be condoned. It should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Nor should the Indonesians believe Australia will be less shocked by the events next door than it was, for example, with Tiananmen Square. It simply means neither the Indonesians nor ourselves can afford to withdraw into a shell. Now perhaps less than ever. Geography has thrown us together and, whether anyone likes it or not, that will remain the case after Dili.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said six weeks ago, I found my visit to East Timor a terribly depressing experience from the point of view that, in contrast to other parts of Indonesia, East Timor struck me as being basically a military camp. There is no doubt that there are tens of thousands of combat troops in East Timor. Although the military presence has been scaled down over the past four or five years, it is still outwardly a very strong military presence. At least 100,000 people have died in East Timor over the past 15 years, as a result not only of internal civil war but also of direct, quite brutal Indonesian military occupation and repression that continues today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there has been a considerable improvement in the situation over the past three or four years. There has been some improvement in roads and education, but one has to ask what the value of paved roads is for people in a subsistence economy, who have to walk everywhere. One has to ask the value of education when there is no employment or industry at all in East Timor except a basic subsistence agriculture. I have no doubt that there is an overwhelming desire for the East Timorese people to have a say in their future and for it not to be determined solely by a central government in Java.

It deals with the massacre and our sympathy for the families of the persons who have died; it deals with the very important issue of human rights; and it deals with the issue of the Australian Ambassador being asked to visit East Timor at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of issues outlined in the amendment which, regrettably, those opposite cannot support. It includes such things as a call on the Australian Government to be a lot more active in terms of United Nations involvement in East Timor and the call for Senator Evans to visit East Timor in the very near future to place very clearly on the record our position on East Timor. The amendment also refers to negotiations that should take place between the central Indonesian Government and the legitimate representatives of the people of East Timor. It refers to the role of the Red Cross and also the establishment of a consulate in Dili, which I think is a very good idea. I regret to say that those opposite do not support those last points in the amendment. I have to pose the question: why? What positive approach do those opposite propose to take to resolve the conflict in East Timor?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as he has made very clear&mdash;and his comments are included in the amendment&mdash;his attitude to the situation in East Timor. In fact, the Prime Minister has expressed the clearest and strongest views of any political leader in the past 15 years. I congratulate Senator Harradine for the contribution he has made to this issue. As a fellow Tasmanian senator, I have known of Senator Harradine's strong interest in East Timor over a long period of time. Like Senator Harradine, I share a desire to have a close friendship with Indonesia because Indonesia will be one of the most important countries in terms of the economic development of Australia. However, a good relationship, a sound relationship and being good friends means that on occasions we will disagree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our relationship with Indonesia and our overall interests are important, but what is also important is that 100,000 to 200,000 people died in East Timor during a brutal and illegal military occupation. It is very clear that around the world there is almost no comparable example of a country illegally occupying a colony. It has not been tolerated or accepted in any other part of the world. Because of its failure in 1975 and 1976 and the years following, Australia carries a heavy moral responsibility for what has occurred in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this country is to participate in what I hope will be a new world order; if this country is to participate in the way we did earlier in the year&mdash;which I supported on principle and I still firmly support&mdash;we have to be consistent in the application of our principles. Certainly, the facts are different in East Timor, but there is no doubt that the illegal military occupation should end forthwith and that the East Timorese people should be allowed to have some say in their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a personal point of view, if the inquiry into this situation is not satisfactory, I will be pushing my Government to end this de jure recognition of Indonesian occupation of East Timor and to end any military exchange programs. This is an ongoing issue. Simply passing a motion today in the Senate does not mean that the campaign to ensure some justice for the East Timorese should cease. This is an ongoing issue that has received some impetus, regrettably, by the massacre in East Timor. Of course, the international situation has changed quite dramatically in the past two years. We should not stop here. We should continue the campaign to ensure that the people of East Timor obtain justice and some sort of self-determination and freedom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with all other senators in expressing my abhorrence of the killings that occurred in Dili recently, particularly as they were unprovoked killings of unarmed civilians. That situation appals all honourable senators. It is right that this chamber should express its very deep concern and its very deep sympathy to the people of East Timor for the appalling tragedy that they experienced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendment moved by Senator Hill, which basically contains the same thoughts and sentiments as that moved by Senator Evans. I am particularly pleased to see bipartisan support calling for a free and open investigation. I am pleased to hear of the unprecedented nature of the investigation being set up by the Indonesian Government in that the people appointed to it, as Senator Hill pointed out, are quite exceptional people. It is indeed pleasing to be able to join with all other senators in calling for that inquiry to be free, accurate, thorough and fair and also for appropriate action to be taken against those who might be found to have been guilty of excesses and unlawful acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear from Senator Evans that the International Committee of the Red Cross has in fact today or yesterday been given access to the wounded in hospital and to people detained. I think that is, again, an indication that the Indonesian Government is prepared to allow the investigation to proceed fairly and to allow the ICRC to proceed with its investigations as it would wish to do. I also support the proposal in Senator Hill's amendment which mirrors other proposals for the Australian Ambassador to play a role in obtaining information and reporting to the Parliament on what has happened in Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy that occurred in Dili very recently has, of course, its groundings in the long, rather unfortunate history of that particular part of the world. The Portuguese, who controlled East Timor for most of its recent history, had a terrible record. I think that some of the pronouncements that the Portuguese are now making are somewhat hypocritical. When the Portuguese walked out of East Timor in the midst of a very bloody civil war, their record had been nothing but appalling. When they walked out, only eight per cent of the local population could read or write. There were no sealed roads, very few schools, very few bridges and very few hospitals there. I would suggest that the words `human rights' were simply not part of the Portuguese dictionary at the time they governed Timor. I quote from an article written in 1974 which the Research Service has obtained for me about the Portuguese rule in that territory:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as 1947, forced labour was being used for the construction of roads and other public works. An Australian officer of the War Graves Commission saw the system in operation at the time in the Viqueque area. The system appears to have been commuted to an annual poll tax but more recent descriptions of cowed and frightened behaviour of Timorese in the presence of Portuguese and the tenacious custom of saluting all Europeans offer some indication of the nature of the colonial relationship.</PARA>
<PARA>It was an appalling relationship. To compound it, the Portuguese walked out on that community amidst a very bloody civil war in which tens of thousands of people were slaughtered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the groups involved was the communist marxist group of Fretilin, which caused some 40,000 to 50,000 refugees to migrate to West Timor at the time. The population of the capital city, Dili, decreased from 25,000 to 5,000. It was a terrible situation. It was into this situation that the Indonesian Government came and took over. There will be a lot of argument always regarding the takeover by the Indonesian Government, but it came into that situation at a time when tens of thousands of people were being massacred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesians have tried very hard to rule properly in that community, as they have tried in the rest of their community. Indonesia is a country of some 13,670 islands, 6,000 of which are inhabited. There are 191 million Indonesians from 300 separate ethnic groups speaking 250 separate languages. Indonesia is our closest neighbour and is a major and increasing trading partner. Of the community in Indonesia, some 87 per cent are Muslims, and the balance are Christians and other minor religions. To us, Indonesia is our gateway to Asia. It is a neighbour with whom we have worked in very many constructive ways in recent times, and Senator Evans mentioned the Indonesian Government's contribution to the good work that has been done in Cambodia in which Australia played a very large part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The East Timor province, with a population of about 737,000, 120,000 of whom are in Dili, has been for the last couple of years run in the same way as any other Indonesian province. It has received an enormous amount of money from the Indonesian Government&mdash;far more than any other region of Indonesia and, certainly in one year, far more than the Portuguese ever put into that community in the whole of their time there. It is run in the same way as any other province. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is instructive to mention the principles of Pancasila, which govern all Indonesians. Firstly, they believe in one God. This principle affirms the Indonesian people's belief in God. Secondly, they believe in a just and civilised humanity. This principle indicates the respect which should be shown to all human beings regardless of sex, religion or political beliefs. Thirdly, it speaks of unity. This principle embodies the unity of the Indonesian nation. Fourthly, it talks of democracy and decision-making by a process of deliberation designed to reach a consensus rather than one group imposing its will on others. The fifth principle of Pancasila, social justice, is the principle that demands the equitable spread of resources to the whole population. It indicates the protection of the weak in the society so that a just and equal society can be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the principles by which the Indonesian nation is run. Those principles apply right throughout. It is, therefore, somewhat distressing to see what happened in Dili recently. It has happened, I suggest, not through the urgings or the directions of the Indonesian Government or its senior officials but through the horrendous actions of people holding very minor positions of authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My visit to Indonesia with Senator Sherry brought me into contact with the Governor, Mario Carrascalao, and the military commander, Brigadier-General Warouw. I join Senator Sherry in his opinions of these people. I quote from Senator Sherry's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give considerable credit to the Governor of East Timor, Mario Carrascalao, and to the military commander, Brigadier-General Warouw, with whom we spent quite some time. There is no doubt that these two individuals have made a very determined and conscientious effort to improve the situation in East Timor under their jurisdiction. I give them considerable credit for their openness and frankness in discussing with us the problems in East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA>I would go even further and say that I found them both to be particularly sensitive to the issues in East Timor and to be trying their best to do the right thing. There are provocateurs at home and abroad who would be unhappy with a peaceful solution to the East Timorese situation in which all parties could get together and live happily together. But it should not stop the rest of the world from trying to achieve that solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noticed the army presence in East Timor. But I do say that a lot of the army presence I noticed was from the territorial army: the engineers, the doctors and the civilian troops who were spending time there on civilian projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can always be very quick to blame others for human rights abuses. Our own record with Aborigines, as the inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody shows, is not quite as good as we would like it to be. We have also given many confused signals around the world about our attitudes to Tiananmen Square, Fiji, African human rights and the Balkans. Whilst in no way diminishing our horror at and the abhorrence of the unprovoked killings, I look towards the future of Indonesia and its relationships with Australia and the world, about which both Senator Hill and Senator Tambling spoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to try to encourage trade and tourism. We have to do anything that will get a greater Australian presence into East Timor, and I support the proposal for a consulate in East Timor. I come from that part of the world&mdash;Townsville, Cairns and northern Australia&mdash;where we have very close relationships with the Indonesians, very close trading relationships, where a lot of people are involved with the Indonesians on a daily basis, and that relationship should continue. Our involvement with Indonesia has increased; as recently as last Friday Garuda International opened a new air link into Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the amendment moved by Senator Evans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share the concern and expressions of sympathy that have been offered today by honourable senators around the chamber to the East Timorese community in Australia and, of course, to their families and friends back home who have suffered this enormous tragedy. I express sympathy not only for the Dili massacre and for the other massacres that have followed since then&mdash;we should keep that in mind&mdash;but also for all that has gone before that, for everything that has happened since 1975. Along with some other senators who have spoken here today, I apologise for Australia's stand in 1975 and since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer back to the original motion moved by Senator Bourne and me earlier today. We deliberately worded this motion very cautiously in order to seek cross-party support; we know that there is genuine cross-party concern for what has happened in East Timor. Our intention was to put forward a motion that could be supported by the Senate of Australia, that would send a very strong message to the Indonesian Government via our own Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have had two significant sets of amendments to our motion. I would really have preferred our motion to be much stronger, because obviously it is not going to get through. So I will put on record what I would have preferred to say in the beginning. That was&mdash;and I am sure Senator Bourne shares this particular aspect with me&mdash;that we would like to see Australian military aid and defence equipment exports to Indonesia not just reassessed but discontinued. We feel strongly that Australia does have a responsibility for aiding the Indonesian military. No matter how good our intentions might sound or how good our intentions might be, obviously we are aiding and abetting the Indonesian military and we can see the result, particularly in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second matter I would like to have added to the original motion is that Australia should rescind its de jure recognition of Indonesia's takeover of East Timor in 1975. Other senators have referred to this. We deliberately did not put that into the motion because we knew that it would be difficult for the Government and that the Opposition probably would not support it either. But a lot of the problems stem from the fact that during that tragic time Australia really sat on its hands and did nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is tragic that, in the year when self-determination is back on the international agenda, it has taken this massacre in Dili to bring back concern about East Timor after the international community has looked the other way for 16 years. That is apart from a few motions that have come intermittently before the United Nations during that time. I remind the Senate of the words of our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the crew of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Darwin</EMPHASIS> on 13 August 1990 as he sent them off to the Gulf:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's important for Australia that the world understands big countries cannot invade small countries and get away with it.</PARA>
<PARA>When the journalists asked him about East Timor as an analogy, he simply brushed it off and refused to answer the question. That is what has happened here repeatedly, because I have raised that question with the Minister as well: it has been dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December last year, I asked Senator Evans what was the difference between Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and Indonesia's invasion of East Timor. He offered some totally inadequate excuses about East Timor being a colony and not a sovereign state, that it had all happened a long time ago and we could not do much about it. In fact, he said that there was no need to contemplate any change of policy, and he denied that there was the growing international body of opinion that I had referred to concerning the rights of self-determination for the East Timorese. I find it strange that, at a time when the Baltic states have achieved their independence after 50 years of occupation, a period when the Australian Government refused to acknowledge Soviet authority over those three countries, Senator Evans can say that it is too late to change our position on East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wrong that was committed in 1975 can be corrected. It should not be compounded by continuing with that recognition. Australia is one of the very few countries in the world that has recognised Indonesia's takeover of East Timor. We should not refuse to admit that we were wrong in the past; we are compounding the problem by so doing. I commend the Liberal member of parliament from South Australia, Chris Gallus, who said at a rally outside Parliament House on 12 November that both the Labor Government of Gough Whitlam as well as the current one and the Liberal Government of Malcolm Fraser bore some of the responsibility for the situation in East Timor today. That was borne out by Senator Aulich and Senator Sherry in their speeches this afternoon, and I am glad they had the courage to say that; I think it is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we really need to see is this Government working for talks between the East Timorese and Indonesia to resolve the conflict along the lines suggested last year by East Timorese resistance leader Xanana Gusmao. Senator Evans worked long and hard to bring an end to the conflict in Cambodia, and I have commended him for his dedication. I find it sad that he is not prepared to bring his skills to bear on following up these proposals with regard to East Timor and Indonesia. We should be pushing hard in the United Nations for this issue to be put on the agenda, as Senator Evans went in to bat on the Cambodia issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the leader of the Catholic Church in East Timor, Bishop Belo, has repeatedly stressed self-determination. In February 1989 he wrote to the United Nations pointing out that the East Timorese had not been consulted and were calling for a United Nations referendum. Despite this, in the same year the Australian Government was prepared to sign the Timor Gap treaty, dividing up the oil in the Timor Gap with Indonesia rather than with the people of East Timor, for which Australia has been taken to the International Court by Portugal. The outcome of that will be quite interesting to see. I think the Timor Gap treaty is another reason why the Australian Government is so reluctant to take the Indonesian Government to task. The East Timorese consider that it is stolen oil; it is their oil, not Indonesia's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that Indonesia is a state created from what was once the Dutch East Indies. The colonialism bogy comes back to haunt us many times. At the time of its creation, Indonesia did not lay claim to the territory of East Timor, not even under President Sukarno. The United Nations has declared the 1990s the decade for the eradication of colonialism. There is to be a special effort over the next 10 years to clear up the 15 or so remaining decolonisation issues. East Timor, of course, is one of these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still find it very difficult to understand the inconsistency on East Timor that the Australian Government perpetrates. I am glad that much of what Senator Evans has put in his proposal is acceptable in getting the United Nations in on the act, but I think we should be going further than he has suggested. I am in favour of improving relations with Indonesia, but I am not prepared to be selective about human rights. It is important to note that the SBS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dateline</EMPHASIS> program indicated last Friday that this Government has known all about Indonesia's operations in East Timor since 1975 through the activities of the Defence Signals Directorate in the far north of this country. As a member of the Cabinet since 1983, Senator Evans cannot claim ignorance of Indonesian military operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been very obvious from the debate this afternoon, this is an issue that crosses party boundaries. We all want the situation to improve for the East Timorese people and we all want the killings to stop. There were many old soldiers in 1975 who remembered the thousands of East Timorese who gave their lives fighting with Australians against the Japanese between 1942 and 1945. It is the case that many of their families believe that they have been betrayed by Australia. This is a very sad situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not be supporting Senator Hill's amendment for the reasons outlined very clearly by Senator Aulich who, I think, demolished some of the problems that were raised. I would like to make one comment about part (g) of Senator Evans's amendment which talks about the suspension of military training programs in the event that the Indonesian investigation and follow-up action are unsatisfactory. I find that far too weak. However, I very reluctantly have to agree with the Government's amendment, although I do not agree with that part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, Senator Bourne and I deliberately worded our motion to be inclusive enough and cautious enough to get full party support.

First of all, I hope that the drought will have broken. Secondly, whether or not the drought has broken, I hope that the Committee will come up with some suggestions and ideas that will help people in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another Agricultural Council resolution related to national guidelines for feedlots. The Queensland Minister for Primary Industries led a discussion on feedlots and their market potential.

This meeting occurred at a time when the Australian rural sector had been facing a very pessimistic future. In fact, the outlook continues to be bleak with this week's news that one of the last sources of water for many rural communities in western New South Wales, the Darling River, has been badly polluted with the highly toxic blue-green algae. This is on top of a devastating drought, which is proving to be the death knell for many farmers in my own State of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, a number of highly contentious and urgent issues were considered at the Ministers policy session. These issues included:  an overview of development and related policies, including an update of the GATT-Uruguay Round; market development in Asia; coordination between Commonwealth and the States on agricultural trade opportunities; national guidelines for feedlots, about which my colleague Senator Brownhill spoke; drought policy; and the relative role of agriculture in economic and public policy implementation. It would have been interesting to have been an observer at the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Uruguay Round and the trade issues, the report notes on page 2 that the Chairman assured Council of the Government's continuing efforts to attain meaningful reform of agriculture and agricultural trade policies.

What concerns me greatly is that it did this without regard to the impact of its policies on the competitive conditions within which producers in each of those industries work.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are saying . . . that because we are on the altar of free trade, because we want to be able to hold our hands on our hearts and say to the Europeans, to the Americans and to the Japanese that we are acting as we believe they should act, we will be in a better position to ensure that they do so.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, in doing so, we place a number of our major industries in a position where there will be even more unemployed; where there will be an even larger number of those engaged in the TCF industry shutting up plant and moving offshore; and where in the sugar industry and the vegetable industry we will find that imports will take over their market share. Reduction of tariffs in these areas as some sort of grand gesture, while they are not being matched by our trading competitors, is a warm inner glow nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The record and resolutions of the seventh meeting of the Australian Soil Conservation Council on 2 August 1991 deal with a subject that is very close to my heart. I have spoken about soil conservation quite a lot in this place. It is one of those issues which I believe should be basically apolitical. It is something we should all strive for because, basically, soil is where it all starts: the growing of our crops provides a livelihood to the people who grow them; and the food that is produced sustains people through life. It also gives us a great export income. It all stems from the soil, as I think Fallowfield, that memorable English gentleman, said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Chairman of the Soil Conservation Council, the Hon. Simon Crean, said in his opening remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . perhaps for the first time, the Commonwealth and States were close to adopting a national strategic approach to soil conservation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is fantastic. He went on to say that this was a positive development, particularly in the context of the outcomes of the Special Premiers Conference. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was now a clear vision to guide future efforts&mdash;"sustainable land use by the year 2000". The Decade of Landcare Plan would provide the road map.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community landcare continued to be the main focus of attention for governments in facilitating more sustainable land uses. Community interest and involvement in landcare groups and activities continued to be high. There were now over 900 landcare and related groups.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is commendable and wonderful. It is something about which we should all be very happy and proud. But, unless guidance comes from the Commonwealth powers and the Australian Conservation Council, and incentives are given to the people at the coalface to actually do something about it, it will be only rhetoric. We do not want that; we want things to actually happen at the coalface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my concerns is that the money that is put into land care is used correctly and is used where it is meant to be used: by the end-users. If it falters now and if the money is not forthcoming as part of a budget to look after our soil to keep this decade of land care operating in a proper manner, we will find that we will be the losers in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice also that the Australian Soil Conservation Council made mention of drought. It made the point that the differences in the approach between the Commonwealth and State governments precluded the development of a national drought policy. I have already mentioned that, hopefully, the rural and regional affairs committee might be able to help them to get it all together somewhere along the line. The Commonwealth does not differentiate between degrees of severity of drought, whereas the States have agreed that a national drought policy should make provision for extreme drought, with clearly defined special assistance measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Commonwealth and the States agreed that there was a need to improve farmers' risk management skills. Here, again, guidance has to be given and a lead has to be taken so that people can put money away in good times in order to look after themselves later. I suggest that a decent IED scheme, whereby people can put money away in good times in order to look after themselves in bad times, is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I notice that the Council approved the awarding of the 1991 McKell Medal to Professor John Burton. Professor Burton from New England University, whom I have had a lot to do with, is an absolute genius at spreading the word about the conservation of our most precious resource. He is a person with practical ideas who did a great deal of good in the Murray-Darling Basin, as well as in the area of soil conservation generally. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity of following my colleague Senator Brownhill in speaking to the report of the Australian Soil Conservation Council on its meeting held in Sydney in August. In doing so, I first want to congratulate all of those throughout the Australian community who are making strenuous efforts to promote soil conservation activities across Australia. I note from the agenda that item No. 1 was, `The Decade of Landcare Plans and Commonwealth/State/Territory Cooperation'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, we have often heard of several pressing environmental matters, including energy, pollution and the greenhouse effect, which have been competing for the public's attention. But soil degradation is our most basic issue. It is often forgotten in the media and there do not seem to be many votes in this issue when politicians parade their concerns about the environment before the public. Yet, as I have said, soil degradation is Australia's No. 1 environmental issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over thousands of years, floods, dry spells and the prevailing wind patterns have combined to strip numerous layers of the fine fertile soil from Australia's surface. Regrettably, most of it has ended up in the Pacific and Indian oceans, stretching out from the coastline in two plumes to the north-west and the south-east, mirroring the prevailing wind systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all would have read numerous stories about wind-blown soil from the Australian mainland which is regularly dumped on the New Zealand alps. Nothing is more important to a nation's environment than its soil and the preservation of the quality of its land. The loss of our thin and fragile soil, the progressive degradation of our land and the expansion of the desert and arid areas of the Australian continent are our No. 1 environmental challenge. Left unmet, the result will be a disaster on a massive scale for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1983, about 66 per cent of all of our land was in need of some conservation measures. Significant long term problems have also arisen as a result of the progressive breaking down of the structure of Australian soils. Soil conservation is not only of particular importance to the greenies to whom the Government and the media are often pandering but also of vital importance to those Australians who often have much more to do with the environment&mdash;that is, the man and woman on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only in the past few years has soil degradation come a little into focus. This is partly because during the past few years Australia has experienced a series of storms, droughts and floods which were directly or indirectly related to the problem. Indeed, the disastrous drought currently being experienced in my State of Queensland has resulted in unheard of dust storms blanketing cities, such as Brisbane, with a constant haze of fine soil swept off the once beautiful top soil of the Darling Downs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation's stocktaking during the Bicentenary also brought a reawakening of concern for what has been happening to Australia's land. It is estimated that about half of Australia's rural land requires treatment for land degradation. Human activity has been responsible for about half of that degradation. Indeed, Australian farmers play the leading role in the environment, caring for over 200 million animals and millions of square kilometres of land. The care of this nation's environment, to a remarkable degree, is already in their hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agriculture is a sustainable and renewable industry, yet there is growing criticism, much of it from ignorance, of farming practices. Indeed, in previous reports on soil conservation it has been noted that although the rural recession has reduced the scale of soil conservation work it has not reduced landholders' commitment to land care. That is because farming is very much a family activity with a number of generations usually working the same farm. Consequently, there is a powerful incentive for each generation to leave the land in a better state than they found it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of farmers have, for decades, been environmentally conscious and have taken many initiatives to improve the environment. I have spoken in the Senate of the fine work done by many in the community on land care programs. I note in the report that the Chairman urged all Ministers to take a strong personal interest in the promotion and implementation of the decade of land care plans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion that the Senate take note of the Australian Soil Conservation Council's annual report, record and resolutions at its meeting held in Sydney in August. Although it is a strange coincidence, the aspects of the Chairman's opening statement which attracted Senator Brownhill's attention were the very ones that I had underlined as being particularly important. I noted also that the Chairman, in his opening statement, said that there was now a clear vision to guide our future efforts. The opening statement says that we will have `sustainable land use by the year 2000'. That has become the sort of statement that is very easily supportable by a number of commentators and people who are interested in this issue. The question becomes: what does it actually mean? Why is it important to make such a statement?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be considerable debate over the very meaning of the statement. In this context, I assume that it would be easy to gain agreement with the idea that sustainable land use would mean land use which could continue in that fashion infinitely. After all, there is no point in saying `sustainable' if we only mean sustainable up to a certain year&mdash;whether that be 3000 or 4000 AD. `Sustainable' must mean sustainable in an infinite sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Bjelke-Petersen adequately described to us why it was important that such a concept be cemented in our policies, in our Government's policies and in our community's actions over the next few years. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen quite rightly said, we are all too familiar with the mental picture, the tangible picture, of much of our soil being blown offshore into the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean or being deposited on New Zealand's alps. It is sad that we should be familiar with that picture. I think we have lost our complacency with that picture, but it is through actions of councils such as the Australia Soil Conservation Council that we have the means to stop that situation from recurring. Such a picture is not sustainable. It should be obvious to everybody that such a situation cannot continue indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the opening statement which attracted my attention, and that of Senator Brownhill, was that community land care continued to be the main focus of a tangent for governments in facilitating more sustainable land uses. The word `community' attracted me. As Senator Brownhill said, guidance, leadership and finance from the Commonwealth are necessary in this area. One of the most useful ways to ensure that it occurs is to emphasise and make available successful models of farm practice to those who use the land and those who devise policies about land use. Successful usage models must be available for inspection, instruction and education. It is not simply a matter of throwing money in that direction; it is a matter of following good examples&mdash;best practices, if you like&mdash;and certainly examples that are working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that we have a great number of successful land users around Australia. Those people have been able to demonstrate that their land use practices are sustainable and in fact are improving the soil retention of the areas in which they are involved. Such people do not receive enough publicity. I have mentioned in this place before Mr Bert Farquhar who has taken over an area of land known as Rushy Lagoon in Tasmania, an area previously owned and exploited by the British Tobacco Co. which degraded the soil very successfully. Since Mr Bert Farquhar and his army of unpaid workers&mdash;the worms&mdash;inhabited this land, it has become a model for all to follow. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>In the brief time available to me, I want to make a few points about the Industry Commission's annual report for 1990-91. It is a very important report and deserves detailed consideration by the Senate and, indeed, by the wider community. First, I congratulate Mr Stephen Sedgwick on his appointment as Chairman of the Industry Commission, following the appointment of the outgoing Chairman, Mr Tony Cole, as the Secretary to the Treasury. Mr Cole did a very good job with the Industry Commission. I wish Mr Sedgwick well in his new role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990-91 report raises some very important issues. It is in many ways a very thinly disguised attack and certainly a very strong criticism of the Government's performance in terms of economic reform in this country. At a time when economic reform is the buzz word for everyone, when the Government has been claiming great success in economic reform, the Industry Commission has brought that down to earth with a very significant bang. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report starts off by mentioning substantial progress in reforming Australia's economy in the past year. It mentions two reforms in particular: further tariff reductions and the States' acceptance in principle of mutual recognition of regulations. It also points out that governments have signalled a willingness to work together to effect further change in the context of the special Premiers conferences. So far as tariff reform is concerned, the coalition's policies for tariff reform would see a faster pace of reform than those of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this report was drafted, we have had the massive collapse of the special Premiers conference arrangements that showed so much hope of achieving substantial reform in Commonwealth-State relations, particularly so far as the financial relationship is concerned. The unwillingness of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), due to pressures from within his own Government, to encompass the scope for financial relationship change, despite previous commitments to the Premiers, is a very sad thing indeed and we will pay dearly for it. I hope very much that the Prime Minister will be able to change his view on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . some opportunities for micro-economic reform have not been taken up, even though the need to press ahead remains as urgent as ever. Not to respond to the challenge would be to condemn Australians to a lower standard of living than we are capable of achieving.</PARA>
<PARA>The report then talks about the missed opportunities that have occurred with this Government's policies. It mentions the fact that there is no room for complacency, that there is a great deal more still to be done. I note in particular page 5 of the report which is, as I said earlier, a thinly disguised but nevertheless strong criticism of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the thrust of the report as a whole is that the changes that this country ought to be making in the areas of micro-economic reform and our taxation system and the like are lineball with the thrust of many, and indeed most, of the specific proposals contained in the coalition's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document which was released last week.

<PARA>The annual report of the Commonwealth Bank for 1991 is indeed a very important report, as is said at the outset in the report itself. Indeed, the first sentence of the Chairman's report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The year ended June 1991 was a landmark year for the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>It certainly was a landmark year. The biggest landmark of it was the fact that 30 per cent of the shareholding of the Commonwealth Bank was floated on the public market and, as a result, we have a partial privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank for the first time. It is now owned 30 per cent by the public and 70 per cent by the Government. The Commonwealth Bank ought to have been fully privatised. It is a key plank of the coalition's policy that on coming to Government we will privatise the remaining 70 per cent of the shareholding of the Commonwealth Bank. As we pointed out in our coalition policy document last week, we propose to do that in the first year of returning to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is regrettable, I think, that only 30 per cent of the bank has been privatised to date. That was due to a large degree of internal pressure within the Labor Party ranks themselves. A special national conference of the Labor Party was required even to get approval for that 30 per cent to be privatised. The legislation enshrines the fact that the shareholding shall not increase beyond 30 per cent. One of the very first acts of the incoming Liberal-National government after the next election will be to amend that legislation to allow the bank to be fully privatised, because that is the only way in which we are going to enable the bank to grow, to achieve its own efficiency and to be able to compete properly in the financial markets along with the other private sector institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have a bank 30 per cent privatised and 70 per cent still in the hands of government hogties that institution in a way that makes it inevitable that it will not be able to be as efficient and as competitive as it should be, as the Government would want it to be, as the shareholders would want it to be and, indeed, as its customers would want it to be. The Commonwealth Bank is a major institution in Australia and it needs the ability to be able to compete fully and fiercely with all the other institutions that go to make up our financial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The annual report&mdash;I have had the chance to glance only very briefly at it&mdash;contains some very interesting material. In terms of the financial results for 1990-91, it points out that there was a significant fall in group operating profit after tax and before abnormal items from $497.3m in 1989-90 to $272.1m in 1990-91. That is a 45.3 per cent fall in profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That fall was due to a variety of factors, but in particular it was due to a massive rise in the charge against profit for bad and doubtful debt. That charge against profit for bad and doubtful debt rose during the year to a staggering figure of more than $1 billion. It had risen to $1.026 billion by the end of 1990-91. That is compared with a figure of only $461.7m at the end of 1989-90. That figure of $461m, for heaven's sake, was large enough. The rise to over $1 billion is a staggering increase. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bad debt expense adversely affected most areas of the Bank's operations. Profits of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Bank's finance company, CBFC Limited, both fell on this account.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Profit was also affected by loss of interest income and other revenues from non-performing loans. . .</PARA>
<PARA>This really is another phrase for bad debt. The report states that&mdash;net of provisions and interest reservations&mdash;those non-performing loans stood at a figure of $2.2 billion at 30 June 1991, compared with only $504m a year earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, over the 12 months from July 1990 to the end of June 1991, the non-performing loans of the Commonwealth Bank rose fourfold. They rose to a level of 3.09 per cent of the total lending assets of the bank, compared with less than one per cent of the lending assets a year earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures for 1990-91 were, of course, affected to a major degree by the other great event that occurred in connection with the Commonwealth Bank in 1990-91. I refer to its acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria which, the Senate will recall, arose as a bail-out operation because of the incredibly incompetent policies and mismanagement of the State Bank of Victoria, essentially by the Victorian Government, which led to the State of Victoria having to sell perhaps its prized asset, the State Bank, to the Commonwealth Bank. That was a bail-out operation of enormous magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The collapse of the State Bank of Victoria and the collapse of the Pyramid Building Society and other companies&mdash;including those connected with the Victorian Government's financing body, the VEDC&mdash;have had an enormous impact on my own State of Victoria. I see that my colleague Senator Cooney is here, not necessarily nodding his head but I am sure agreeing that the state of affairs in Victoria is one of very real depression. It is not just financial or physical depression and a loss in output but it is a major loss of will and spirit in Victoria. That is having a significant effect on the whole population of Victoria. There is a massive job to be done by incoming Liberal-National Party governments, both in Victoria and here in Canberra, to change that mood around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that without those changes in government there will not be the change in psychology in the Victorian community, business or individual, that is necessary if we are to get Victoria out of the dreadful hole that it is now in. The State Bank sale, I think at bargain prices, to the Commonwealth Bank was perhaps the classic example and epitome of everything that is wrong in the State of Victoria. </PARA>

That will continue for many years throughout this decade. All Victorians, every time they go to the petrol pump to put petrol in their cars, are paying 3c on every litre for the privilege of meeting the massive guarantees that were incurred as a result of what I believe was, to say the very least, the unbelievable incompetence that was exhibited by the Victorian Government&mdash;in particular, the incompetence exhibited by the then Treasurer, Mr Jolly, and the other responsible Minister, Mr McCutcheon, who gave to the depositors in Pyramid in the earlier part of last year a letter of comfort which was, at the very least, highly misleading. That is the basic reason why every Victorian is now shouldering the burden of the calamities that occurred with those building societies collapses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Commonwealth Bank, reflecting the impact on it of the finances of the State Bank of Victoria, is all part and parcel of a financial incompetence on the part of the Labor governments of Victoria and the Commonwealth.

They are a massive example of the reason why, at the next election, both in Victoria and federally, there will be, I am quite certain, a massive swing and a change of government in both the State and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other things one could say about the report. The report requires and warrants much more careful examination than we have been able to give it in the very short time since its release. But I congratulate the bank on getting through the year in the way in which it has. It has a very long, hard road ahead of it. To give the bank credit, it does not pull any punches when it looks at that road ahead. In the section on the outlook for 1991-92, the chairman, Mr Besley, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Weak domestic economic activity and depressed world market prices for some key Australian exports are expected to limit opportunities during the coming year and intensify competition amongst the banks for quality lending. . . </PARA>

<PARA>That is precisely what the Opposition here in Canberra has been telling the Government. If it thinks that economic recovery is under way, it is not only kidding itself but it is cruelly deluding itself and the Australian people. There is no way that the Australian economy at the moment has any recovery under way. At the very best one could say that the level of economic activity has bottomed. Even that, I believe, is optimistic and we as Australians are set for a very long, hard year ahead. The great tragedy about the continuation of this Government is that it is refusing to acknowledge those basic facts&mdash;that the fundamentals underpinning the Australian economy are in their worst shape for at least 60 years. Never since the 1930s has the fundamental structure of the Australian economy been in as weak a shape as it is today. Therefore, it is an absolute necessity to make a major and urgent start on correcting those fundamental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy that we face is that the Hawke Government seems to be unaware of what is happening and appears to be incapable of taking steps to start putting Australia back on the right road. The Government is so divided by leadership struggles, personality clashes, policy clashes and factional clashes that it has become a battle for survival of one job in Australia, and that is the job of the Prime Minister. At the same time as all this is happening, Australia has almost a million people who are unemployed and another 500,000-plus who are severely underemployed in this country. While that tragedy and human misery occur, we have a government&mdash;a so-called government&mdash;here in Canberra that can do nothing other than squabble and divide over the prime ministership. That is an indictment that will haunt this Hawke Labor Government for many years to come. Certainly it will haunt the Australian community because the Australian community is paying for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleague Senator Short in welcoming the annual report of the Commonwealth Bank. Very briefly, I want to make a few remarks about the state of the economy as outlined in the judgment of the Commonwealth Bank in its report. As Senator Short said, the bank noted that weaknesses in the economy are still affecting borrowers and are expected to continue for some time. I stress that point because it appears to be in some conflict with the Government's quaintly optimistic view that, to quote from the employment statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of a couple of weeks ago, `everything is on track'. We are certainly not on track for any early recovery, according to the Commonwealth Bank, which goes on to say that the outlook continues to be very uncertain. The report further states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Domestic production will need to outstrip domestic demand for some time if Australia is to overcome its balance of payments difficulties and enjoy sustainable economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the Government doing to create the requirement that domestic production will need to outstrip domestic demand which the bank says must happen? What is the Government doing to bring that about? We asked that question, in a way, at Question Time. We asked Senator Button what the Government was doing to restore full employment in Australia. The answer was nothing; in fact, there was no answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this question has to be answered and the Commonwealth Bank's concerns must be met. One reason the Opposition has introduced a program of total reform of the financial and tax systems is to bring about this result that the bank says is necessary. We have a policy vacuum from those on the Government side, who are doing nothing except fighting amongst themselves about who should be the leader of the sinking ship. It is left to the Opposition to present the only policy options, the only policy alternatives, the only effective plan to meet the sorts of requirements that the Commonwealth Bank says must be met if we are to get out of our present economic crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank notes that we will have continuing unemployment, which will be a restraining factor in any signs of recovery that might emerge in such sectors as the housing sector. That is the Commonwealth Bank's judgment. What is the Government doing about that? It has no policies but, rather, a policy vacuum. That is one reason why the John Hewson-Tim Fischer policy of total reform in the coalition's Fightback program is to get rid of seven hidden Hawke taxes, which are inhibiting economic growth and development and having such a damaging impact on the prospects of economic recovery, and to replace them with one fair, honourable and evident tax. The Commonwealth Bank report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The upturn in economic activity is likely to be more gradual than in previous recoveries.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very pleasant way of saying that there will be no early recovery and that, when recovery does occur, it will be slow and hard and we will not have anything like the levels of recoveries in the past, largely because this Government has no way out and is offering no hope. That is one of the marvellous things that the Hewson-Fisher package&mdash;the coalition's Fightback package&mdash;does; it provides the only hope, because this Government is providing nothing. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business investment in plant and equipment is likely to be slower.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in terms of any kind of recovery. Yet it is business investment in plant and equipment that is the basis on which our hopes of increased job opportunities and increasing employment and economic recovery depend. As the bank says, this area is likely to be slower in its growth than other parts of economic recovery, which it underlines will be more gradual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can see how, in the vacuum of policy this Government has created because of its internal divisions, the coalition has provided a whole set of coherent answers while the Government has none. In fact, the Government even has no answers to the coalition's policy, which was released last Thursday. Apart from the Prime Minister making a silly statement about fuel tax that has now been established to be totally wrong, the Government has no answers to that policy. It has no answers to the problems facing Australia and, on top of that, it has no coherent answers to the coalition's statement. At least the Opposition has provided the prospect of a coherent, positive answer, giving hope to the people of Australia and meeting the requirements for recovery that the Commonwealth Bank quite rightly points out are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank once again warns that weaknesses in the economy are expected to continue for some time. There is one reservation on that point. The economy will continue to be weak as long as this Government is in power. What is needed is a government that will give the Opposition's Fightback policies a go because they will give Australians a go. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I will be very brief. The Auditor-General's Report No. 12 should give no-one any pleasure because it is highly critical of a department that has a very important role to play at a time of massive unemployment. The Department of Employment, Education and Training, following the employment statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a couple of weeks ago, is now involved in a very important activity at a time when there are no jobs; that is, transforming undereducated dole queues into educated dole queues. That is an important task because, even though in the short run it may not do the young people of Australia much good, in the long run it may well increase their options in the job market, if and when this Government ever manages to have any policies that will create any real jobs. The employment statement of two weeks ago failed to do so. It is very depressing that when one reads this report one finds these conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO found that overall, management of IT in DEET had not been effective.</PARA>
<PARA>As these departments get more and more sophisticated in their requirements, there is a massive need for up to date information technology if they are to do their jobs properly. So the Auditor-General finds that management of this vital element of the Department's activities has not been effective. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">during its initial two and a half years, DEET had no senior management committee to plan and set priorities for the use of information technology&mdash;the transfer of computer operations from Melbourne to Canberra jeopardised the effective operation of information technology services in DEET when 95% of the technical computing staff in Melbourne left the Department</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an unsuccessful attempt to acquire a human resource management system resulted in a substantial waste of public money, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">parliamentary oversight of DEET's management of information technology had been hindered by excessive delay in responding to recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET's experience suggests that agencies in planning and giving advice to Government on new policies or operational arrangements, must take account of the impact of proposals on existing Government information systems.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the report does say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO acknowledges the very great difficulties that have confronted DEET as a new organisation in amalgamating several Government agencies and establishing an effective corporate IT management process.</PARA>
<PARA>All those separate matters are of some significance and indicate failures of management within that Department. Presumably those are failures that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) should have known about and taken action on. If he did not know about them, he has clear failings as a Minister, because this has been going on for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in September 1985, the Auditor-General levelled some major criticisms at the adequacy of planning, cost-benefit analysis and management of the development of the Job Bank system in this Department's predecessor. In particular, organisational and management infrastructure required to support the application of information technology in the Department was, according to the Auditor-General, undeveloped and inadequate. The Auditor-General's report of 1989-90 reported that early administration of the Austudy program involved a major imbalance acting against taxpayers' interests. So there was nothing unexpected about the fact that there were problems in this area. What did the Government do about it? The answer is: absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Job Seeker project, which was published in June 1986, was followed by a delay of more than three years before the Finance minute containing responses from the Department, from the Department of Finance and from the Department of Administrative Services was published in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report of November 1989. The Audit Office considers that the delay impeded parliamentary oversight of administrative performance. So back in 1989 we had more examples of bad management. Of course, this situation went on. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see what has occurred when we look at the transfer of the computer systems for this Department from Melbourne to Canberra. The Auditor-General says of this great move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the original objective of achieving efficiency through the consolidation of functions and accommodation in a single building in Canberra remains to be achieved. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the relocation of the Systems Division and the Melbourne computer centre severely disrupted the planning and management of information technology in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The staffing of the Systems Division was fundamentally affected by the relocation; only 12 of the 213 Systems Division staff in Melbourne accepted a transfer to Canberra. One result of the loss of staff was the suspension of some elements of basic management functions including strategic and implementation planning.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . despite the extensive use of contract staff, many functions essential&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not just important&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the effective management and operation of DEET's IT systems have not, and could not, be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General concludes on this area that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Department was without appropriate and sufficient resources for a considerable period and was unable to give adequate attention to planning, organisation development and other essential but long range management tasks.</PARA>
<PARA>The extraordinary thing about this is that this movement took place despite the recommendations of a committee, which was supposed to supervise this and make recommendations, that further consideration be given to the question of the location of the computer centre, taking into account any decisions made in relation to the Department's information technology strategic plan before the move took place. Nevertheless, as the Auditor-General notes, the transfer proceeded before the Department had sufficient opportunity to settle its strategic requirements. The key point, as the report states, is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that there was no technical requirement for the immediate relocation of computer operations even if the remainder of the Department was relocated to Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>This was just one of a great host of ludicrous decisions, because it was estimated overall that about one-third of the staff would transfer to Canberra, which was totally contrary to a survey conducted by the relevant staff association which indicated that 91 per cent would not transfer and 4 per cent were uncertain that they would transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this decimation of skill and an inability to implement the requirements of the move, leaving the Department in absolute chaos. As a result, the planning process of the Department had not ensured adequate coordination between the plans of program managers and the plans of the systems division. There were totally wrong estimates of costs of doing a whole range of things. The Audit Office concluded that there was reasonable evidence that the implementation of modes of devolved management in the Department had not proceeded with full regard to the requirements of the efficient overall planning and provision of information technology services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all these problems, we then find more evidence of mismanagement. In January 1990, the Department had to suspend the acquisition of a human resource management system called PRISM. The acquisition was to involve three separate but interdependent contracts for the supply of software products, but this had to be suspended when the combination of products could not be made operational. There is some terrific, effective, efficient bureaucratic bungling. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acquisition was suspended after an endeavour spanning three and a half years, the expenditure of $475,000 in software licence fees, additional contractual obligations of an uncertain amount but possibly amounting to $140,000, and the costs of departmental staff who were engaged in the project.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General did not estimate the costs of departmental staff. So here we have at least $600,000 in wasted money because this Department could not proceed with a computer acquisition because it simply would not work. As the Auditor-General reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acquisition was eventually frustrated through a technical failure.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not clear to the Auditor-General that the risks associated with using this system in the Department's technical environment were thoroughly appraised when the decision was taken to use the combination of these three separate but interdependent systems&mdash;PRISM, PICK and VM. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tender evaluation report was deficient to the extent that it did not indicate that the implementation of PRISM would need to be carefully managed to minimise the risks inherent in using several technologies which were new to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>Contributing technical risks were that the proposed combination was outside the Department's technical strategy; the combination was unproven; and, in any event, the Department had lost most of its technical staff because of the move from Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this there was a whole range of different people on the purchasing side, along with a whole range of different people on the suppliers side. The Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the circumstances the risk of an unsatisfactory outcome was increased by the difficulty of achieving co-ordinated action by all the parties.</PARA>
<PARA>Amongst the suppliers there was no prime contractor to accept the overall responsibility for providing a fully operable combination of products which satisfied DEET's requirements. But it gets even worse. A failure to finalise the contract with Panache, one of the companies involved, before proceeding to accept services from that contractor left the particular obligations of each party uncertain, especially in the event that one or other of the contractors failed to perform its contractual obligation. So here we have disaster on top of disaster. There was not a proper contract that was properly signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Department was aware, according to the Auditor-General, of the need to draft contracts in such a way as to deal with non-performance or delayed performance, delay in concluding the contracts with the several parties created a situation in which the Commonwealth's interests were not protected. The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the incompleteness of certain aspects of the contract can create uncertainty about the rights and obligations of the parties.</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office noted that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts had already criticised this kind of behaviour where there had been the proceeding with complex computer acquisitions before the completion of formal contracts. That had been criticised on the Jobseeker acquisition. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO concluded that the selection of PRISM would have been justified had the technical risks which flowed from the use of new technologies been recognised and managed appropriately. The ANAO formed the view that the risks may have been managed more successfully if the transfer of Systems Division functions from Melbourne, and the urgency with which the Management Division pursued implementation of PRISM, had not combined to diminish the involvement of the Systems Division in the later stages of the acquisition of implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General now recommends that various action be taken so that this sort of thing does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that the Department of Administrative Services has advised that the failure of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to achieve successful operations of the PRISM package was not unique. It goes on to say that the introduction of such packages into the Public Service had produced other similar results. It gets worse and worse. The Audit Office now says that, where a contract is of such value or complexity that the requisitioning agency prepares written specifications and requires interested suppliers to present comprehensive written tenders or expressions of interest, a complete written agreement should be concluded before the acquisition proceeds. Is it not incredible that the Auditor-General has to say that one has to sign a contract before paying for or having the goods delivered and that it is a good idea to sign a contract first? One would think that the Auditor-General would not have to tell any government that is the basic way to do business. But this Government and this Department have to be told by the Auditor-General that they had better do that sort of thing, which is a basic requirement of people conducting normal business activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all in all, it is a pretty depressing report from the Auditor-General. It is a pretty depressing comment on the competence of the management of the Minister in this Department and, I might say, a pretty damaging comment about the ability of this Government's Ministers to know what is going on in their own departments. That lack of ability may explain why this Government is making such a mess of the whole economy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Securities Commission took over the role of Australia's corporate regulator in January of this year from the NCSC. The ASC was designed to be a more effective regulator. It is better funded, is designed to be more responsive to the needs of the business community, is designed to be more directly accountable to this Parliament&mdash;hence the setting up of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities from which, of course, this is the first report&mdash;and is designed to have a more uniform approach to corporate law with Australia-wide powers. To give effect to these expectations, the ASC was given, in the words of the former Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, `strengthened inspection and investigation powers compared with those of the NCSC'. These included the power to hold hearings and to gather information on the conduct of companies and securities transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In granting these powers the legislation prevents the answers to questions at a hearing, the fact of the production of a document, or `any information, document or other thing' gathered as a result of those answers&mdash;that is, material derived from those answers&mdash;being admissible in any subsequent prosecution of the person being questioned. This derivative use immunity, as it is referred to, represents an extension of the protection offered to witnesses before ASC inquiries when one compares this with similar provisions in the old Companies Code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions in a joint submission to the inquiry argued that this derivative use immunity effectively renders its investigative powers worthless where criminal prosecutions are contemplated. One of the witnesses described the ASC's investigating powers under the current law as `a poisoned chalice&mdash;since you get the investigative power and if you use it you kill off your ability to bring a criminal action in some cases'. The problem was anticipated in evidence before the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation by the NCSC. The NCSC said at that time that section 68(3)&mdash;which is one of the sections that we are addressing in this report&mdash;`will make the compulsive powers of the ASC virtually useless'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of their experience of working with the new law over the past year, the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions have recommended that corporations law and the ASC law be amended to remove the derivative use immunity and the use immunity relating to the production of a document. This is essentially a return to the status quo ante. It would, in effect, restore the level of protection provided by the old Companies Code. There is nothing unique about that. The tax Act at section 264 and the Trade Practices Act at section 155(7) removed the right to silence and in return provided limited indemnity but not derivative use immunity. If this change being proposed by the DPP and the ASC and supported by the Committee were adopted, answers to questions would be inadmissible where the witness claimed the privilege against self-incrimination before answering. However, derivative information gathered as a result of those answers would be admissible in a criminal prosecution of the person giving the answers, as would any documents provided by that person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee had to strike a balance between two competing public interests. On the one hand, there is the need to have a properly regulated corporate sector in which both investors and the community can have confidence and, on the other, the preservation of the established common law right against self-incrimination. It is the view of the majority of the Committee that that balance should be struck in favour of effective enforcement of the law and, thus, we have recommended in favour of the ASC-DPP proposals. Our reasons for reaching this conclusion relate principally to the nature of corporate crime and the special difficulties it poses for law enforcement. But they relate, secondly, to what we see as the importance of successful criminal prosecutions, for the standing of the ASC and for the consequent standing of the business community resulting from these prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporations are legally privileged entities created by statute. They benefit from limited liability and the right to raise funds from the public. That privileged position carries with it obligations which may involve curtailing some of the rights of those who benefit from it. Mr Justice Rodgers, the Chief Justice of the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, recently argued that the obligation extends to explaining:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">what happened, why it happened, what was done by the executives in carrying on the business, even if the disclosures mean that civil or criminal liability may be proved against the person. . . Anyone who chooses to undertake the privileges of such office should be ready to explain the circumstances surrounding the discharge of statutory and fiduciary duties.</PARA>
<PARA>Similar sentiments were expressed by the judge in the recent Guinness prosecution in the UK, which conviction was upheld on appeal. I will not quote the judgment in full because it is very lengthy, but I draw the attention of honourable senators to submission No. 9 to the inquiry by Mr Santow, which quotes parts of the judgment. It is a very compelling argument in explanation of why the law was changed in the UK in the way we are suggesting it should be changed in Australia. That same witness to the Committee, an experienced lawyer in private practice in Australia, described the unique features of corporate crime in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporate crime is unlike conventional crime in at least three respects:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the immediate victim, the company, is an inanimate legal fiction often controlled by the perpetrator at the time, unlike the human victim of theft. There is therefore typically no human victim with direct familiarity with the circumstances&mdash;so that the prosecution is forced to rely on the perpetrator for evidence, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) for this reason and because of the complexity of the facts, documentary evidence is essential. But it is only useful if it can be identified and explained by the perpetrator and by other enquiries yielding other evidence not precluded by derivative use immunity,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)unlike ordinary theft, the accused has generally exploited the privilege of carrying on business with limited liability using the public's money, either as a shareholder or creditor.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is sensitive to the need to preserve traditional rights and responsibilities. However, it is also aware that society has evolved in directions undreamt of when many of these traditional rights were established. The law is not static and immutable, as some would seem to claim that it is. It is dynamic. It must evolve and develop with changing circumstances or become impotent. This is something that is recognised both in the USA and in the UK where they deal with the matter in different ways, some of which we agree with and others with which, as I will show later, we do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second reason for recommending in favour of the ASC-DPP position is the perceived importance to the standing of the ASC and, as a consequence, of the business community of successful criminal prosecutions. There is little doubt that the public perception of the ASC as an effective corporate regulator will be greatly enhanced if successful prosecutions can be mounted against some of the more notable thieves of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a high public expectation of this. That is not to say that the main thrust of the ASC should not be civil. Nor is it to say that that is in fact the case. The internal briefings of the ASC make it very clear that its main thrust is civil, to try to protect the invested funds or the creditors' funds as a first move, but that if matters arising out of those investigations show that there has been criminal negligence criminal action should follow. It is not a primary action but a secondary or consequent one. But it is very important in terms of the standing of the ASC and the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one asks the average person in the street whether the much hallowed and, I must say, often overstated right against self-incrimination should be allowed to frustrate prosecutions against the crooks of the 1980s, the answer&mdash;whether one is in Pitt Street, Bourke Street or Hay Street in Perth&mdash;would be a very decisive no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of anger about the perception that these people are thumbing their noses at governments, at the courts and at the community; that they are living the same luxurious lifestyles that they were used to through their heydays in the 1980s, despite being bankrupt or technically bankrupt; or that they are escaping scrutiny altogether in secluded villas in Spain. There is a great deal of anger but, importantly, there is also, as a consequence, a lack of confidence in a system which allows this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is not unique to Australia. A reading of the Roskill committee report in the UK shows how closely the UK has been mirroring the sorts of concerns that we have had and what it has done about it. The report states in its introduction:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public no longer believes that the legal system in England and Wales is capable of bringing the perpetrators of serious frauds expeditiously and effectively to book. The overwhelming weight of the evidence laid before us suggests that the public is right. In relation to such crimes, and to the skilful and determined criminals who commit them, the present legal system is archaic, cumbersome and unreliable. At every stage, during investigation, preparation, committal, pre-trial review and trial, the present arrangements offer an open invitation to blatant delay and abuse. While petty frauds, clumsily committed, are likely to be detected and punished, it is all too likely that the largest and most cleverly executed crimes escape unpunished. The Government has encouraged and continues to encourage ordinary families to invest their savings in the equity markets, particularly in the equities of formerly state-owned enterprises. If the Government cherishes the vision of an `equity-owning democracy', then it also faces an inescapable duty to ensure that financial markets are honestly managed, and that transgressors in these markets are swiftly and effectively discovered, convicted and punished. Self-regulatory mechanisms designed to encourage honest practices are now coming into force. Where those mechanisms are abused, the law must deliver retribution, swift and sure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows that fundamental change is required in certain areas of the law.</PARA>
<PARA>That change has occurred in England and it has allowed prosecutions which have been thwarted here by the impediments to which this Committee report refers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also neither sensible nor realistic, as claimed in the minority report, to expect that derivative use immunity should have been tested before the courts before any change is recommended. For a start, a test case before the High Court is likely to take anything between three and five years&mdash;with my bet being closer to the five years than the three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of such a delay would be that the major players in the scams, the frauds and the thefts of the 1980s would get away scot-free. This would leave people wondering whether the ASC is capable of regulating the corporate sector. It does not matter how good the work it has done elsewhere, if it is not seen to have prosecuted some of these perceived criminals who are so prominently thumbing their noses at the courts, it will be judged harshly by the public. The law in these circumstances would be regarded correctly as an ass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the USA, where the right to silence is enshrined in the Constitution, the law has developed some interesting mechanisms to get around the problems posed in prosecuting corporate criminals. Racketeering legislation&mdash;the so-called RICO Act&mdash;involves the seizure of the total assets of the accused to compel plea bargaining. This was how the junk bond dealer, Michael Milliken, and others were convicted in recent cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the view of the majority of the Committee that properly regulated hearings in which evidence is gathered represents a far lesser threat to individual rights and liberties than the threat provided by such backdoor methods of prosecution. It needs to be borne in mind that ASC hearings are not, despite the views of some witnesses and some members of the Committee, star chamber investigations. Hearings under corporations law are conducted before courts at the request of the ASC and witnesses are protected by the procedures of the court. Hearings conducted by the ASC itself are also subject to strict controls. Participants may be legally represented. They are entitled to a fair warning of the hearing and of the matter under investigation, and there is a set of procedures produced by the ASC covering all of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A witness who is not satisfied that the ASC is conducting the hearing in accordance with its statutory responsibilities&mdash;or, for that matter, normally accepted practices&mdash;may refuse to cooperate. In the recent Titan Hills case, for example, representatives of a company under investigation were of the view that the notice requesting their attendance was inadequate and they simply refused to attend. The ASC then had to seek a court order compelling their attendance and the court sided with Titan Hills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be recognised that these examinations are not trials at which a person is being compelled to confess to some crime. They are information gathering exercises which may yield evidence admissible in court. The evidence is then open to challenge in the normal processes of the judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recognises the importance of these fundamental rights and does not believe they should be removed lightly. It does believe, however, that on balance there is a good case for returning to the protections afforded under the old Companies Code. In this regard, the argument put by some that perhaps the problem might be solved by the removal of the use immunity as it applies to documents is a nonsense, since the documents themselves are often useless unless their significance can be verified by verbal or other evidence which would still be subject to derivative use immunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommending the changes, the Committee will continue to monitor the ASC's use of its investigatory powers. It has also recommended that the proposed amendments include a sunset clause that will require positive action to confirm the amendments in the next Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of leaving legislation as it is, as some would have it, and of effectively relegating the ASC to civil redress cannot be accepted. As I have already indicated, it would mean that Parliament is washing its hands of the problem of community expectations with regard to the effectiveness of the ASC. It would mean that it is prepared to take a risk that the standing of the ASC and, as a consequence, of the business community, would be severely damaged. It would mean that, unlike the UK, the Australian Parliament refuses to recognise that there are fundamental differences between conventional crime and corporate crime. It would mean that the Parliament refuses to recognise that the law is a dynamic and changing thing and that it must evolve and develop if it is to remain viable and to win community respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes the checks and balances it has introduced will more than adequately protect people's rights and liberties in the light of the minor changes proposed. The Committee is in fact suggesting the very moderate step of returning to the situation which existed under the former Companies Code. In that context, I find it hard to understand why a minority report should have been necessary, although I guess I will very shortly find out why from Senator Cooney. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The challenge has been thrown out. We have been asked, `Why did the minority disagree?'. In answer, I say that, in my view, the right to silence, like a lot of other great principles of our law, is worth preserving. There is always a terrible temptation for government to rush in when it sees that there is a vice to be cured. Sometimes it does so in a way that puts at risk some of the great principles by which we live in a free and democratic society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give as an illustration&mdash;and I say this in a non-partisan way&mdash;what happened recently in Queensland where, because of a jury result in that State, there was a cry from government that the system should be at least examined, perhaps set aside and perhaps new rules brought in. That might seem all right to some people in respect of a particular case. But, overall, one has cause for concern once the principles upon which this society of ours depends start to be eroded. An erosion of a particular principle can then be used as a precedent for further erosions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that the precedents Senator Beahan quoted in support of a change to the common law respecting the right to silence were pieces of legislation passed through this Parliament. It concerns me that we as a parliament pass legislation to modify the traditional principles we live by and then use that legislation as a precedent for a further erosion of liberties. Five years down the track someone may come along and say, `We want to take away a process considered up to now to be proper for fair investigation'. If there is an objection to that, he or she will say, `Look, why do you object?  A similar thing was done five years ago'. So, there is a precedent established by  what  is  now  being  done  under protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Beahan is right&mdash;a balance must be struck between the public interest in protecting individual rights and the public interest in seeing that the good of the community is promoted. The majority of the members of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities have said that it is for the good of the community that people&mdash;not only in the corporate field but, I should imagine, generally&mdash;should act ethically and morally, and with skill and diligence. However, it is also good for the community that its members should be able to go about their business freely without being harassed by the state, without being unduly suppressed by government and without being watched by a regime that is a shadow&mdash;no matter how pale it may be&mdash;of that described so well by George Orwell in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1984</EMPHASIS>. I do not suggest for one minute that that is what is happening here. But I do say that one of the central features of the work of Orwell was that people could be questioned under duress&mdash;although I am not suggesting that that is the same sort of duress that is suggested in the present circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the interests of our great traditions that I opted in this case to adhere to the right to silence. I come back to this point because I think it is interesting: the only precedent that can be quoted for a breach of the right to silence is the precedent that this Parliament itself has set in respect of the cooperative scheme with the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If corporate crime is so bad in the sense that it brings about bad results for the economy, that somehow it diminishes the corporate sector and that somehow companies are now faced with ruin or at least with a diminution of fortune, people in this chamber have been very quiet about it. We on this side tend to blame the Opposition for our economic problems; the Opposition is constantly on the attack, saying that it is the Government's fault. I rely on such people as Senator Baume to correct me but even in its new document I do not think the coalition has alleged that corporate crime has brought about our present economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is stated in the report that the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Securities Commissioner find that they have difficulty in proceeding against wrongdoers. Of course they would say that. We would all like to see our jobs made easier. But where is the compelling evidence that we can look to and say, `Here is a course of conduct; here is a series of illustrations of where the present law has not produced a proper result'? If we are going to make a dramatic change in the law&mdash;and that is what we are doing here&mdash;should we not be blessed with some sort of compelling evidence to show that the perpetrators of corporate crime have so shaken the economy as to make it necessary to surrender traditional rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of evidence to the contrary that has to be taken into account. In that context, I would like to quote from an article by Mr John Coldrey, as he then was, Mr Justice Coldrey of the Supreme Court of Victoria, as he is now. When he was Director of Public Prosecutions in Melbourne, he had this to say about the right to silence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly speaking, this right has been recognised by the common law since the end of the 17th Century. For the past 300 years it has formed an integral part of the English criminal justice system and those that are based upon it. For much of those 300 years the concept has been criticised, yet it has survived and still has widespread support today. It is not unreasonable therefore to cast upon those who seek its abolition (or at least its curtailment) the onus of justifying the necessity for change.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not too sure that one can justify throwing aside 300 years of tradition by saying that people in the streets are very unhappy about how corporate criminals go about their business and that the people are baying for blood. If we are going to satisfy everybody's lust for blood, where will we be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an increase in the sorts of powers we give to investigative bodies such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales and the National Crime Authority. We load investigative authorities with more and more powers to tap telephones, for example. Where does it stop? It creates a quite unsavoury mood and, as I said before, recent events in Queensland are an illustration of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that has to be remembered is that people say, `Corporate crime is very bad; therefore we will change the law in respect of it. It is a crime that is different from other sorts of crime; therefore we will deal differently with it'. But if we are talking about how people in the street react to crime, what about a ghastly murder or an act of incest or a dreadful rape or a kidnapping or an awful burglary? Why are those crimes of such a nature that they do not attract a change in the law, yet corporate crime in some way does? It is sought to distinguish that sort of crime by saying that it is more important to preserve the economic integrity of the community and to look after our international trade than it is to preserve the lives and reputations and bodily integrity of our citizens. That seems to me to be what is being said here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That proposition might cause some concern; but what causes even more concern is the fact that there is no compelling evidence that the proposition is correct. The National Crime Authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Securities Commission seem to be able, on the basis of the logic in this report, to come before a parliamentary committee and say, `We want more powers'; and we say, `Yes, very good; you can have the powers'. Let us hope that they do not come asking for too many more powers because we might become so supine that we will be willing to abolish not only the right to silence but also all those other protections that keep our society decent, free and fair, as it is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to silence can be easily set aside. Perhaps Senator Beahan might have given the example of what has happened in some trials in Northern Ireland, where a person's silence has been taken to be an admission of guilt. I happen to know that that sort of thing causes judges considerable concern. It was related to me that one judge in particular came to a conclusion of guilt on the basis that a person had stood mute, and that concerned him considerably. So it is not only the public generally but also the people who have to administer the law who are concerned by these sorts of erosions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is on the wing. I have put forward my proposition and I have criticised the majority for not adhering to our great principles as strongly as it might have done. In answer to the demands of the people in the street who, quite properly, want to see criminals gaoled and who do not like people who are in Spain and criminals elsewhere getting away with their misdeeds, apparently we are going to change ancient principles. Before we label people criminals, it would be good if we were to go through the proper process to prove them to be so. When propositions are made on the basis that people are criminals before the process is over and done with, it becomes a matter for concern. It is a little like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alice in Wonderland</EMPHASIS> trial, where the verdict comes first and the trial afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I add that this Committee is quite an outstanding one. I congratulate Senator Beahan, not on the result of the inquiry but on the way in which he has chaired the Committee. He has chaired it very well; it is a good Committee. I mention also Senator Lewis, who has been an able Deputy Chairman. The other members in this chamber are me, Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Sid Spindler. In the other House, the members are the Hon. Laurie Brereton and Mr Frank Ford, who is quite a genius because he agreed with me on this matter, as did Senator Campbell. That shows that there are people with great intellectual ability on this Committee. Other members are Mr Duncan Kerr, the Hon. John Moore and the Hon. Gary Punch. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I table the report of the parliamentary delegation to Ireland and the European institutions. It is with great pleasure that I bring to the Senate this report of the delegation. We had hoped to table it on Thursday last, but the great amount of business that was before the Senate meant that it was deferred until today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the presence in the gallery tonight of the Ambassador for Ireland, Mr Martin Burke, and the Charge d'Affaires for the European Communities, Mr Roderick Skinner. Right from the beginning, when the delegation from this Parliament was first nominated, they have taken a special interest in ensuring that we were well informed and that we had a good pathway to achieve our purposes in our visit to the European institutions and particularly to Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this report is unanimous. It represents the work of five members of the House of Representatives and three senators&mdash;Senator Harradine, Senator McKiernan and me. We found the delegation to be most productive and useful. Having been in this chamber for more than 13 years, I have been happy to be on many parliamentary delegations. This is the one that I have valued the most in that we achieved a very real increase in our personal knowledge of the parliamentary and government institutions in Europe. It was a perfect delight not only to do that in Ireland but also to enjoy the people and to build on the enormous warmth and common feeling, common knowledge and common heritage that we in Australia have with the people of Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is in five parts. The first part deals with our visit to Ireland. We were the guests of the Parliament in Dublin for eight days. We were received by parliamentarians in various parts of the countryside, as well as in the capital city. We were received by the government, a number of commercial and industrial bodies and the university. The second part of the report concerns the European Parliament; that is, the 12 nations represented in the Parliament in Strasbourg. The third part of the report deals with our visit to the Council of Europe, also in Strasbourg, which comprises 24 nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our fourth activity was to attend the Strasbourg Conference on Democracy where some 70 countries were represented. Hundreds of parliamentarians from around the world focused on democracy and how to promote it in the world; especially on our mind was eastern Europe and the recent changes there. We also looked at the Caribbean, Central America, Africa and Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth part of our report deals with our visit to Brussels where we went, as it were, to the government of Europe. We met with the European Commission and Council of Ministers and a number of other organisations. We had a full day with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. At this particular time NATO is redefining and giving a more current focus to its purposes and rationale now that we have seen the end of the Cold War. We had a number of other visits in Brussels of significance to us, such as to the Belgian Parliament. We also went to Ypres where at the Menin Gate we laid a wreath on behalf of Australians in memory of the 10,000 Australians who died during the First World War in that battlefield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to some of the conclusions that are set out in the report following the delegation's visit to these five areas of Europe. First, I note that, in my mind, there were really two purposes for the delegation. We refer to these at the beginning of our conclusions. These two purposes were to familiarise ourselves with the European parliamentary and government institutions so that as Australian parliamentarians we could add more detail and more directness  to our previous knowledge. For us, this was an invaluable gain. Fifteen per cent of Australia's exports go to Europe and we want to see that proportion increase. Europe is still the largest source of foreign investment in Australia. Of course, we have a huge cultural and linguistic heritage in common with Europe that leads us to have ready access to each other and to build. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second overriding purpose was for us, as Australian parliamentarians, to reinforce Australian views about our national interest in Europe. That focuses almost entirely&mdash;our resources were limited, given the time that we were there&mdash;on one issue; that is, to achieve our purposes in GATT and in the Uruguay Round; to see a freer world trading community, in particular where Europe and the United States both agree to lower their high tariff barriers to many of our products, particularly agricultural products. In focusing upon Europe, every day of our visit we made it very clear, particularly in debates in the chamber in Strasbourg, in our meeting with the Council of Ministers in Brussels and in other ways, that we want to see the end of the common agricultural policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say that, I am very aware that the policy was the foundation of the European Community; it led to its formation. One of the transitional commitments of the European nations was to have a common agricultural policy that would hold Europe together. That purpose has been achieved, and at last we are starting to see the Europeans themselves wanting to move on to enable, for their own advantage, the CAP to be replaced by a freer trade system. We are all holding our breath to see the outcome of the Uruguay Round, but I would like to think that our parliamentary delegation in Europe played its part in reinforcing what the Government, the Opposition and all of the industrial groups in Australia have been putting to the Europeans and to the Americans over many years now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe that we need to continue this pressure until we achieve our goal. Our first conclusion, set out on the introductory page v, is that we must maintain dialogue, we must be persuasive by showing the genuineness of our arguments. Without going over that here, I believe that there will be lower prices and lower taxes for Europeans as they move away from the common agricultural policy towards a freer trade situation. We need to reinforce that by every means possible, not only diplomatic, not only in terms of industrial meetings, but also by parliamentarians meeting with European parliamentarians and by our seeing European parliamentary delegations coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is with this in mind that the delegation recommends that the annual visits by Australian delegations be maintained and that, similarly, the frequency of delegations from the European Parliament also be maintained. We believe it is also important that persons such as the Agricultural Commissioner, Mr McSharry, be invited as official guests of the Australian Government to this country on a fact-finding basis to reinforce our arguments as to why the common agricultural policy needs to be abandoned in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Towards that end, let me say that I bring to the Senate's attention, if it is not already in the minds of senators present, a pamphlet entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Are You Paying Too Much? </EMPHASIS>which was released by the Australian Government while we were in Europe, and we saw something of its immediate impact. On behalf of the Opposition, I join the Government in supporting this document. The arguments it sets out fairly and squarely reveal factually to Europeans that they will pay lower prices and lower taxes if they allow freer trade such that our agricultural products can be sent to the European market. I do not have time to refer to the information in this pamphlet, so I ask leave of the Senate to table this document. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would also be better. We have to make that point to the Europeans. I am not calling for too rapid change or change that lacks compassion; there must be transitional arrangements. Fortunately, in Ireland for example, we saw some transitions. The service industry is growing in Dublin; accounting mechanisms are being very profitably based there; a tourist development is reviving an old mid-nineteenth century canal. In Europe, countries are finding the things that they are good at and doing them at international prices. No longer are we seeing Europeans squandering their own resources and the taxpayers' money by continuing with an outdated and counterproductive common agricultural policy. I recommend the bringing of displays of Australian produce to the market places of Europe&mdash;we refer to that in our recommendation&mdash;and the publishing of booklets such as the one that I have tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by referring to just three other matters briefly. With regard to Ireland, I could speak at length. I speak warmly about Ireland as a person who, although having a name common in Ireland, is of Cornish descent; my great grandfather came from Cornwall. Whilst there is this common Celtic link, I do not have the same direct Irish ancestry as, say, Senator McKiernan or Senator Harradine, who I hope will be speaking in just a few moments. Yet I went to Ireland with the feeling of all Australians that the Irish have had an enormous part in the building of Australia and have brought so much that is positive, including humour, humanity and a sense of fairness that I really warm to. I can become very emotional, particularly when some of those themes are included in an Irish song and there is a bit of Murphy's about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to one particular serious and topical matter, and that is the International Fund for Ireland. One of the tasks we set ourselves was to gain some first-hand knowledge of this fund and how it operates. The United Kingdom and the United States, with Ireland, have been big contributors to the fund. Up to this point, Australia has not contributed. The delegation has unanimously concluded that it is a sound project that we ought to contribute towards. I just read the report's conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation therefore recommends that the government commences negotiations with the UK and Irish governments with a view to making a contribution to the International Fund for Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA>I finally refer to the Strasbourg Conference on Democracy and to the scrutiny of multilateral organisations. With regard to democracy, I remain, as an Australian parliamentarian, excited about democracy. I believe that it is the determination of free peoples that leads to the best government and the most prosperity for those peoples. Indeed, it leads to the best peace in the world. A former member of the House of Representatives, Dr Klugman, once put forward the thesis that no democracies had gone to war. I support democracy for all sorts of positive reasons, such as those to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Conference on Democracy that was initiated by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg has had several meetings now. There is a call for a meeting to be held in Asia and for us to focus upon what we can contribute to enhancing democracy in the countries of Asia. It was a request put to us in the delegation that Australia consider hosting such a conference. We have recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .subject to the satisfactory resolution of funding arrangements, the Presiding Officers give consideration to hosting the first Asian/Pacific Regional Colloquy Conference on Democracy to be held in October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>The last point to which I refer is the parliamentary scrutiny of multilateral aid organisations. We took part in a debate on the floor of the chamber in Strasbourg along with all the Europeans, the 24 nations, in an examination of the OECD annual report. The Secretary General, Mr Claude Paye, was present and gave a speech. We asked questions of him. It was a very mild and introductory form of a Senate Estimates committee, but it was one where many nations' parliamentarians were examining on an annual basis an important report of an important body&mdash;the OECD. I believe that we ought to see more of that and that we ought to see that applied to the World Bank, to the International Monetary Fund and to the principal programs of the United Nations, such as UNDP. I believe that there are ways to do this. I set out this matter in more detail in a paper I gave 10 days ago here in Canberra to the annual forum of AIDAB. I ask leave to table that paper. </PARA>

It was a pleasure to travel with all of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I give notice that in the coming week I will refer to the opportunity I had on my way to join the delegation to visit Turkey where I was able to follow up a number of matters with the government there and to visit Gallipoli. I also had the opportunity on my return trip to Australia to make a personal visit to the United Kingdom, to spend four days in Moscow&mdash;with a similar agenda to that of the Foreign Minister during his visit last week&mdash;and then to visit Mongolia and Beijing. These visits, which were valuable to me personally, were made possible by being a member of the delegation to Europe. I thank all those people associated with the delegation's work. I thoroughly commend our report to the Senate and to the nation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I claim the privilege of being the only Irish born member currently serving in this Parliament. Certainly, I am not the first who has ever served in it. It is with a great deal of pride that I continue to claim that privilege. Although a colleague in the other place has an accent that is quite similar to mine in Australian terms, it is distinctly different in Irish terms. I refer to my colleague Ted Grace, whose mother had the unfortunate experience of giving birth to him while she was briefly in the country of Wales. Nonetheless, I think Ted, for the purposes of the debate here tonight, is as Irish as I am. I have made a point of making these comments at the start of my speech. I want to go on to make some mention of the Irish contribution to this great and wonderful country&mdash;this land of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking back over the four weeks the delegation was in Ireland and in Europe, it is very difficult to select highlights. Certainly, there was lots and lots of hard work, with some days stretching for as long as perhaps some sittings of the Senate&mdash;starting early in the morning and concluding rather late at night. However, I assure honourable senators that we did not touch the Murphy's until after the bells had rung. We certainly had some opportunities to join with our parliamentary colleagues from other parts of the world and to share experiences on a whole range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Highlights that spring to mind include the visit to the magnificent parliamentary chamber of the European Parliament where we participated to some degree in some very crucial and important debates of the times and, unfortunately, some debates about issues that continue to this very day. I am talking about the great difficulties in Yugoslavia, Croatia and Slovenia. That visit was certainly a highlight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation headquarters, where we had some very useful and intense discussions with senior officers of that organisation. NATO played a crucial role in the Gulf conflict in which Australia was involved earlier this year. I make the point in passing that it seemed easier to get into the NATO premises, high security as they may be, than sometimes it seems to be to get into this place. That is perhaps a credit to the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very moving experience for me was our visit to war graves in Flanders. With the memories of the Gulf war very fresh in our minds, having participated in the debates which I mentioned earlier, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>it was really a sad reflection on humankind when one looked around at the headstones, all similar and all identifying young men and women cut down in the prime of life while fighting in a war. It certainly brought home the message that peace ought to be predominant in all our minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it was a very moving experience to identify the graves of people from one's home State&mdash;as indeed did every member of the delegation. We also visited the Menin Gate memorial, which is literally covered with the names of young Australians who gave their lives, in what some of us now believe was a needless conflict that should not have happened. On one of our leisure days we visited a former concentration camp which has been preserved to remind each and every one of us of man's inhumanity to man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Teague said, we participated in a conference on democracy. Some 400 politicians from 70 nations talked about that most cherished possession, parliamentary democracy&mdash;something that we do indeed cherish in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the major highlights, perhaps we could talk about our discussions with senior politicians and dignitaries in the different nations. But coming down more to earth, from my own personal point of view one of the most moving experiences was visiting a farm in Ireland. We met an Irish family, the Ryan family, at Rathcannon in County Tipperary. We were not only given a real life experience of what agriculture is like&mdash;Ireland is indeed an agricultural country&mdash;but also shown what life is like for a typical Irish family. The whole of the delegation is grateful for the hospitality that was given to us by the Ryan family on that morning when we visited them in Tipperary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine may want to say something more about Tipperary because he was supporting that county in the all-Ireland hurling final which took place on the first day of the delegation's visit. He bought a hat in the Tipperary colours before the game and he supported what turned out to be the winning side. I will not steal his thunder but will let him beat his own drum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I was unable to be part of the delegation's visit to that magnificent Irish occasion, the all-Ireland hurling final. My son, in his wisdom, decided to get married to his wonderful wife, Sandy, the day before the delegation left, so I had to delay my departure for one day. It just shows the choices that politicians sometimes have to make. In the interests of family life, I believe that I made the right decision, although when I woke up on the morning after the wedding I was not quite so sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second farm that we visited was in Belgium. Again the family on the farm bestowed real and meaningful hospitality upon us. They made us feel welcome on a European autumn morning. We had to rise very early in the morning, and I put on record my thanks to the delegation secretary for getting me out of bed because I had had a late night the night before. He made sure that I joined the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation on its last day in Europe visited the farm of Mr Van Acker. We participated to some degree in his farming duties and we experienced what life is really like for a European farmer. Life on a farm in Europe is not just a comfortable cushion, despite all the subsidies that are given. There will be real difficulties in Europe&mdash;and this applies to Ireland as well as to each of the European agricultural countries&mdash;as Europe moves away from its common agricultural policy, which indeed it must do. This must happen if it wishes to preserve its own economy. As we in Australia pressure Europe because of the damage that has been done to Australian agriculture, I feel that it is important for us to appreciate why Europeans have got into their present position through their use of subsidies. My remarks apply equally to Mr Van Acker's farm in Belgium and to Mr Ryan's farm in Ireland. The members of the delegation learned some salutary lessons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation had a number of aims; we did not just go over there to see the sights of Europe. One of our aims&mdash;and our aims are all enumerated in our report&mdash;was to assess the implications of the single market concept both for the European Community internally and externally, and also for Australia. The other aim was to promote Australia's trade interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to commend the delegation leader&mdash;and indeed this arose from strong recommendations made by previous delegations which we took up by way of goodwill&mdash;for the idea of passing out gifts to our hosts who entertained us. We thought that we would reward them with a uniquely Australian gift. One of the most popularly received gifts that we had the fortune to pass out was Australian wine. Every time it was passed out&mdash;and the delegation got none of it!&mdash;comment was made that the wine was of top quality and was produced without subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the time and the comments that were made earlier, I return to the subject of Ireland in my concluding remarks. We were fortunate to meet the new President of Ireland, Mrs Mary Robinson. She received us with great dignity at Aras an Uachtarain, the Irish President's home. There is a picture of the delegation together with the President of Ireland on page 12 of the report. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the second window from the left in the photograph, where a ghost is illuminated. It is a light that burns continuously and is something that the President has innovated since taking office. The light is in memory of all the migrants who have left Ireland for one reason or another. The Australian delegation contained two migrants from Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the fortunate experience of meeting with the Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr Charles Haughey. In my case it was a further meeting with the Prime Minister, as I have been a member of every Australian parliamentary delegation that has ever been to Ireland. Mr Haughey is known as the great survivor of world politics. There were some tensions in Ireland while we were there, which I shall not develop any further here in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One name that springs up a couple of times in our report is that of a very distinguished Australian, Sir Ninian Stephen. Sir Ninian, as honourable senators will know, was nominated earlier in the year to chair some crucial talks aimed at resolving the horrible conflict that besets the beautiful green land of Ireland. Unfortunately, despite the appointment of Sir Ninian to chair and keep the talks together, they have not actually happened. But wherever we went in Ireland wishes were expressed that it was hoped the talks would get under way. People were grateful for Australia's cooperation in encouraging Sir Ninian to undertake this enormous task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague mentioned our recommendation in regard to the International Fund for Ireland.

We note on page 15 of the report that a number of countries such as those in the European Community, the United States, Canada and New Zealand have made not insignificant contributions towards that fund. We received a detailed briefing early in the delegation visit when we first arrived. We were told of the aims of the fund&mdash;namely, to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland. My earlier comments referring to Sir Ninian Stephen will bring home the importance of those remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was taken on a tour of sections of Ireland and saw in real life how the moneys from this fund are being put to very good use by improving the social conditions of the people who live in the vicinity and providing employment for individuals. We in Australia are shocked to have 10 per cent unemployment. None of us on any side of this chamber are happy with that figure. In Ireland, the norm is 17 per cent, and in many areas the figure is much higher. This fund has directly contributed to the creation of some 10,000 to 15,000 jobs in border areas, bringing together people from diverse cultural backgrounds with the common aim of improving their immediate surroundings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was embarrassed that Australia's name is not included on that list of donors. However, I must say that I did not take the leading role in lobbying for the inclusion of the unanimous recommendation of the delegation that Australia do make a contribution to the fund. Whilst the Australian Government does not make a contribution to the fund, that is not to say that some Australian money does not go to Ireland. In this country there is an organisation called the Australian Ireland Fund through which, by means of a series of fundraising events&mdash;with which all politicians are familiar&mdash;money is raised and sent over to Ireland to assist in promoting the unification of that country. I mention that only in passing, not in any way to slight it but to make the point that members of the Australian community have already accepted their responsibility and are exercising that responsibility by putting their hands in their pockets and drawing out their wallets and, in turn, funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that recommendation 231 on page 18 of the report will be examined very carefully by the Government and that Australia will, in a very short time, take a firm decision to make a contribution to this most worthy cause. Like my colleagues in the other place who spoke to this report two weeks ago, I will not care to nominate a figure, but I do think that it should at least be approximately that given by other nations. Those amounts are enumerated on page 15. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that I have let my tongue carry me away; I have spoken for longer than I initially intended.

There are some remarks on page 71 and photographs on pages 72 and 73 of the report which are evidence of my return to my roots. Finally, I apologise for perhaps giving the Blarney stone such a big smack. Brevity should have ruled the day rather than that which you have just experienced. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was fitting that our first official engagement was to attend, at the invitation of the GAA, the all-Ireland hurling championship finals between two magnificent hurling counties&mdash;Tipperary and Kilkenny. There was a magnificent atmosphere. It is more to the Irish than just a sport. It has deep meanings for many Irish, going back decades. As I understand it, the game was forbidden at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being an incredibly green and beautiful country, Ireland is a desirable place to visit from the tourist point of view. The work that is being done, with the help of the International Fund for Ireland, to open the canals that were built a century ago and extend them, and thus the waterways, by some incredible distance&mdash;by maybe 200 kilometres&mdash;to small tourist craft is an ideal way of attracting tourists from both America and Europe, and indeed from Australia. I would like to return to Ireland at some stage and take that journey when the scheme is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that that work be done on the north-south border because it enables cooperation between the peoples of the area. I believe that there have been too many simplistic suggestions that the conflict in Northern Ireland is basically a fight over religion. It is often forgotten that a major part of the conflict was, and unfortunately still is, the problem of job discrimination. Efforts are being made to overcome that, and this is one such effort. I believe that any Anglo-Irish agreement should be supported, given the problems that the Irish have suffered over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore I agree with my colleagues that the recommendation we have made should be taken up immediately by the Government and a commitment made to that international fund. I am very pleased to see that members of the Opposition on the delegation&mdash;including you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as deputy leader of that delegation&mdash;are very strongly in support of that fund. That appears to me to be a good commitment for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of tourism, I will digress slightly and say that Ireland surely has a very good tourist Minister in Denis Lyons. He got up at about 4 a.m. Ireland time and flew in to Ireland from Austria. He put on a reception for us in Cork. He entertained us; he was the floor show. He sang and told jokes while we quaffed our Murphy's. He got the people to sing songs. His wife was a marvellous person. He wore the badge; he was a total abstainer. Those who know the history of the badge know the importance of the self-denial commitment of the wearers of the badge in response to what was and still is a problem in many parts of the world. Denis Lyons was a magnificent host, as indeed were all our hosts. It is probably a bit invidious to single out any one of them, but as we were talking about tourism I thought I might say that as it came to my mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was good that we were able first to visit farms in Ireland. One of the major missions, if not the major mission, of the delegation was to point out the problems experienced by Australia and its farming communities, and indeed the problems experienced by the taxpayers of the European Community, because of the common agricultural policy. By and large, the farms in Ireland were small family farms that were intensively cared for. The question arises that, if the CAP is abolished, where do the families on those farms go? Do they go into the cities, where there is no work available? If they leave those farming areas, what happens to the countryside? Those farmers are truly the manicurists of the environment, the beautiful environment that is Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, as I believe many members of the delegation do, that Mr McSharry, who is the European Commissioner for Agriculture, has ideas that need to be fleshed out and supported. As I understand it, he suggests that it is more important to provide income support for family farmers than to subsidise production, which chiefly benefits the very large producers on the Continent. These are the areas that need to be explored so that we can come to common ground. We all have a very hard row to hoe but, sure as eggs, if the taxpayers of Europe do not wake up very soon to what the CAP is costing them, the whole show is likely to collapse. The burden will become too heavy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to Europe. In Strasbourg we were able to question members of the European Parliament not only about the common agricultural policy but also about a number of other issues. On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of Australians of Croatian and Slovenian descent, we asked members of the European Parliament why they appeared so powerless to engender a peaceful solution to the problem. Here we are in Strasbourg, allegedly in the civilised twentieth century, when a few miles down the road absolute barbarism is occurring. The responses we received were inept, as has been the action since&mdash;threatened boycotts, threats to cut off supplies to the Yugoslav Army. Has that materialised? What is the civilised world doing to stop this barbarism?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Brussels and Strasbourg I had discussions with members of the European Parliament and with a number of bureaucrats on issues of fundamental importance to the future of humanity. I refer to human embryo experimentation and to euthanasia. Unfortunately, an ugly development is occurring in some parts of Europe which has an all too familiar ring, recalling events of years gone by in pre-war Nazi Germany and during the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those words `Lebensunwertes Leben', life unworthy of life, are echoing in the current euthanasia debate and in the push for research-driven human embryo experimentation. I believe that members of the European Parliament must take note of this and realise that they must ensure that the bureaucrats in Brussels adhere to the fundamental principles upon which European civilisation was based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that, politically, there are problems in a united Europe and one of those problems is, in fact, how the European Parliament will exercise its audit and control function over the bureaucracy in Brussels.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SERVICES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major purpose of this Bill is to implement decisions in the area of aged care announced by the Government in the 1991-92 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Bill proposes a significant amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to enable Community Care Packages to be provided to frail older people continuing to reside in their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will appreciate that the fundamental objective of the Government's Aged Care policy is to extend the independence of older people in the community through the provision of care services. All surveys of older people have shown that they prefer to stay at home and receive care, rather than move to a residential facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of Community Aged Care Services Packages is an important step in this process. As was announced in the Budget, rather than having a long-term target to provide 60 hostel places per 1000 people over 70, we will now aim to provide 55 hostel places. As a substitution for the reduction in hostel places, we will introduce Community Aged Care Services Packages. This means that the packages will replace some of the hostel places which would otherwise have been built.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the Community Aged Care Services Packages is to allow aged people to receive hostel personal care services in their homes. They will be targeted at people with higher dependency levels or complex care needs who are assessed as being at risk of admission to, or in need of, residential care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program will provide complete packages of services which are designed to meet each individual's assessed needs and which build upon the recipient's potential for independent living in their own homes and the support they presently receive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of packages which will be approved is based on the number of hostel places foregone. The packages will be developed at the rate at which the hostel places would have come on stream. This means that in the initial years the numbers are relatively small but will grow to around a thousand places by year three of the phase-in period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initial approvals for Community Aged Care Services Packages will particularly concentrate on those areas of Australia in which it is difficult to build viable hostels due to factors such as the cost of building, the concentration of people in an area who require care or the lack of suitable land. This is true of many rural or remote areas but is also true for some inner city areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The packages will be funded at a level similar to the care subsidy provided for hostel residents requiring support for personal care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both community and residential care providers will be eligible to receive funding for providing Community Aged Care Services Packages. The approved provider will be able to use the existing resources of each area by using its own service base, volunteer services, and through use of other service providers in the area. In this way full use will be made of existing service infrastructure while gaps that exist now will be filled. This should help develop links between residential and community providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of this change in emphasis, the name of the Act will be changed to "Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further provisions of this Bill seek to amend this newly titled Act in order to restructure the existing hostel Personal Care Subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As foreshadowed in the Budget, following a review of hostel recurrent funding, the Government has decided to restructure hostel personal care funding. This was seen as necessary to target funding to those residents with high levels of physical frailty and to those suffering from dementia. The restructured personal care subsidy will provide clear incentives for hostels to provide care for more highly dependent and confused people consistent with the objectives of the aged care strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An additional $14.6m will be available in a full year in support of the restructured subsidy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing arrangements provide for only one level of personal care subsidy for a wide range of care needs. This is a disincentive for hostels to admit more frail residents. It is essential that hostels be encouraged to expand their role in caring for more highly dependent residents because of the rapid growth of the aged population and because of the more specialised role of nursing homes in caring for those residents who require continuous nursing care and supervision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements will provide for three levels of funding for residents requiring personal care:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">additional support will be available for the top 10 percent of residents who are very physically frail, including people with dementia;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">additional funding will be directed to residents with a moderate degree of confusion or dementia; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">residents with moderate personal care needs will continue to be supported; the threshold at which a resident can attract the subsidy will be effectively lowered in recognition of the requirement for personal care support services by a greater number of residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing dementia grants program will be phased out over a two year period and incorporated into recurrent funding. The two higher subsidy levels will be provided to all hostels which provide care to dementia sufferers as compared with only about 37 per cent of hostels under the dementia grants program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All hostel residents assessed as needing support for dementia will now receive support compared to the fifty percent of such residents under current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing recipients of dementia grants will receive transitional assistance during the phase-out of the current funding. The situation facing any hostel at the end of the phase-out period will depend on the care need profile of their residents and the subsidy level they attract for those residents in July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains provisions to amend the existing Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act to enable some control to be exerted over the quality of persons operating hostels approved under that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until now, there has not been an effective measure available to address the problem of unsuitable persons becoming the operators of approved hostels. In 1989, in recognition of the need to create such a control in the nursing home sector, the National Health Act was amended to ensure the suitability of proprietors of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments now before the Senate will create the same control over the quality of persons operating approved hostels. These amendments will make it a condition of a hostel's approval that the person operating, or proposing to operate a hostel, be approved as an Approved Operator. Where a hostel is in breach of this condition, the Commonwealth will be under no obligation to sustain financial assistance by way of recurrent subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to approve or refuse an applicant, or to revoke the approval of an existing Approved Operator, will be based on consideration of a person's ability to satisfy certain criteria. Broadly, these criteria will include relevant experience, honesty, efficiency, and history in the aged care industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the National Health Act 1953, the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974, and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to revoke approvals to the 17 remaining nursing homes for disabled people and 3 remaining hostels for disabled people at the time the existing Commonwealth/State Disability Agreements come into full operation in each State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are necessary to allow these remaining nursing homes and hostels for disabled people to be included in the transfer of administrative responsibility for all Commonwealth funded disability accommodation services to the States as the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and all States and Territories on 30 July 1991, come into full operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in the bill relating to the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type or referred diagnostic imaging services are designed to enable the payment of benefits of certain imaging requested by physiotherapists. The services for which physiotherapists are to be formally recognised as requesters are X-rays of the spine and pelvic area. This amendment gives physiotherapists the same recognition in the ordering of imaging services as chiropractors. The amendment acknowledges that spinal X-rays are important in determining whether spinal manipulation can be performed safely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains minor consequential amendments to the Act to allow a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry to examine cases relating to the rendering of excessive pathology services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Food Authority Act 1991 was passed by the Parliament in June 1991 and was proclaimed to come into effect on 19 August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act created the National Food Authority, with responsibility for the development and amendment of food standards. These standards will be adopted by the States and Territories under an agreement signed by Heads of Government in July 1991 at the Special Premiers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 71 of the Act contains provisions aimed at ensuring as smooth a transition as possible from the system which operated under the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) before 19 August to the system now operated by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the proposed amendment to section 71 of the Act is two-fold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, it deals with a problem which has become apparent in the handling of a large group of recommendations made by the NHMRC to the National Food Standards Council on 14 August 1991, but not dealt with by the Council before the Act came into effect on 19 August 1991. The Authority has become aware since the Act commenced that this group of recommendations, representing over 50 separate matters, is now disqualified from being included within the Food Standards Code as defined in the Act. Had the Council dealt with the recommendations before 19 August, they would have been eligible for inclusion in the Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of this amendment, it would be necessary for the Authority now to consider each of those matters under the procedures laid down in the Act. This would represent a large increase in the Authority's workload, with consequent lengthy delays in finalising many matters which had been virtually completed by the NHMRC. Many of these matters involve changes to food standards requested by the food industry or by consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment provides that, where the NHMRC had made a recommendation to the Council, but the Council had not made a decision before the commencement of the Act, such recommendations are deemed to have been recommendations made under the Act. This will allow outstanding matters on which the NHMRC had made recommendations to be dealt with as quickly as possible, and will avoid the necessity for the National Food Authority to have to consider each of these matters again under the procedures laid down in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second purpose achieved by the amendment is to ensure that outstanding proposals can be dealt with in the same way as currently provided for outstanding applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications are requests by outside parties for changes to the Food Standards Code, and are most often made by the food industry. The Act provides that applications which were in existence before the Act commenced are deemed to continue in existence, and imposes a time limit of two years within which the Authority must make a recommendation to the Council on these applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposals, on the other hand, are matters which arise from within the food regulatory system. The intention behind proposals is frequently to rationalise or simplify or clarify provisions in food standards, to remove anomalies apparent to food authorities, or to provide increased protection of food consumers. The Act makes no provision for the continued existence of proposals which were in existence before the Act commenced, and this means that matters which had been almost finalised under the NHMRC system would have to be reintroduced from the beginning of the process laid down in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment not only provides for proposals which were in existence before the commencement of the Act to continue in existence but, more importantly, allows the Authority to deal with them in the same way as it can deal with applications. This means the Authority will be empowered to omit steps in the public process of dealing with a proposal, having regard to the stage which the proposal had reached under the NHMRC system. Thus proposals which had been almost finalised by the NHMRC can be considered by the Authority at an advanced stage rather than having to start from the beginning of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment also introduces a time limit of two years within which the Authority must either make a recommendation to the Council on an outstanding proposal or must decide to abandon the proposal. This is the same time limit as currently applies to outstanding applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this amendment will be to streamline the handling of matters which were outstanding when the Authority came into existence and to reduce delays in the Authority's consideration of such matters, to the advantage of both the food industry and food consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is actively promoting the concept of day surgery. In December 1989 a four level differential benefit was introduced into the health insurance basic table to encourage the growth of day only procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an effort to ensure that the growth of day surgery did not emanate from treatment that was performed in doctors rooms, or treatment that was traditionally provided in hospitals as out-patients, the Department produced a Type C [exclusion list] professional attention list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This exclusion list [a list of Medicare Benefits Schedule procedures not normally done in hospital on a day only basis] prevents hospitals and day hospital facilities from receiving an accommodation benefit if a procedure on the list is undertaken on a day only basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I acknowledge that there will be occasions when an item on the exclusion list could be performed in hospital on a day only basis. In these circumstances provision exists for certification by the treating medical practitioner stating that his/her patient required day admission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This certification procedure currently only applies to public and private hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed will enable day hospital facilities access to the same certification mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which will give effect to two of the changes to the nursing and personal care funding arrangements for non-government nursing homes announced in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One set of amendments will enable a nursing home to delay applying for a new classification for a patient whose previous classification expired during or shortly after return from hospital leave.  A new application now will not need to be made until the resident's care needs have been carefully assessed following their return to the nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new classification will take effect from the date of return to the nursing home, or the date the previous classification expired, whichever is the later. These amendments will remove the present incentive for a nursing home to apply prematurely and inaccurately for a new classification, in order to avoid funding being reduced to the lowest classification level between the date on which the previous classification expired and the date the new application is determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments address nursing homes' concerns about delays in receiving funding for the nursing and personal care of new residents. The amendments provide for a nursing home to receive interim funding for a new patient at the lowest classification level from the date of admission, pending assessment of the resident's on-going care needs and submission of an application for annual funding based on that assessment. When the application is approved, funding will be adjusted to the appropriate classification level from the date of admission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains a number of additional amendments to the National Health Act in relation to nursing home matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following upon the recently completed review of nursing home infrastructure funding, the Government has introduced provisions to enable additional funding for isolated homes, and for homes caring for residents who receive nasogastric feeding or continuous oxygen. It has also introduced provisions to enable supplementary recurrent funding for proprietors who build new homes without receiving capital grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these provisions is for isolated nursing homes whose infrastructure costs are substantially higher than those of most other homes because of their isolated location, such as in Alice Springs or Cobar. The proposed principles will enable the Minister to compensate homes according to their remoteness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent provisions enable provision of additional funding for homes caring for residents who receive nasogastric feeding or continuous oxygen. This will ensure that residents do not have to pay for these costs. People needing these services sometimes stay in a hospital because it provides the services to them at no cost, when in fact hospital care is inappropriate to their needs. The new funding will help prevent this. The provisions will also enable the Minister to approve funding at different levels in accordance with the needs of different residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last of this series of provisions will enable supplementary recurrent funding to be provided for some proprietors who build new homes or new premises for existing homes, but do not get capital funding. Charitable and Benevolent organisations have for many years been eligible for capital grants to assist them to build new nursing homes or rebuild existing homes. These new provisions will assist some of those who have not received such grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the great majority of nursing home proprietors are ethical operators who provide good care to their clients, a small number have a record of unsatisfactory practices in the industry. The Government does not consider that it would be appropriate to encourage these people to remain in the industry by providing them with the additional recurrent funding for new nursing home buildings. The proposed legislation therefore allows the Minister to take into account a proprietor's record in the industry when considering an application for this additional funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces an offence in the National Health Act for providing false or misleading information in applications to become Approved Operators of nursing homes. Nursing home approval is conditional on the proprietor being an Approved Operator. Approval as an Approved Operator is only granted where a person is considered suitable to be the proprietor of an approved nursing home. It is important, therefore, to ensure that the information supplied in support of an application for approved operator status is accurate and truthful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment increases the various penalties contained in the National Health Act relating to the administration of the Commonwealth's nursing home recurrent funding program. The reason for increasing the penalties is to ensure that they provide both effective deterrents and appropriate sanctions in respect of the matters to which they relate. In view of the time elapsed since they were introduced, they no longer do this. The proposed amendments will reinstate their effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also contains provision to correct an unintended effect on the rights of aggrieved applicants to seek review of Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (PRA) recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will allow aggrieved applicants to seek an Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) review of PRA recommendations relating to the approval of pharmacies, the payment of essential pharmacy allowance and the provision of financial assistance with the amalgamation or closure of pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will have retrospective effect and allow all those applicants aggrieved by past recommendations of the PRA to seek review of those recommendations by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION (HEALTH SERVICES)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CHARGE BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in the context of the Budget, the Government announced measures which would allow for improvements to the arrangements for the recovery of costs to the Commonwealth health and welfare budget which flow from the Migration Program. The Migration Program operates to Australia's benefit but there is a level of cost attached to some of its components. The Government proposes to improve existing cost recovery measures, through changes to the Assurance of Support Scheme and through the provisions of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides for the payment, by certain classes of migrants and persons approved for permanent residence, of a Migration (Health Services) Charge of $822 to offset Commonwealth health expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before dealing with the specifics of the Bill, it is desirable to provide an overview of the Assurance of Support Scheme. In general terms, an Assurance of Support is a legal commitment made by the assurer to repay to the Commonwealth, States, public or charitable institutions any money or the value of any goods or services paid out to support the person or persons covered by the Assurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Assurance is an essential criterion under the Migration Regulations for applicants for permanent entry and stay in certain classes and a discretionary criterion in most other classes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Assurance is to ensure that the burden of some costs which newcomers may generate during their initial years of residence in Australia are borne by their sponsoring families and not by the general community. It is important to note that the existence of an Assurance does not mean that any person covered by it cannot receive social security benefits or other assistance. Rather, it means that the assurer is liable to repay any support that is received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Assurance of Support Scheme will be introduced by amendment to the Migration Regulations. The new scheme will reduce the liabilities which the assurer undertakes. First, the validity of the Assurance will be reduced from the current five years to only two years. This represents a marked decrease in the time taken to incur debts. Secondly, the debts that may be recovered have been restricted to special benefits and job search and newstart allowances paid by the Commonwealth. Other support costs will no longer be recoverable. The provisions for the recovery of limited health costs were outdated and not operating effectively. As a result they will be removed from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a separate but related measure, this Bill provides a more effective means for the recovery of health costs by the Commonwealth. In the Budget context it was announced that the Assurance of Support Scheme would be augmented by a refundable bond and a non-refundable health charge. The charge, introduced by this Bill, is to be paid in addition to the Medicare levy. It will offset part of the cost to the Commonwealth of providing access to medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits to certain migrants during their first two years as permanent residents in Australia. The charge affects only those migrants in respect of whom the Assurance is an essential criterion&mdash;parents who meet the balance of family test, aged dependent, last remaining, special need and orphan minor relatives and the Lebanese concession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payment of the charge will in no way affect the existing requirement that all migrants have to satisfy Commonwealth health standards. If all criteria are met for the grant of a visa or entry permit and if the charge is paid they will enter or will be approved to stay in Australia as permanent residents. As new permanent residents they have immediate access to our health and welfare systems, but are unlikely to have made the same lifetime contribution through taxes as other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The health charge will enable the Government to recover an estimated 50% of the average medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs incurred by persons covered by the Assurance and will result in an additional estimated revenue to the Commonwealth of $9.9m in a full financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the bond and the health charge reinforces the understanding by applicants and persons who give assurances of the costs of migration. It is expected that this will result in more careful consideration by the parties involved of their financial commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill imposes the charge on applicants in the classes  mentioned who have lodged their applications on or after 21 August 1991. It provides that the charge be paid after all other criteria are met and before a visa or entry permit may be granted. It also provides for exemptions from the charge for those persons who withdraw their applications. Persons who have paid the charge in respect of a class of visa are also exempt from paying any charge for the grant of the equivalent class of entry permit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that the charge retains its value in relation to health costs in future years, the Bill provides for the indexation of the charge on an annual basis in line with the All Group Consumer Price Index.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will provide a more effective approach to the protection of the Commonwealth's health budget than was available under the old Assurance of Support Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs explained the Government's decisions in the Budget context in relation to the Assurance of Support Scheme and the imposition of a health charge in his Second Reading Speech on the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill. That Bill imposed the liability; however, to give effect to the collection of the charge, changes to the Migration Act 1958 are required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes the necessary changes to the Migration Act 1958 in relation to my powers to grant or refuse visas and entry permits in that such grants in the affected classes cannot be made unless the health charge has been paid. The Bill also requires that applicants be notified of the requirement and that their visa or entry permit cannot be granted until the payment is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the regulation making power to allow for the remission, refund or waiver of the charge. Regulations will be made providing refunds to those applicants who, after having been granted a visa, do not travel to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Minister indicated in introducing the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill, the health charge will enable the Government to recover an estimated 50% of the average medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs incurred by persons covered by the Assurance and will result in an additional estimated revenue to the Commonwealth of $9.9m in a full financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">(NO. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is a further step in the Government's program to foster a more vigorous and diverse broadcasting industry, through reform in the regulatory system that guides it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It amends the Broadcasting Act 1942 to implement reforms which, together with a related Bill dealing with licence fee matters, will encourage more expeditious introduction of new FM commercial and supplementary radio services to listeners in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regional radio program has been under way since 1987 and has brought FM commercial radio to well over two million regional Australians. But progress has fallen far short of our intentions, due in part to flaws in the program itself, compounded by the particular economic woes which have afflicted the media industry generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far too much effort has been wasted on the part of the Government, the radio industry, aspirant broadcasters and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, in planning and licensing procedures which all too often have failed to advance the range and diversity of services available to the public. Honourable Senators may be aware that the Government is about to put forward for public discussion an approach to broadcasting regulation reform which addresses these problems in a fundamental way. However, in the case of regional radio, we have decided that urgent remedial measures should not be put off pending that fundamental reform, which covers a far broader canvas. That is the reason this Bill is before the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in this Bill will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)define the term `commercial viability' for the purposes of the licensing provisions of the Broadcasting Act and limit the circumstances in which commercial viability is considered by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal when conducting certain licence grant inquiries;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)enable a supplementary radio licence to serve an area smaller than that served by the related commercial radio licence, when the Tribunal concludes that it would not be viable to serve the greater area;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)enable a supplementary radio licence to be separated from the related commercial radio licence any  time from two years after the commencement of the supplementary service; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)substantially reduce the fees payable by new services commencing on the FM band, and transfer provisions relating to the calculation of fees to the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964: and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)provide for equity as between the various types of new FM service that may be proposed for an area by introducing a comparable establishment fee for a supplementary licence, and by providing for the direct conversion of AM services to FM on payment of a fee. Each of these fees will be calculated according to a common formula which accounts for a range of factors which relate to the commercial value of an FM broadcasting channel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will discuss the fees arrangements in more detail in the context of the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments reflect the Government's intention to move towards a regulatory environment in which the planning and introduction of future commercial services will be increasingly commercially determined. Australia has a strong commercial radio industry which has provided much welcomed services to regional Australians over many years. However, it is abundantly clear that a long period when single radio services tried to serve the interests of whole communities is drawing rapidly to a close. The future, like it or not, lies with greater numbers of services targeting narrower audiences, as we have already seen in the larger cities. I am confident that the present commercial radio industry, along with some fresh participants, will rise to this challenge and participate keenly and competitively in the new opportunities for additional services which are encouraged through these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In parallel with these legislative changes, I have announced procedural changes aimed at speeding up licensing outcomes. These include the abandonment of the "market groups" approach involving ministerial prima facie categorisation of markets, and its replacement with a set of planning criteria more responsive to market characteristics and individual initiatives. Changes to planning policy regarding AM/FM conversions should also assist existing regional AM broadcasters to make the most of the commercial opportunities of the FM band.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing administrative and fiscal burdens on the broadcasting industry is also the purpose of provisions in the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991, for changes to the current arrangements under which all commercial broadcasting  licensees pay annual licence fees to the Commonwealth and to the level of licence fees collected from commercial radio licensees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills amend the Broadcasting Act 1942, the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 and the Television Licence Fees Act 1964 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is always a responsibility of Government to maintain a proper balance between the contributions an industry makes to the nation, on the one hand through various forms of taxation, and on the other hand through meeting specific industry objectives. In bringing forward amendments to halve the rate of licence fees for commercial radio, the Government reaffirms its objective of encouraging the development of a more diverse and competitive industry sector delivering audio services free to the public, but supported by commercial revenue. This industry will face considerable challenges over the next few years as more and different forms of services enter the media marketplace. But commercial radio will remain a major part of the mix of public mass media services and is assured of a significant future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main features of the Bills are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)to amend the current licence fee scale for all commercial radio licensees, by simply halving the amount they currently pay as annual licence fees;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)to provide for a common due date for the payment of annual licence fees for both commercial radio and television broadcasters; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)to require licensees to carry out their own assessment of the amount they are required to pay to the Commonwealth as licence fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Broadcasting Amendment Bill(No.2) also includes a minor amendment to the Broadcasting Act 1942 to enable public radio licensees in areas where there is no overlapping terrestrial commercial radio service to broadcast sponsorship announcements which promote products and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to give some detailed attention to particular provisions of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial Viability</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience has shown that much of the time taken in Broadcasting Tribunal inquiries into the introduction of regional commercial radio services stems from the current legislative requirements relating to the consideration of commercial viability. When making a decision to grant non-limited licences, the Tribunal must have regard to the  need for the commercial viability of other services licensed to serve all or part of the same area. The Tribunal must also have regard to commercial viability in fulfilling some of its other statutory licensing obligations. The provisions concerned can involve the Tribunal in wide ranging and exhaustive investigations on its own account or at the behest of parties opposed to the introduction of a new service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will reduce the Tribunal's current obligation to seek independent certainty in assessing commercial viability, by inserting an interpretive rule which restricts the meaning of the term commercial viability for the purpose of the relevant provisions. The amendment provides that a service is commercially viable if, and only if, the Tribunal is satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the service will continue to be provided under the licence until its expiration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also place limitations on the consideration of commercial viability in Tribunal inquiries. In the past too much emphasis has been placed on the commercial viability criterion at the expense of other equally important considerations such as the desirability of introducing more services which would give the public more listening choice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tribunal will now not consider the need for the commercial viability of the service of an overlapping non-limited licence unless the licensee satisfies the Tribunal that the service would not be commercially viable after the grant of the proposed licence. For the Tribunal to consider the need for commercial viability of overlapping services the affected licensees will be required to establish that a real problem exists. It will no longer be a potential opening for filibustering and procedural delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With these amendments, the Government confirms its view that, in the interests of encouraging diversity of media ownership, it is preferable that a competitive service be introduced where it is reasonably practicable to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently provides that where an application for a supplementary licence has been lodged and the Minister has published a notice inviting applications for a commercial radio licence with an overlapping service area, the Tribunal can consider the applications simultaneously. There is no specific guidance in the Act to indicate a preference for an independent service over a supplementary service when the Tribunal is considering the two types of licences simultaneously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the relevant sections to give a clear preference for the commercial licence, when the Tribunal is considering applications for a commercial radio licence in  such circumstances and determines that the market can support only one additional licence. The application for the commercial radio licence would of course need to be found to satisfy the relevant criteria regarding suitability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this same context, it is intended that the Tribunal place more emphasis on the public interest consideration that it is desirable, where practicable, to increase the number of broadcasting services available to the general public. To achieve this an additional criterion has been included to require the Tribunal to have regard, when weighing the public interest in considering whether a commercial radio or supplementary radio licence should be granted, to the policy that the number of services available to the public should be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supplementary Licences</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 82A of the Broadcasting Act enables applications to be made by holders of commercial AM radio licences for supplementary licences, and for such applications to be referred to the Tribunal for consideration. Once again, in the interests of encouraging additional services wherever possible, the Government believes there is merit in advancing supplementary licence applications where independent commercial radio services are not feasible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces streamlining measures for the grant of supplementary licences. In an inquiry where the only application being considered is for the grant of a supplementary radio licence, the Tribunal will not be required to determine whether a commercial radio licence serving the same area would be reasonably likely to be commercially viable during the period for which the supplementary radio licence would be in force. Similarly in such inquiries, the only overlapping services which the Tribunal should be required to consider in its deliberations on commercial viability are commercial radio services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also provide the Tribunal with a discretion to grant supplementary licences that will serve an area less than that served by the related commercial radio licence in circumstances where a wider service would not be viable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 83F of the Broadcasting Act allows the Minister, at any time before the grant of a licence, to revoke the service specifications determined in relation to the licence and determine new specifications. This section is amended to enable the Tribunal to recommend before the grant of a supplementary licence that the service area be smaller than, but wholly within the service area of the related commercial licence, and for the Minister to redetermine the service specifications accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment recognises that in some cases a supplementary licence may not be viable if it has to serve the whole service area of the related commercial licence, but it could be viable if it only served part of that area. In this way the chances of a second service being licensed are increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to provide scope to separate a supplementary radio licence from the related commercial radio licence after a period of two years are consistent with the Government's preference for a diversity of media ownership and will also apply to existing supplementary licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 89A(10) requires the Tribunal to refuse to consent to the transfer of a commercial radio licence that is related to a supplementary radio licence unless the supplementary radio licence is transferred to the person at the same time. This is amended to enable the commercial radio licence and the supplementary licence to be transferred separately after a period of two years beginning on the day of commencement of the service under the supplementary licence. The supplementary licence would thereupon become a commercial licence in its own right for the balance of the original term of the supplementary licence. It is intended that for those existing supplementary licensees whose date of commencement precedes these amendments, the two year period should also be calculated from their date of commencement of service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in those cases where the Tribunal has licensed a supplementary service which has a service area that is not substantially the same as the related commercial licence, this process of separation would not be available. Where such separation was sought, it would be necessary for the licensee to first seek to have the service area of the supplementary licence expanded to match that of the commercial licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now address the provisions which deal with changes to the current licence fee assessment and collection arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the suggestion of the Tribunal, the Government has decided that the current licence fee collection scheme, for both radio and television licence fees, should be streamlined by introducing a self-assessment scheme, with all licence fees falling due on the 31st of December each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the introduction of the licence fee common due date, the Bill provides for the initial calculation of each licensee's licence fee to be carried out by the licensee. Under the present system this function is performed by the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill requires each licensee to calculate the amount owing to the Commonwealth as annual licence fees, and for penalties to apply if this amount is not lodged with the Tribunal on the 31st of December each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill empowers the Tribunal, upon receiving each licensee's financial information and self-assessed licence fee, to check each licensee's accounts and licence fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tribunal will then issue any re-assessment notices of additional amounts payable to the Commonwealth in the event of a licensee under-calculating the licence fee owed, or refunds of overpayments owing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Tribunal assessed additional payments are to be made by the licensee within a period of 21 days after the Tribunal's re-assessment notice. The Tribunal should also repay any amounts overpaid within this 21 day period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for a penalty of 20% per annum of the amount of any unpaid licence fees, calculated from the date of issue of the Tribunal's re-assessment notice, to be due and payable after the 21 day period for the payment of additional assessments, and which accrues until licence fees are paid in full.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also enables the Tribunal to determine whether a licensee has deliberately miscalculated the amount of licence fee payable, and for the penalty of 20% per annum of unpaid licence fees to apply from 31 December and not 21 days from the date of issue of the notice. This provision has been included to deter licensees from deliberately miscalculating the amount of licence fee owed to the Commonwealth in order to gain an extension of time to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for a penalty of 20% per annum of unpaid licence fees, calculated from the 31st of December by the Tribunal, to be due and payable from the 31st of December, for those licensees who fail to pay their licence fees on that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are changes contained in this Bill which are related to amendments in both the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 which require the payment of all commercial radio and television annual licence fees on 31 December each year. I will explain these amendments in detail when I deal with the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the moment however, let me say that section 123 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 needs to be altered to keep in line with the amendments providing for the new 31 December common due date, as contained in both the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 123A of the Broadcasting Act dealing with penalties for unpaid licence fees has also been amended to line up with the new 31 December due date provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will simplify the administration and collection of commercial broadcasting licence fees for the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the minor amendment of s119AB, relating to sponsorship announcements on public radio stations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions relating to sponsorship announcements currently set out in section 119AB of the Broadcasting Act prohibit the broadcasting of any promotional material in a sponsorship announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment allows public stations in areas with no terrestrial commercial radio services to broadcast promotional sponsorship announcements. The Tribunal will still have the power to impose standards on such announcements if it feels these are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be queried why the Government is introducing this Bill when a draft Broadcasting Services Bill is to be soon tabled in the Parliament. In the case of the regional radio program, there is a need for transitional amendments to ensure progress toward the introduction of new services during the next 12 months, while at the same time keeping such amendments to a minimum and in line with the general thrust of the wider review of broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to the statutory licensing criteria are not expected to have a significant impact on expenditure or revenue but should enable the Tribunal to make more efficient use of its resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the broadcasting industry is a dynamic one undergoing rapid technical and economic changes. The amendments in this Bill are part of a resolute commitment on the part of the Government that regulatory arrangements assist that process of change and do not retard it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">RADIO LICENCE FEES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will implement reforms which will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)in relation to the annual licence fees arrangements for broadcasting services&mdash;implement measures announced in the budget to halve the current level of annual commercial, supplementary and remote radio licence fees and streamline the taxation arrangements for broadcasting licensees; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)in relation to the regional commercial radio program&mdash;abolish the current establishment and AM/FM conversion fees and replace them with an FM access fee to be paid by all commercial and supplementary non-metropolitan radio licensees before they commence a service on the FM band.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now deal with the provisions of the bill which halve the rate of commercial radio licence fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major revisions to the rate at which commercial radio and television licence fees are levied have occurred since 1975-76. The licence fees scales were last amended in 1987, and the present formulae apply to licence fees collected in and after the 1987-88 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes were made to reflect the broadcasting industry's perceived capacity to pay, and were achieved through increasing the number of brackets at the upper end of the progressive fee scale, as well as increasing the related percentage of gross earnings paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, bracket creep and inflation have meant that these changes have caused the increase in the level of commercial broadcasters' licence fees to exceed the increase in their gross earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has resulted in increases in the level of commercial radio licence fees exceeding the increase in commercial radio gross earnings by an average of 8% per annum over the ten year period to the 1989-90 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While licence fees paid by commercial television licensees have also increased over this time, the increase in these fees has been at a lower rate than for radio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While licence fees as a proportion of licensees' gross earnings have risen considerably for both radio and television licensees, the Government has decided to reduce the level of licence fees for commercial radio licensees only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time for us to start to think of radio and television as the two different and separate media that they are.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This cut in the level of radio licence fees is the first step in the government's move to separate the regulation of commercial radio from that of commercial television.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the commercial radio industry has been coping with rapid technological change, while facing  greatly increased competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regional commercial radio plan has seen thirteen new radio services introduced into regional areas in Australia, and seven of the planned ten new FM radio services under stage one of the National Metropolitan Radio Plan have begun serving listeners in the capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, licence fees for commercial radio licensees have been increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes the Australian public will be better served by commercial radio broadcasters if this extra drain on their cash flows is moderated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill redresses the high level of licence fees for commercial radio licensees by reducing the current level of these fees by 50%. This reduction will be achieved by halving the constant and co-efficient components of each of the formulae currently used to calculate the level of radio licence fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This method of adjusting the licence fee regime will provide for the simple, direct and equitable treatment of all commercial radio licensees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 is to be amended to reduce the fee, with these amendments taking effect from 1 January 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction will be applicable to all annual commercial radio licence fees due on and from 1 January 1992, which includes licence fees for the 1990-91 financial year, thus providing radio licensees immediate licence fee relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now address the new due date for the payment of all commercial broadcasting annual licence fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present system licence fees for licensees whose anniversary date of service commencement is in the first half of the financial year fall due on the 1st of January, and licence fees for licensees whose anniversary date of service commencement occurs in the second half of the financial year, fall due on that anniversary date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this means is that licensees whose anniversary date falls between the 1st of January and the 30th of June, have up to 6 months to pay their licence fees than other licensees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that there are no reasons for the current staggered fee payment system to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill, together with the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991, provides for a new licence fee due date, which will be the same for all commercial radio and  television licensees, regardless of each licensee's anniversary date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The common due date will be the 31st of December in each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that all commercial radio and television licensees will be required to pay their annual licence fees on the 31st of December in each year&mdash;which is the same day they lodge their financial documents with the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new common due date will commence on the 31st of December 1992, encompassing licence fees for the 1991-92 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry was informed of this change in August 1991, and we believe that all licensees will have had enough time to plan for the common due date, and to make the necessary arrangements for the payment of their 1991-92 licence fees on the 31st of December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Halving the level of radio licence fees will reduce Commonwealth revenue from commercial radio licence fees by approximately $8 million in the 1991-92 collection year, being for licence fees for 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that for the following collection year the Commonwealth will forgo $8.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proportion of these amounts will flow back to the Commonwealth in the form of increased company tax, to the extent that the licence fee reductions are reflected in increased profits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These estimates remain subject to any changes which may be made as part of the reviews being carried out by my Department, as I mentioned earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changing the licence fee due date to 31 December is not expected to have an impact on the level of Commonwealth revenue collected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It means, however, that some Commonwealth revenue will be received up to 6 months earlier than under the present scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the introduction of a new fee structure for the regional commercial radio program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current fees structure has proved to have a number of failings:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its levels were set in 1988 and reflected speculative valuations on FM channels, rather than sustainable commercial values;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">it could not be applied to FM allocations other than new independent services and conversions where a new FM service entered the market; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">its progressive scale relied on "brackets" which could produce inequities at the bracket margins and were naturally subject to inflationary "bracket creep".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition the high level of fees discouraged applications for new licences and was a contributing factor to the difficulties a commercial radio licensee faces in establishing a new service in the current economic climate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing a new FM Access Fee the Government's aim is to provide a fee structure which is more effective in supporting the Government's objectives for regional commercial radio broadcasting. The title of the fee indicates that it is levied as a resource allocation fee for a valuable part of the electromagnetic spectrum, rather than an entry fee to a protected market. In form it is intended to remove a degree of discriminatory burden on new independent services and provide for greater equity between different FM service providers, in that the new fee will also apply to supplementary services and AM/FM conversions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The calculation of the FM Access Fee takes into account the number of commercial radio services operating in a given service area and the relevant average gross earnings for these services. Responsibility for calculating and advising affected parties of fees payable will now rest with the Tribunal, rather than with the Minister as is currently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One key problem with the current establishment fee system is that the new licensee must outlay a substantial fee within a period of 60 days of the offer of the licence, but cannot commence service, and begin earning revenue, until the service has been physically established. This process may take up to 6 to 12 months from the date of the Tribunal's decision and often involves delays beyond the licensee's control. To redress this, the new FM Access Fee will be payable prior to commencement of the service, with commencement of service being conditional upon payment of the fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new fee structure will be effective on the commencement of this Amendment Act. With regard to Tribunal inquiries which are already in progress, transitional amendments have been included to ensure that where possible successful applicants will be able to take advantage of the new lower fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure and revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill dealing with a number of pieces of Commonwealth legislation. I want to make mention of those which we think are the more important and to which we have amendments. The first is the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970. This Act provides for the operation of State laws in and around Commonwealth places. The State law applies as Commonwealth legislation, and offences committed in these places are deemed to be Commonwealth offences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to the recently carried legislation, the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991, which inserted a new part 1(c) into the Crimes Act 1914, State police would have to follow the scheme of rights duties and obligations that apply when an investigating official investigates a Commonwealth offence. In effect, State police, when investigating offences in Commonwealth places, would be obliged to follow the regime set up for Commonwealth police. The amendment in this Bill makes it clear that State police are not bound by part 1(c) of the Crimes Act 1914 when investigating applied Commonwealth offences and that they do not therefore need to follow the Commonwealth regime. Pursuant to subclause 2(3) of this Bill, this amendment is taken to have commenced retrospectively on 1 November 1991, which is the date on which part 1(c) of the Crimes Act comes into operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition welcomes this amendment. At the time of the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Bill being debated we expressed concern that the legislation would have an adverse impact on the operations of State police. I doubt whether the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, remembers that debate in the committee stage. Obviously in this respect a different code of conduct would apply for the investigation of an offence, depending where the offence was committed. So we are pleased about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Act I want to raise is the Family Law Act 1975. This Bill amends the Family Law Act to give the Family Court jurisdiction with respect to custody, guardianship or access orders that may be made under State or Territory legislation dealing with the welfare of children. The amendments assume that the States will refer to the Commonwealth further powers under State child welfare legislation. They relate to part 7 of the Act, which sets out the Family Court's powers in relation to children. The definition of child welfare officer for the purposes of section 60H and new section 66FA is to include a person who has child welfare responsibilities under a State or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 60E is amended to provide for the Governor-General by proclamation to declare that these amendments extend to a specified State in the event of the necessary referral of power by that State. Pursuant to the amendments to section 60H, the Family Court will have the power to make orders in certain circumstances in relation to a child in the custody, care and control, guardianship or under the supervision of a person under a State or Territory child welfare law. The Court will be able to make an order for the maintenance of such a child. It will also be able to make custody, guardianship or access orders for a child who is subject to supervision under a State child welfare law. Thirdly, the Court will be able to make orders under the Family Law Act where a State or Territory child welfare officer consents to the commencement or continuation of the Family Law Act proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 66 is amended by the insertion of section 66FA, which provides that maintenance proceedings in relation to a child who is under the guardianship or in the custody or care and control of a person under a child welfare law may only be brought by the child, a parent or a relative who has the daily care and control of the child or the child welfare officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Opposition does not oppose these amendments, it does have serious concerns relating to the proposed amendment to section 117C of the Act. That section provides that parties to maintenance and property proceedings in the Family Court may file and deliver offers of compromise. The existence of an offer of compromise should not be disclosed to the court except at the conclusion of the proceedings when the court comes to consider the question of costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the rules of natural justice, a judge who becomes aware of an offer of compromise during the course of proceedings must advise the parties that he or she is aware of the existence of the offer and ask whether the parties have any objection to him or her continuing to hear the proceedings and must disqualify himself or herself if there is an objection. This Bill amends section 11C to provide that a judge is not disqualified from continuing to hear proceedings only because an offer of compromise has been disclosed. It is notable that there has not so far been an adequate explanation for this departure from the rules of natural justice. Therefore I foreshadow that, unless the Minister can provide a satisfactory explanation here this evening, I will be moving in the committee stage for the deletion of this provision; in other words, that the rules of natural justice shall prevail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third Bill we wish to raise specifically and with which we have some difficulties is the Judiciary Act 1903 and in particular the amendments proposed in this Bill tonight. The Government is attempting for the third time to amend section 64 of the Judiciary Act; although, strangely enough, this interesting history is mentioned nowhere in the explanatory memorandum or in the Minister's second reading speech. The previous attempts were in the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill 1989 and then again in the Government and Government Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill 1990. The Government's aspiration for reform in this area has evidently become progressively more modest, and this time it is trying to achieve the amendment by way of this omnibus Bill. Section 64 of the Judiciary Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side as in a suit between subject and subject.</PARA>
<PARA>This section basically provides an assumption of equality between government and the citizen. It is also construed as a legislative acceptance by the Commonwealth to the application of State laws on the commencement of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, in the view of the Government, problems that flow from the operation of section 64. The mere commencement of a suit against the Commonwealth or a State means that section 64 can cause the Commonwealth or State to be bound by legislation which would not otherwise bind the Commonwealth or the State. This obviously also introduces new uncertainties that will apply to both the Commonwealth or the State in the relevant circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The 1986 High Court case of the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industry Ltd illustrates the type of problem which may arise in the operation of section 64. In that case, the court held that by reason of section 64 the Subcontractors Charges Act 1974 of Queensland applied in proceedings instituted in Queensland by a subcontractor against the Commonwealth as an employer. The High Court held in the Evans Deakin case that, where the Commonwealth or a State is carrying out an activity which ordinary members of the public carry out, the Commonwealth or the State should be subject to the same types of laws that ordinary persons would be subject to, unless the application of such laws would be incompatible with the position of the Commonwealth or detrimental to the public welfare. The High Court has also said recently that the presumption that the Crown is not generally bound by legislation has little relevance in contemporary Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's most recent attempt at legislation in this area&mdash;the Bill of 1990 to which I referred&mdash;was not acceptable to the coalition because it reversed the legislative presumption in section 64 that governments and citizens should be treated equally in litigation. The approach taken in that Bill was that the Commonwealth was subject to State and Territory law only if it opted in by way of regulation. Thus the Commonwealth would have to sift through every law of every State and Territory and choose the laws to which it would be subject, which we obviously thought was unsatisfactory. In the limited context of this objectionable legislation, the coalition preferred the opting out approach advocated by the legal profession whereby laws are presumed to apply to the Commonwealth unless it specifically opts out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the amendments now proposed go further than those proposed formerly in what was clause 15 of the previous Bill. Firstly, in litigation the Commonwealth will not be subject to State or Territory laws which would not bind the enacting State or Territory if it were involved in similar legislation. Secondly, the Commonwealth will not be liable for damages in an action for breach of a statutory duty under the provisions of a prescribed State or Territory law. The Commonwealth will be able to protect itself from an action for damages by prescribing a law by regulation. Thirdly, where a State is involved in litigation, section 64 will not give to another party any statutory rights the party would not otherwise have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have difficulty with two aspects of these proposals. First, they confer a broader immunity from section 64 on the Commonwealth than on the States. The Commonwealth will be exempted from laws which would not apply to it but for section 64. Where a State is involved, section 64 will not give a party any right under a statute that the party would not have but for section 64. Secondly, it is unacceptable to us that the Commonwealth will be able to exempt itself by way of regulation from laws of general application. We made that point when this Bill was last debated. Such an important measure should be dealt with by statute but not by delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of these concerns about the proposed amendment to the Judiciary Act, I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments in the committee stage to delete these provisions from the Bill. The Opposition's basic position is that section 64 is of fundamental importance in the rights of citizens and in Federal-State relations. Modern governments carry on business in much the same way as private enterprise and they should, as far as possible, be subject to the same laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penultimate Act I want to mention is the Trade Practices Act 1974. We do not oppose the somewhat technical amendments to section 50A of the Trade Practices Act contained therein. The last Act I want to mention is what someone has described as a further carriage to this omnibus Bill; that is, we wish to propose an amendment to the Law Officers Act 1964. We do so in light of the amazing decision of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to grant his consent to the Solicitor-General engaging in private practice at the Bar whilst on leave. It is particularly the Attorney-General's extraordinary refusal to give any explanation of the reasons for his decision to the Parliament that has prompted the Opposition to propose this amendment. The effect of the amendment would be to oblige the Attorney-General, when he gives consent under section 9 for paid work to be undertaken, to table a statement in both Houses of Parliament setting out the reasons for giving consent. I will deal with the date on which we propose that the amendment should commence in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which is an omnibus Bill containing a number of amendments. It seeks to amend the Family Law Act 1975 to widen the power of the Family Court to enable custody, guardianship, access and maintenance orders for children who are subject to State welfare legislation to be dealt with under the Family Court legislation. Since this is subject to the provision of the certificate by the child welfare officer at State level who is in charge of that particular child, the Australian Democrats do not raise any objections to it. We assume that the States will pass complementary legislation to enable the child welfare officers to issue such certificates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also seeks to amend the Family Law Act to ensure that a Family Court judge is not disqualified from hearing a case simply because the judge becomes aware that one of the parties has made an offer of settlement. I note the comments made by Senator Hill on this point. The Democrats will also be interested to hear the justification of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) for widening the common law position. On the face of it, it seems to be reasonable. I am assuming that the motivation, at least in part, is based on the desire to save parties additional costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation further seeks to amend section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 to ensure that a recent High Court decision does not result in the Commonwealth becoming liable for damages or breach of statutory duty under a State or Territory law which does not bind the State or Territory itself. In fact, the legislation contains one other provision which is not made necessary by Evans Deakin. I am referring to the proposed new subsection 2(b) which this Bill seeks to insert into the Act. This subsection would enable the Commonwealth to escape from any particular law that would cover it by regulation. The Australian Democrats would certainly not countenance that. We will be moving an amendment to knock that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we are now persuaded that the whole of section 64 should be removed from the legislation. We believe that when a law is such that a State should be subject to it but the State has passed legislation to exempt itself from the reach of that particular legislation, then it does not necessarily follow that we should allow the Commonwealth to escape as well. On that basis, we believe that if there is a valid case the Commonwealth should be in a position to pass specific legislation to escape the reach of such State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment contained in this Bill seeks to ensure that the recently passed Crimes (Investigations of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991 does not apply to State offences when they occur on Commonwealth property. One could argue that it would be useful if we had uniform provisions for the investigation of criminal offences. There is something to be said for extending the standards that have now been adopted by the Commonwealth to all States, but that should not happen by accident or by stealth. In the current period it will be interesting to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commonwealth legislation based on the principle of time limits with recently introduced Victorian legislation which is based on the principle of reasonable time. However, the Democrats will support the amendment because, as I said, it should not occur by accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill makes a technical amendment to the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Democrats do not oppose that. I make a brief comment on the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Hill. The Democrats are disposed to support it, subject to raising some concerns of privacy for the individual in that particular situation. I will address those concerns during the committee stage. </PARA>

It is also pleasing to note the indications of support for those amendments to section 5 of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 which are designed to ensure that State police, when investigating applied Commonwealth offences, are not bound by part 1C of the Crimes Act 1914.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has happened in several cases that the judge has, quite by accident, become aware of the fact that an offer has been made. He has had no knowledge of the terms of the offer, any particulars, details or  elaboration beyond merely becoming aware of the fact of the offer having been made, and the hearings have been rendered abortive. This has been of concern to the judges in the Family Court. It is a very unusual and rare occurrence; it should not occur. The family law rules require that where notice of an offer is filed in the court, it is to be kept apart from the court file. Therefore, the very fact, let alone the terms, of an offer should not become a matter of notice to the judge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe that sometimes the matter has been inadvertently disclosed with the result that the judge has felt bound to disqualify himself or herself. Of course, if this inadvertent and accidental disclosure of the fact of an offer&mdash;not the terms even&mdash;occurs at the end of a lengthy and costly proceedings, the fact that the hearing is aborted means that the parties throw away very substantial legal costs. I do not think it is of any benefit to the parties. There is a further delay in the proceedings and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what this amendment is trying to say is simply that, if all that happens is that a judge becomes aware of the fact of an offer, that should not lead to his disqualification. Of course, if he becomes aware of the terms or any further particulars or elaboration beyond the mere fact of the offer, the sorts of considerations which Senator Hill is concerned about should come into play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate to the Senate that the Family Court judges have sought to have this particular provision inserted. They believe it will not be contrary to the interests of justice and, in fact, will assist the parties in obtaining a judgment in the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the judges have felt bound&mdash;given the terms of section 117C(1), which says that `the fact and the terms of an offer shall not be disclosed to the court'&mdash;to disqualify themselves when something like that occurs. They do it as a matter of automatic subjection of their judicial office, if you like, to what appears to be the intention of the Parliament&mdash;that there shall not be a disclosure of the fact. If there is a disclosure, they feel bound to disqualify themselves. They do not see it as a matter of discretion. They see themselves as simply carrying through the intention of the Act in disqualifying themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the amendment is cast in the terms that it is. Perhaps, if we need to, we can discuss it further during the committee stage. But I indicate that this is a matter about which the judges themselves have felt concerned to bring to the attention of the Government. We are responding to the entreaty of the Family Court of Australia in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the amendments to the Judiciary Act 1903, as Senator Hill indicates, this matter has been a long and continuing saga. I do not think I need to rehearse once again the whole story of the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries in 1986. But, basically, that decision subjects the Commonwealth to a wide range of State and Territory legislation as if the Commonwealth were an ordinary person. One may say, `That's all right; that is what section 64 is all about'. But as a result of the Evans Deakin decision, section 64 can even subject the Commonwealth to State legislation which does not bind the State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Commonwealth is subject to all sorts of unforeseeable liabilities under whatever legislation the States might enact from time to time in regard to ordinary persons and which the States do not even wish to apply to themselves. But the Commonwealth is to become bound by legislation which the States are not prepared to make binding upon themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For members of the Federal Parliament to agree to a State parliament enacting legislation to bind the Commonwealth when it is not prepared to bind itself, seems to me to be pretty extraordinary. I certainly do not believe we should allow the States to decide in that respect what parts of their legislation should apply to the Commonwealth, particularly where they are not bound by it themselves. That is why our amendments are designed to subject the Commonwealth to State or Territory law where the enacting State or Territory is also bound by it. That seems to be a matter of simple fairness and equality. So I say to Senator Spindler: if the State or Territory has not seen fit to bind itself, why should the legislation be made applicable to the Commonwealth?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure of the exact scope of it. Certainly, in prudence and as a matter of caution, one would have to at least scan all of the legislation. The difficulty then is, of course, to look at the delegated legislation made under, and by reason of, the principal legislation passed by the States or Territories. It could be a very exhausting process to come to a conclusion which the honourable senator has come to&mdash;perhaps correctly and intuitively&mdash;that, in the end, nothing much would apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is another provision which says that even if a State or Territory does subject itself, the Commonwealth ought to be able to opt out. Once again, this goes more along the lines of what was suggested as a better solution to the problem when we discussed this matter a year ago. We believe that if the law which, upon examination, does appear to confer a right of action against the Commonwealth for a breach of statutory duty, is applicable to the State or Territory&mdash;and, therefore, one might say that my previous argument ought to be accepted by the Commonwealth&mdash;we would normally accept it. But if we prescribed that law&mdash;and by prescribing it, I mean by dealing with it by way of a regulation which would be disallowable in this chamber&mdash;I believe that we would be properly exercising our responsibility even, let alone our right, as a Commonwealth to say that a State law should not bind us simply by will of the State parliament. It is an extraordinary proposition that it should be the case that we should be bound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise that it would be only a reserve power; the normal situation would be to accept. There is force in what the Commonwealth judiciary&mdash;the High Court&mdash;has said. According to Senator Hill, in this day and age the idea that the Crown should be somehow aloof from the laws which normally bind citizens is a bit of an anachronistic concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, holding in reserve the capacity of the Commonwealth, subject to disallowance by this chamber, to say that a State law otherwise applicable to both the State and the Commonwealth should not apply to it seems to be a proper exercise of the sovereign rights of the Commonwealth. As to the second leg of this, the States made a very strong request that the results and the implications for them of the Evans Deakin decision be dealt with. We have also tried to do that in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill indicated that the Opposition wishes to move an amendment to the Law Officers Act 1964. No doubt we will have a considerable debate on this during the committee stage. I must say as a matter of principle&mdash;I imagine that the Australian Democrats, being a party of principle in relation to parliamentary process, would agree&mdash;that to enact this particular clause so that it becomes part of the Law Officers Act would be to retrospectively alter the statutory conditions under which the Office of the Solicitor-General was conferred on a particular person. To look at it another way, it would retrospectively alter the conditions under which that particular statutory condition operates, under which that office has been held, and with an expectation that section 9 of the Law Officers Act would be applied in accordance with its terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a proper expectation over the last six months that section 9 would apply in a particular way, if it were to be applied at all. If it was sought, the Attorney-General should exercise his discretion or give his consent in a particular situation.

In other words, if the Opposition amendment gets up, the Parliament becomes the aggrieved party, if you like, which seeks the reasons for a particular decision. Under the AD(JR) Act, an aggrieved person cannot be given reasons where the giving of those reasons would impinge on the personal affairs of a third party. The Parliament becomes the aggrieved party, the party whose decision the Opposition is challenging is the Attorney-General and the third party is the Solicitor-General.

<PARA>These amendments relate to the final subject discussed by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate); that is, the proposed amendments to the Law Officers Act 1964. Two questions are involved. The first question is the substantive change to the law that we propose; the second question is whether it should be dated to commence six months before the commencement of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the first question. I do not know that the Minister argued against that. We are proposing that a new provision be added to provide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the Attorney-General gives consent under sub-section (1), the Attorney-General must lay before each House of the Parliament, within 5 sitting days of that House after the consent is given, a statement in writing setting out the findings on material questions of fact relating to the granting of the consent, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based and giving the reasons for the consent.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we regard the giving of this consent to enable a law officer to take paid employment outside the Commonwealth whilst at the same time continuing on full payment of the Commonwealth as a very unusual circumstance. In such an unusual circumstance, the taxpayer is entitled to know the reasons why. This amendment would mean that in the future an Attorney-General who decided to give that consent would know that he would have to be accountable to the people for the reasons for making that decision. We put it, therefore, as a wholly sensible reform and a discipline upon Attorneys of the future in giving consent under the existing section 9. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second and more controversial question is whether it should be dated to commence six months before the commencement of this Act. On that issue, I say that we have put it in these terms because of the intransigence of the Minister, his refusal to account to the Parliament reasons for taking this highly unusual step and for allowing Commonwealth servants&mdash;I use that in a general term&mdash;to continue to receive Commonwealth remuneration while carrying on another business endeavour. In those circumstances of his refusal to give the people adequate reasons for this unusual course of action, we feel that we are forced to do so. We do not embark upon any retrospective change to law without careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I would like to draw it to the Minister's attention that this is not retrospective in the sense that it seeks to take away benefits or impose obligations on private citizens retrospectively. There is no benefit taken. This particular law officer does not lose the benefit that the Minister has given him under section 9 in granting his consent; nor is any further obligation imposed upon him. Rather, it is an obligation on the Minister of the Crown to account to the Parliament for the reasons that he took this highly unusual course of action. It does not, as I said, remove any benefit. In fact, I argue that it confers a benefit on the taxpayers who are, in our opinion, entitled to an explanation from a Minister in relation to the administration of a statutory office and the expenditure of public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I stay with the amendments that I have moved, notwithstanding the argument that the Minister put because, as I said, I do not think it is retrospective in the normal sense. We do not wish to intrude unduly upon the personal affairs of this particular officer or any other officers. If the Minister had perhaps accounted in one of a number of ways that I can imagine for his conduct in this instance, he may well have avoided the need for such retrospectivity. There may well be ways in which he can meet the obligation that we seek to apply without unduly intruding upon the personal affairs of the law officer concerned. That is not our wish; we do not seek that. What we do wish is that Ministers be properly accountable to the Parliament for expenditure of public moneys, particularly in most unusual circumstances. We regard this as a most unusual circumstance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the difficulties of dealing with these amendments is that they came to us rather late. I have to think about Senator Spindler's last point over the next couple of minutes as I speak on matters with which I am slightly more confident. But I do believe that this is a very ill-conceived attempt to write into a statute a means of overcoming an impasse which developed in another place, because the normal ways of holding a Minister accountable to the House of Representatives for the exercise of a particular discretion or decision-making power on his part proved&mdash;in the Opposition's view, and perhaps in Senator Spindler's view&mdash;to be less than satisfactory in getting the sorts of answers that the Opposition wanted. It is going be a very full statute book if we start to make amendments to Acts to overcome the failure of the ordinary parliamentary processes of Question Time, motions of no confidence and censure notions to elicit information from Ministers. It seems to me to be an extraordinary proposition that we should start amending the Law Officers Act because Question Time in the House of Representatives proved somewhat futile from the Opposition's point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real point I wish to make is that in relation to the substantive matter&mdash;and I hope Senator Spindler may still have some room for reconsideration&mdash;the fact is that the model which is being adopted and the very language of the amendment put forward by the Opposition is an exact replica of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act provision. What that does is enable an aggrieved person to seek reasons for a decision. What this amendment is virtually doing is saying that the Parliament in this case&mdash;certainly the Opposition and perhaps the Democrats&mdash;becomes the aggrieved person seeking from the Attorney-General not only the reasons for his decision but also the material facts upon which the decision was made, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the previous understanding of the Parliament as expressed in that particular Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, if an aggrieved person seeks reasons and those reasons, if given, would impinge on the personal affairs or business affairs of a person other than the aggrieved person, other than the person making the request, then they cannot be disclosed. This Parliament has already said that in those situations that sort of information cannot be disclosed. So there is very clearly an intention in the Parliament in the structure of the Act, which is the model for this provision, that personal affairs or business affairs of a third party ought not to be disclosed. Quite clearly, these may have been the sorts of matters which led the Attorney-General to give his consent or would lead an Attorney-General to give his consent in a particular instance on an application by the Solicitor-General of the day to take advantage of the permission available under section 9 of the Law Officers Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite incredible that the personal business affairs of a Solicitor-General could be paraded in a formal way by way of a tabling document before the Parliament. I believe not only that this could do great damage to any Solicitor-General in office from time to time but also&mdash;I ask Senator Spindler to take this into account&mdash;that many potential applicants for that office may be precluded from coming forward if they think that, on a particular matter, a very personal reason which they may give to the Attorney-General and which is sufficient and adequate to enable him to exercise power under section 9 might be tabled in the Parliament. I think this is a great disservice to the office of the Solicitor-General. I would certainly suggest that the Committee reject it on that basis alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if, despite my eloquence, Senator Spindler were minded to accept for the future the proposition put by the Opposition, that is, Opposition amendment No. 4, I maintain very strongly that to accept Opposition amendment No. 1 would be to inject a very real element of retrospectivity. There is a contract of employment&mdash;let us put it that way&mdash;between the Commonwealth and the person who occupies the office of Solicitor-General. The terms of that employment are those negotiated in part between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General; for example, as to an equality of situation between the Solicitor-General and a Federal Court judge as to certain leave entitlements and so on. But there is also a statutory element imported into that employment relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key areas of that statutory employment relationship is, of course, section 9. Any past Solicitor-General, in accepting an offer of that particular high office, would make himself well acquainted with the Law Officers Act and would make himself well acquainted with section 9. There is no way&mdash;I will be blunt&mdash;that the present occupant of the office of Solicitor-General could have anticipated as part of his employment relationship that any reason he put forward to the Attorney-General to try to encourage the Attorney-General to exercise his discretion and to consent to his engaging in the practice of a barrister or solicitor, to engage in paid employment, would be required by Parliament to be laid before it. </PARA>

The fact is that the Opposition by this amendment is formally attempting to change a statutory term of employment of the Solicitor-General.

Section 9 certainly does not provide currently for that information to be divulged, but neither does it prohibit such information being provided.

<PARA>It may be that what Senator Hill says is his aim would be sufficiently achieved if the words, `setting out the findings on material questions of fact relating to the granting of the consent, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based and' were omitted. The amendment Senator Hill is putting would then read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the Attorney-General gives consent under subsection (1), the Attorney-General must lay before each House of the Parliament, within 5 sitting days of that House after the consent is given, a statement in writing giving the reasons for the consent.</PARA>
<PARA>It may be that that would be sufficient for Senator Hill's purpose and would give the Attorney, if the matter were to be accepted by the Government in another place, and I cannot give any undertaking and I will not vote for it here&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I need to clarify something because I would not want the Committee to accept the very kind offer of Senator Hill if it were based on a slight misunderstanding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that if the amendment were accepted, in that rare instance where a judge becomes aware simply of the fact of an offer having been made&mdash;not the terms of the offer or anything else that might be prejudicial to the parties or any particular party, but in a simple unadorned situation where he or she becomes aware of the fact of an offer having been made&mdash;in the terms of the Bill, the judge is not disqualified from sitting in the proceedings. That is a clear statement: he is not disqualified. It does not confer an option or a discretion on him. It simply says that he is not disqualified. I believe that that is a very bald statement of the situation in that very simple unadorned circumstance where quite unexpectedly&mdash;as I have indicated, the court rules mean that these matters should be kept quite separate from the court file&mdash;he becomes aware of the fact.

<PARA>Amendments 3 and 5 concern section 64 of the Judiciary Act. I will be brief because the arguments were canvassed during the second reading stage. Our objections are basically that the amendments confer on the Commonwealth an immunity from section 64, which is broader than that proposed for the States, and that the Commonwealth will be able to exempt itself by way of regulation from any prescribed law of the State or Territory. In light of the comments from the High Court&mdash;it feels that section 64 is able to be interpreted in a workable way&mdash;I quote one part of the Evans Deakin judgment of the High Court:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in every suit to which the Commonwealth is a party, section 64 requires the rights of the parties to be ascertained, as nearly as possible, by the same rules of law, substantive and procedural, statutory and otherwise, as would apply if the Commonwealth were a subject instead of being the Crown . . . that result seems entirely just.</PARA>
<PARA>In most circumstances we think it is entirely just. There may be the occasional difficulty and, if that does occur, it is capable of being overcome by legislation. We would much prefer it to be overcome by legislation rather than by regulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can read the writing on the wall as far as this is concerned. I think it is very unfortunate, and I may also say that the State governments have sought the amendments which have been suggested as new subsection 64(3), to prevent section 64 from conferring rights against a State and Federal jurisdiction on the basis of the law where the Commonwealth or the State that does not otherwise apply to the State, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States have expressly asked for this amendment to be made. I believe they are quite right in thinking that there is a parallel between the case I have put, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, and their claim that Commonwealth law should not determine when State statutes will bind a State in proceedings brought by or against the State in Federal jurisdiction. This should be determined by State law. I think that is a very sound principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it appears that the chamber has become subservient to the non-elected judges of the High Court of Australia in this matter, and that is rather unfortunate. It has to be emphasised that section 64 of the Judiciary Act is a simple Act of the Parliament; it is not a constitutional provision or something which is absolutely binding on us as interpreted by the High Court of Australia, as it would be if it were a constitutional provision. I believe that to give it the exalted status which the Opposition and the Democrats wish to give it so that it becomes immutable, as interpreted by the High Court, is almost to allow the Opposition and the Democrats to substitute themselves for the people in referendum, if I may be so bold as to make even that claim at this late stage of the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the Opposition and the Democrats are thinking not in terms suitable to parliamentarians but in terms suitable to those who say that they have an absolute right either to interpret the Constitution, which should bind this Parliament, whatever we may think in subsequent sittings of the Parliament, or, as I say, virtually by way of analogy with a referendum, to determine how the Constitution will be formed by virtually elevating section 64 into the Constitution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset, in handling the Public Service Amendment Bill on behalf of the Opposition, that it is a great humiliation for what is now a very short shelf life government to be introducing this Bill at this time. It should have been introduced a long time ago because it is now the height of embarrassment for this Government to admit that it has allowed public servants, if made redundant, to have the capacity to double dip the system by taking a redundancy package and then returning to the public sector, taking former entitlements with them. Either way, life has looked pretty sweet for these individuals, all at the overburdened taxpayers' expense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill proposes a range of amendments to Part V of the Public Service Act 1922 to prevent officers employed by statutory authorities from accepting redundancy benefits and then returning to the Public Service. This will bring them into line with other public servants who have only a single option&mdash;either a redundancy package or the capacity to rejoin the Service in another job with their entitlements intact. The fact that many thousands of individuals have been legally able to take both steps has been a preposterous and absurd situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are currently some 90 statutory authorities, including the Civil Aviation Authority, Telecom, Austrade and the Health Insurance Commission, which are responsible for some 50,000 public servants, who may be placed in just such a position where they may be able to make the most of their redundancy. Staff employed by these statutory authorities are usually covered by redundancy provisions, including severance pay. Under existing mobility provisions, many officers and ex-officers of the Australian Public Service may also have the right to return to the Public Service if they are retrenched from a statutory authority. There is potential here for public servants to have two bites of the pie, that is, to take their redundancy provisions and also, at some future time, to rejoin the Public Service with their rights intact. This is nothing short of piracy on the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service is not some kind of television quiz show where the winner takes all at the sponsor's expense. We should never forget that the Australian taxpayer sponsors the Public Service. It is completely unacceptable to the Liberal and National parties that this situation was ever allowed to develop. It is shameful that this decaying Government has tolerated the state of affairs which has flourished so far. Why should those people with mobility rights benefit from the redundancy arrangements of an agency and then return to the public sector where they may either get another job with the Commonwealth or, if there is no work available, have access to further redundancy arrangements? I know personally of a number of examples where this situation has in fact occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should redundancy arrangements available to former public servants in government business enterprises and other such authorities be any more generous than for other staff in these agencies? It is no wonder this country has fallen on hard times. It is no wonder the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) attempts to muzzle Dr Hewson, as he did in the other place today, to prevent him bringing the coalition's economic reform package to the ears of all Australians. The Prime Minister knows he is sunk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Crowley)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I wonder whether honourable senators could lower their tones a little and allow Senator Chapman his hearing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your assistance, Madam Acting Deputy President. Just as this Prime Minister has allowed the rorts on the ports and the union featherbedding to go on unabated, so he has allowed this Public Service double dipping to flourish. Now he is wondering why everything is collapsing around him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is a belated and feeble attempt by the Government to apply some kind of brake to the Public Service. Preventing the duplication of redundancy benefits removes the potential for significant and unjustifiable additional costs associated with the restructuring of government business enterprises and authorities. That this Government has not jumped in sooner to stop this daylight robbery from the public purse is further confirmation that it no longer has its finger on the pulse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister claims that the objective of establishing non-Budget agencies such as government business enterprises or authorities is to provide such agencies with financial independence, which includes the opportunity to obtain benefits and savings arising from that independence. What this really means is the establishment of yet more empires, where much overlapping and decision making will abound and become entrenched, just as they have in the past. For example, in the past year the Federal Public Service took on an extra 4,000 employees, while 222,000 Australians lost their jobs through retrenchment or redundancy and for other economic reasons. With unemployment breaking the 10 per cent barrier and business across the nation going to the wall, the Public Service keeps growing. These additional 4,000 employees represent a 2 1/2 per cent increase in the Public Service work force. This is happening under the noses of other workers who have been forced to undergo real hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senior Executive Service has also undergone a facelift. It grew by 5 1/2 per cent, or about 90 jobs, all in the name of restructuring and efficiency. In the past 12 months the Department of Social Security has recorded the strongest growth. It seems there are quite a few thousand employees who have a strong hold on the unemployment industry, but these people are not recipients of the dole or welfare cheques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating-Caucus inspired recession has seen the earlier trend of successful public sector staff being lured to the private sector almost cease as the squeeze hits business hard. It is obvious that many public servants, as a result, see that they have a job for life if they stay with the Public Service. It could be argued that it is the sign of a deranged mind to believe that one has a guaranteed job for life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other Public Service costs have also increased. There has been a 100 per cent increase in the cost of staff air travel in the Attorney-General's Department alone&mdash;from $1.78m in 1988-89 to $3.72m in 1989-90. Whatever the Department puts forward as reasons for this huge leap will pale into insignificance for unemployed people and those who have been retrenched during this recession. The Public Service cannot continue to tolerate escalating costs in this way. These departments are funded by the public, and the public deserves an efficient use of resources being demonstrated. Nearly $4m worth of taxpayers' money being spent on air fares demonstrates nothing of the sort; it demonstrates nothing but insupportable excess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics has also failed to keep expenses to an acceptable level. Last year the Bureau spent about $1.5m on 67 outside consultancies. Compare that with the year before, when it spent just $679,200 on 53 consultancies. This represents a massive jump of about 121 per cent in a 12-month period. How can this Government claim to be on top of the job and have a special relationship with the Australian taxpayer if that is how it spends our money? Of the 67 consultancies engaged by the Bureau, only three were publicly advertised. This represents only 4 per cent. A further abuse of this claimed special relationship on the part of the Government is evidenced again by the Bureau's 3.8 per cent increase in staff levels. How can this Government assure taxpayers that they are getting a good deal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's attitude to its own personal staff makes it less than convincing that it means business with this Bill. Dr John Edwards, a one-time consultant to prime ministerial hopeful Paul Keating, was paid out almost $80,000 after only four months work&mdash;surely an act of scandalous self-serving on the part of this Government. Any right thinking Australian would be seriously offended that this Government pays its own political employees such largess when 10 per cent of Australians cannot even find work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office, as recently as today, has released information that highlights deficiencies in the management of information technology within the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Among other things it found that the operation of key information technology services in the Department had been jeopardised by the transfer of computer operations from Melbourne to Canberra, when 95 per cent of Melbourne-based technical staff left the Department. It further found that parliamentary oversight of the Department's management of information technology had been hindered by an excessive delay in responding to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and that a substantial waste of public money had resulted from an unsuccessful attempt to acquire a human resource management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next Liberal-National Party government, which is not very far away, will provide a dramatic and beneficial alternative to this self-serving maladministration. Our proposals for government involve a less costly but more effective public sector; one which is less intrusive but which enforces clear general laws, fairly and equally applied; and a role for government which will provide a framework of policy and law within which people can plan with confidence. The current size of government imposes an onerous burden on and costly intervention in the lives of individuals, families and businesses. The size and costs of government are excessive, and under a Liberal-National Party government will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen in many areas of the Hawke Labor Administration, there is still a requirement to target programs more effectively and reduce or abolish programs that are no longer cost effective or appropriate. Over many years, governments have increasingly and inappropriately involved themselves in the provision of goods and services that are more efficiently provided by the private sector. Public sector activities are often shielded from competition, whereas individual firms in a competitive private sector have no option but to minimise their costs and maximise efficiency if they are to prosper. This means that they must be innovative and responsive to changing demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The users of many services currently supplied by government would benefit considerably if these services were delivered by the private sector. The contracting out of such services will provide a better definition and more direct targeting of the services provided. It will also enable the level of and the need for community service obligations to be accurately assessed and to be more cost efficient. For example, research indicates that at least 20 per cent can be saved in the cost of delivering services if they are contracted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government should set the framework for action but not determine the content of action, which should as far as possible be left to individuals. The failure of government to provide such a satisfactory framework has been a central cause of Australia's recent spectacular decline. The most effective way for governments to meet that challenge in the 1990s is to create a predictable and orderly environment which will best enable individuals, families and businesses to achieve their values and plan for the future with certainty and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A government which tries to correct every social ill invariably creates more problems than it solves. The Hawke Government's ad hoc deal-driven policy interventions have meant that in many areas of national life no-one really knows what he can and cannot do. Labor has extended government by deal to the operation of many of our national institutions: it compromised the independence of the Reserve Bank of Australia when it engineered a change in bank rules to keep housing interest rates down in 1989; it has bullied, denigrated and ignored the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, whenever its decisions have diverged from the government line; and it ignored a High Court ruling on MP's postage which it found inconvenient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Hawke Labor Government, public administration has become increasingly out of touch with the needs and aspirations of the people it is supposed to serve. Politicians and officials have become too cocooned in Canberra and the Public Service has become increasingly in need of infusions of outside talent. The role of government under Labor expresses the traditional collectivist belief that Big Brother knows best. Whether the decision involves the ACTU, the Green movement or Labor's own factions, the views of the leaders are those which count and not those of the rank and file.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's compulsory training levies, compulsory superannuation, compulsory arbitration, compulsory accords and a refusal to act against compulsory trade unionism exemplify a philosophy of government which continually resorts to coercion and compulsion in order to achieve its aims; yet every compulsion undermines motivation and distorts decisions. All compulsions strike at the roots of growth and prosperity, and no democratic government should lightly resort to coercion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties believe that compulsion is justified only to ensure an equitable sharing of contributions to community well-being or to protect those members of the community who cannot look after themselves. But compulsion is always very costly. It should always be a last rather than a first resort and should never become a means of simply achieving political objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main task of government is to provide a framework of law within which people can plan their own lives in freedom and with confidence, and the framework which this country desperately requires is one which promotes prosperity and full employment. The primary role of government must be strategic and not focused on the distribution of benefits and privileges to its friends. Public policy may distinguish between activities which are equally legal. For example, it may seek to discourage smoking or encourage saving. But we should minimise distortions to maximise efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Liberal-National Party government public sector will promote freedom of contract, exposure of monopolies to competition, fair dealing and open and competitive markets as well as the acceptance of liability by market participants and promotion of the public good by cultivating individual excellence. By exposing the public sector to these forces, the performance of government and its contribution to national well-being will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Public Service is capable of being a more vital, progressive, effective and efficient force in the development of our nation. Too many of the dedicated and professional men and women in the service of Australia have become hamstrung by the controls and regulations which have multiplied under this Government. The present Government has failed to encourage the Public Service to achieve its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A coalition government will be committed to the introduction of a new management philosophy which will enable the development of a highly respected, dynamic, enterprising Public Service capable of responding to the needs of our community. The next coalition Government&mdash;which, as I said, is now not very far away&mdash;will therefore introduce a range of reforms aimed at overcoming the present inefficiencies in government, including a new management philosophy in the Public Service and ensuring that the public sector in general meets the contemporary needs of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among those reforms will be those which will provide more opportunities and incentives for achieving excellence and efficient and effective management and to make the public and private sectors more competitive. The reforms will also support the principle of a non-political career Public Service in which promotions and appointments are based on merit. Our reforms will also provide public servants as far as possible with similar terms and conditions of employment to those available in the private sector. Therefore, a coalition administration of the public sector will ensure that the sorts of rorts which have become endemic under this failed Hawke Labor Government and which this legislation belatedly seeks to remove will be decidedly a thing of the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Public Service Amendment Bill 1991 is a Bill which amends the officers mobility provisions contained in part 4 of the Public Service Act. The purpose of this Bill was described in my second reading speech: it is to remove the opportunity of double-dipping where officers of the Australian Public Service are working on secondment in agencies of the Government or in government business enterprises and where redundancies in those enterprises occur. The officers, therefore, by virtue of the carriage of this Bill, if made law, will be prevented from exercising a double dip in redundancy benefits at both the agency or the government business enterprise and, later, upon return to the Australian Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best summary of the purpose of the Bill is found in the seventh paragraph of my second reading speech. I welcome the Opposition's support of this legislation. I note that the speech in reply to the second reading speech, which was just delivered by Senator Chapman, has not really confined itself to the limits of the legislation before the chamber. Certainly, Senator Chapman made a few remarks about that. Those remarks were unfavourable to the Government; that is what one would expect of an Opposition and I am not surprised by any of that. Nonetheless, the Opposition is supporting this legislation and the Government welcomes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the remainder of the remarks made by the Opposition are best characterised as an ideological rave. Buoyed up by the enthusiasm of the `Frightpack' that was released by Dr Hewson last week, we had the ebullient enthusiasm of the Opposition demonstrated today in a more unruly Question Time than normal as it pressed the so-called merits of its case. That is the role of an Opposition and one acknowledges it. Thank God; it is about time. Question Time in this place was a bit more exciting today than it has normally been over the last few months. Some of us on the front bench have almost dozed off, given the somnolent nature of the Opposition's attack on us over the past few months. We welcome a chance to sharpen our act and we thank the Opposition for performing a bit better today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do not propose to embark on a comprehensive reply to this ideological wandering by Senator Chapman, other than to say these things, quickly and in summary. The most far reaching reform of the Australian Public Service is the reform that has been enacted under this Government. That is acknowledged; the authorities on the subject of public sector reform acknowledge that. It has been a reform through which we have devolved more responsibilities to the departments to have greater control and say over the management of the affairs within their portfolios. We have introduced program budgeting and we have insisted upon the establishment of performance indicators so that efficiency and productivity can be measured against objective criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Public Service is now regarded by other public services in the world as being among the world's best, in terms of its efficiency and productivity. We have provided a degree of commercialisation of sections of the Public Service and we have, where appropriate, invited outside contracting of some of the things performed within the Public Service. But we have not made a fetish of those things. We have done them in recognition of the fact that the process is not an end in itself. Commercialisation is not some token god which is an end in itself; its purpose is to make the service more efficient and to deliver a better quality service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of quality may be separate from that of price. The cost of delivering a public service is one thing; the quality of it is quite another. It is more difficult to judge the second of those two criteria and it is more simplistic and easier to judge the first. But we have insisted on delivering both. I will make the other observation that is invited by the comments which have been made here this evening, that neither I nor the Government believes one can run the health or welfare services of Australia by contracting them into private hands. There is a clear role for the public sector. They are two areas in which that role is very clear, and that is in great contradistinction to the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many things one could go to in this debate but, as I have said, they are not related to the precise purposes of this legislation. I do not want anyone to think that my cutting short of my remarks is anything to do with a lack of argument. It certainly is not. But I do think this chamber should be as the Australian Public Service has increasingly been recognised as being, that is, a bit more efficient in the passage of Bills. Therefore, I will not debate any further. I commend the Opposition for its support and I commend the Bill to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill 1991 implements Australia's part in giving effect to decisions taken at the ninth general review of IMF quotas. That review took place in 1990, and this is the enactment of Australia's involvement in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that 1990 review Australia joined a consensus of member countries of the IMF to, firstly, increase quotas in order to enhance the capacity of the IMF to provide effective assistance and, secondly, to strengthen the measures available for use against member countries in arrears with their accrued obligations to the IMF. That essentially involves the suspension of voting and associated rights of the offending members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed increase in Australia's quota is from $2.8 billion to $4 billion, an increase of some 44 per cent. That contribution compares with the increase in members' quotas as a whole by 50 per cent, so our increase is somewhat less than the aggregate overall increase. The reason for the increase is to help augment the International Monetary Fund's financial resources. Those have been placed under considerable pressure by drawings required by member countries since the previous review of quotas that occurred seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Augmenting the IMF in this way will allow it to continue to provide temporary balance of payments assistance to members experiencing weak external positions and, in so doing, will help to promote a more stable international monetary system. That, of course, has been one of the basic objectives of the International Monetary Fund since its establishment as one of the so-called Bretton Woods twins after the Second World War&mdash;the other twin, of course, being the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development which is now known as the World Bank. Australia has always been a strong supporter of those Bretton Woods twins, and I think we have always been a respected member of both institutions. So far as the International Monetary Fund is concerned, we have always been a contributor to the Fund and never, to my knowledge, have we drawn on its resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the way things are going in Australia at the moment, unless our external position improves substantially, it is conceivable that the day will come when we have to go cap in hand to the IMF for financial assistance. I hope we can avoid that. Unless we change direction in this country, the prospect of that cannot be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the immediate term, the increase in our quota does not represent a drain on our resources because it is essentially the substitution of one asset for another on the national balance sheet. The foreign currency and special drawing rights, or SDRs as they are commonly called, purchased from the Reserve Bank and deposited with the International Monetary Fund, count as part of our international reserve assets, as they did prior to the transaction. The advantage of the substitution of assets for Australia is that by depositing funds with the International Monetary Fund the asset is augmentable in the event of an exchange rate crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's large and persistent current account deficit is a matter of great concern to Australia and to the economy as a whole. It is something that the Government, with its present approach and its policy paralysis, is incapable of correcting. The Government caused the problems that we have, but it does not seem to be in a position to solve them. If the insidious current account deficit is being held down&mdash;it has fallen somewhat over the last year or so but is still extraordinarily and dangerously high by all past standards&mdash;it is occurring by strangulation rather than a healthy competitive economy. This continuing major deficit in our balance of payments has led to a vast build-up in our net foreign liabilities. That, of course, is to the detriment of future generations. Those liabilities are drawing on our resources of the future and, therefore, it is our children and grandchildren who will be left to fix the debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last five to six years the current account deficit has hovered around 4 to 5 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1989-90, it was 6 per cent of GDP and that percentage was the highest in the developed world. As our current account deficit has increased, there has been more than a fivefold increase in our foreign liabilities, counting both debt and equity. At the last count, those foreign liabilities stood at no less than $176 billion. They increase by about $1 billion every month as the bad news on our external account front continues to roll in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of servicing our net foreign liabilities is now running at about $17 billion per year. That is in the order of 4 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product; it is about 25 per cent of our total export earnings. For every dollar in exports that we earn through wheat, wool or whatever other commodity or service we export, 25c in every dollar is going simply to meet our debt obligations. As such, it is a massive drain on the economy and a major reason for the erosion of living standards and the associated loss of jobs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate the impact of the high cost of servicing<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">our foreign debt liabilities, just consider the boost which would occur to employment if there were a 4 1/2 per cent boost to our gross domestic product. They are the sorts of magnitudes that we are talking about. That is the perspective in which this debt obligation needs to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic cause of this burgeoning current account deficit and the consequent build-up in foreign liabilities has been the persistent trend of too much domestic spending relative to our ability to produce. That is not to say that our demand is necessarily high by international standards. More to the point, it is that our productivity is depressingly low. We are inefficient in many things we do. To our regret, and to the real shame of this Government, most of the reasons for our inefficiencies are the result of Government inaction or, more to the point, the Government's fear to act lest it might have to face up to the electoral consequences of upsetting a few of its mates in influential and privileged positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission and the Business Council of Australia have, in recent research, indicated that with the proper structural reform of our economy, at least a 15 per cent increase in our gross domestic product could be achieved. In other words, our gross domestic product could be permanently increased by at least $60 billion if the necessary reform measures were taken. Those reforms lie right across the board of infrastructure industries in Australia&mdash;the areas of domestic water transport, bulk commodity handling, international shipping, rail transport, domestic aviation, international aviation, road transport, post and telecommunications, electricity supply, rural and manufacturing assistance, water services, contracting out, labour market reform, and capital productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the inefficiencies in those areas were tackled seriously, there would be a $60 billion boost to our gross domestic product, if one can believe the studies of the highly respected Industry Commission and also the studies commissioned by the Business Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the excess consumption relative to production coin is that there has been too little saving and, accordingly, too little investment. As inevitably follows, there has been an abysmal performance in the productivity stakes, as I mentioned earlier, and a consequent loss in international competitiveness. The domestic spending binge really stemmed from the expansionist policy of the Hawke Government when it first took office in 1983. `Expansionist' is, of course, often another word for `soft touch' or `do anything to stay in power even if it wrecks the country'. That was precisely the policy approach taken by this Government in its early years. We have been living with the disastrous consequences of that ever since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main factors that were pushing domestic demand in those early days were of course the Keating Budget deficits from 1983-84 through to 1985-86. It is often forgotten that the size of those deficits in those years and the rate of increase in government spending in real terms matched fairly well the enormous excesses in government spending that occurred during the three years of the Whitlam Labor Government, which excesses of course set in train many of the fundamental problems with which we have been grappling unsuccessfully ever since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those Keating Budget deficits produced a huge financing requirement, and that was rapidly translated into monetary expansion, higher inflation, current account deficits, and a rapid increase in the funds owed to foreign lenders and equity holders. When that damage had been done, the perpetrator himself, namely, the then Treasurer and now ex-Treasurer, Mr Keating, declared that Australia faced the prospect of becoming a banana republic. That was certainly the case, and it still remains the case. The thing that should never be forgotten is that the duo of policy developers and architects of that situation were the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the former Treasurer, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the second half of the 1980s the effects of the dramatic overheating of the economy had come home to roost. It was an overheating which was entirely due to irresponsible economic management and the irresistible temptation of the Government to fiddle with the economic levers for short term political gain. The artificially overheated economy saw a surge in private investment but, in response to the signals of the time, that investment went into property speculation and takeovers. Very little of it went into productive plant and equipment. The Government was entirely at fault because interest rates were maintained too low for too long on top of a surge in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the lending binge went on and the current account deficit blew out to 6 per cent of GDP in 1989. We were in a dreadful upward spiral that inevitably had to burst. This brought about the devastation of jobs, output and living standards that we have been witnessing in the last two years. During this time we have suffered the most severe recession in Australia in the last 60 years. None of those current problems should have been experienced. They were all due to the major policy miscalculations by Prime Minister Hawke and ex-Treasurer Keating that occurred in the middle and late 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having caused the problem within appropriate fiscal and monetary policies and being incapable of making any worthwhile micro-economic reforms to reduce the cost of doing business in Australia, the Government then resorted to murderously high interest rates. Business rates were over 20 per cent for over a year in an attempt to kill demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with this fascination for deceiving the Australian people, the Government perpetrated the view&mdash;we will never forget this; it was put around publicly just before the last election by both the Prime Minister and ex-Treasurer Keating&mdash;that, firstly, there would be no recession and, secondly, even when that falsehood was revealed, there would in fact be a soft landing. The truth, of course, is that that policy created a vicious cycle and the most severe recession for 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the mess that Labor has made of the Australian economy, it was not inconceivable that the IMF may have been brought in by Australia's creditors to put the house in order. I am referring to the 1980s generally. In 1986, for example, there was a very rapid depreciation of the exchange rate. That was at the time of the banana republic statements by the ex-Treasurer. It was at a time when Australia faced a major external crisis&mdash;a crisis that essentially has continued ever since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the exchange rate was allowed to float was no doubt one of the reasons that the IMF was prepared to wait and see what happened rather than intervene in our internal situation. Subsequently, the fact that the Budget was brought into balance and then into surplus at the end of the decade was sufficient to maintain credibility with the international financial community, although we suffered and continue to suffer in terms of reduced international credit ratings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inherent problem remains: we are still a country at very high risk. The ratio of foreign liabilities to GDP is still rising. Overcoming that problem requires radical change. There is no way we are going to get out of our present problems by tinkering at the edges or by incremental change. Overcoming our problems requires radical change. The essence of the task is that in order to stabilise our foreign liabilities as a proportion of GDP we need to shift at least 4 per cent of economic activity into the tradables sector. That translates to a 25 per cent increase or thereabouts in net exports. That shift from the domestic to the external sector has never, in our postwar period, been achieved in any one year, let alone been sustained for a period of years, and it is that that is required simply to stabilise the existing level of debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have an enormous task ahead of us. Achieving that target will require a massive increase in productivity in order to become competitive on world markets. Only the types of measures that are contained in the coalition's set of proposals that were launched last week, the Fightback proposals&mdash;only measures of that order of magnitude and that order of change to our existing circumstances&mdash;will lead us towards the achievement of that goal. It is the only hope for Australia to make dramatic and radical change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, it is no good tinkering at the edges. We have been doing that for decades and look where it has got us: it has got us on a downward slippery slope scale of international comparative living standards; it has produced massive unemployment and hardship in this nation. The sooner we realise the magnitude of the task ahead of us the better. The longer we delay making the changes of the type that have been outlined by the coalition in its dramatic proposals, released in recent days, the more intractable our problems will become and the less opportunity there will be to have the hope and the vision and the jobs that Australia and Australians so desperately crave. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the hour is late but there are some important details I want to address in my response to the International Monetary Fund Bill. This is not a contentious Bill and it is supported by the Australian Democrats. The Bill proposes two amendments to the principal Act, that is, the International Monetary Agreement Act 1947. These are an increase in Australia's quota in the International Monetary Fund and an alteration to the rules of the IMF concerning the voting rights of member countries who are in arrears to the IMF.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMF was established to promote international monetary cooperation. It provides temporary financing to member countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties. It also seeks to promote orderly exchange arrangements, a multilateral payment system free from restrictions, and international monetary cooperation generally. Australia has been a member since 1947, with total current membership being 155 countries. The fund is controlled by a board of governors which comprises representatives of all member nations and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) is Australia's representative. There is also an interim committee of the board of governors which comprises 22 members, either representing their own interests or those of a particular constituency. Membership of this interim committee arises if a country is entitled to an executive director's position on the executive board of the fund. Since 1948 Australia has represented our constituency of Pacific and Asian nations on the executive board and, hence, has been a member of the interim committee of governors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each member of the fund is assigned a quota, which determines its financial and organisational relations with the fund. Quotas determine members' subscriptions, their relative voting power, their access to fund financing, and their shares in allocations of special drawing rights, which I shall refer to as SDRs. The SDR is an international reserve asset created by the IMF. These are allocated to member countries, who can hold them as international reserves or use them in a variety of transactions with the IMF. The value of the SDR is calculated as a weighted basket of the five major currencies. The Commonwealth Government has transferred its SDRs to the Reserve Bank, less net charges of the IMF payable by the Commonwealth. As at 30 June this year, Australia had 131,738,522 SDRs, valued at over $226m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The usual financial transactions which Australia undertakes are, firstly, the maintenance of value obligations to the fund. If the value of a member's currency varies against the SDR during the year, the member country must adjust the fund's holding of its currency. For the year ended 30 April 1990, Australia had to pay the IMF almost $140m as a maintenance of value payment. Secondly, participation in operational budgets is necessary to provide domestic currencies in exchange for other currencies to assist the fund needs of the fund. Operational budget transactions affect only the composition, not the level, of a country's international reserve assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there are three categories of transactions in special drawing rights. Firstly, designation plans identify those countries with sufficiently strong external positions that are called upon to provide foreign currencies in exchange for SDRs from countries with weak external positions. The IMF levies charges on the SDRs that have been allocated to member countries and pays interest on those SDRs that are held by each member. As Australia's actual SDR holdings are well below our maximum allocation, we must pay an annual amount to the fund. In 1989-90, this amounted to over 20 million SDRs. In addition, an annual assessment to cover the administration is payable. This was over 94,000 SDRs in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, if the fund's holdings of a member's currency fall below a certain level, the fund pays remuneration to the member for the use of its currency. In 1989-90, Australia received remuneration of nearly six million SDRs. So the aggregate size of quotas and their distribution are key elements in the operation of the IMF. Consequently, the articles of agreement provide for a general review of quotas at intervals of not more than five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the Senate tonight seeks to implement the general quotas that apply to member countries as agreed under the ninth general review of quotas. This review commenced in March 1987 and was completed in June 1990. The resolution adopted by the board of governors on that date provides for an aggregate quota increase of 50 per cent. This is the same increase as occurred in the seventh and eighth general reviews, which were completed in 1978 and 1983 respectively. This will augment the IMF's financial resources which, according to the speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), have been `placed under considerable pressure by the drawings made by member countries since the last general review of quotas some seven years ago'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's allocation increase was proposed at 44 per cent. This Bill seeks to implement that proposal. This will leave Australia at the same relative ranking within the IMF&mdash;that is, a ranking of thirteenth. The increase will come into effect before 31 December this year if members accounting for at least 85 per cent of existing quotas consent to their respective increases before that date. They must also accept the other proposals in this Bill concerning member countries that are in arrears to the IMF, and I will deal with them later. The proposed increase in Australia's quota is from about $2.8 billion to about $4 billion. Clause 5 of the Bill authorises the Treasurer to consent to this increase on behalf of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financing of this obligation is a complex one which will not affect the Budget deficit. It is characterised as a financing or below the line transaction in our complex system of public accounting. In any event Australia will not be sending a cheque for $1.2 billion to the IMF this year. The method of payment is provided for in the IMF articles of agreement and the ninth quota review resolution approved by the board of governors. Of the additional quota subscription, 75 per cent will be paid in Australian dollars and the remainder in SDRs and foreign currency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 allows the Australian dollar component&mdash;75 per cent of the increase in the quota&mdash;to be paid in the form of a non-negotiable and non-interest-bearing security. The issue of this security will not affect the Consolidated Revenue Fund. It is a promise to pay the IMF in Australian dollars if the Fund needs more Australian currency than it holds. The second reading speech states that the likelihood of the IMF actually calling in this security is remote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 7 of the principal Act establishes the general use of and standing appropriation for securities issued under clause 6. The foreign currency and SDRs required will be purchased by the Commonwealth from the Reserve Bank of Australia. Clause 7 of this Bill authorises an appropriation for the purpose of purchasing of foreign currency and the SDRs will be purchased under the standing appropriation of sub-section 5A(6) of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter covered by this Bill is a set of proposals to alter the IMF's articles of agreement. These are known as the third amendment and were adopted by the board of governors to strengthen the IMF's capacity to deal with members who are consistently in arrears to it. The term `third amendment' refers to the fact that this is the third time the IMF's articles of agreement will be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment arose in July 1966 because Ministers from the G10 nations agreed to create additional reserve assets in the Fund at some time in the future. After the consideration of many options, the first agreement entered into force on 28 July 1969, establishing a new facility based on special drawing rights and making other changes to Fund rules and practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the years of paying special attention to the problems of the less developed member countries, including setting up the group of 24, which includes a geographically representative cross-section of less developed countries, the second amendment came into force in April 1978. The amendments related to the exchange arrangements, the reduced role of gold in the IMF and making the special drawing right the principal reserve asset of the Fund. At 30 April 1991, nine members had accumulated overdue obligations of more than $US5.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed third amendment changes to the IMF articles are as follows: firstly, the suspension of voting and associated rights of members in arrears would be a compulsory step interposed between a declaration of ineligibility and a compulsory withdrawal; secondly, a 70 per cent majority of the executive board would be required to impose or terminate such a suspension; thirdly, a suspended member would lose the right to vote in any organ of the Fund on most amendments to the articles and in elections of officials; fourthly, the governor or alternate governor of a suspended member would immediately cease to hold office; and, fifthly, the executive director representing a suspended member would lose office though, if also representing other non-suspended members, would be eligible for re-election by those other members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that these measures will reduce the amount of arrears outstanding to the IMF, all other members, including Australia, will directly benefit by lower costs. It is also claimed that Australia and other members will benefit indirectly from a stronger IMF which can obtain more consistent adherence by members to their obligations. The IMF provides general financial assistance to states. Eligibility depends on national need, which is evidenced by poor current account performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this, a variety of international agencies provide specific project related aid to less developed nations. Australia is involved in many, but not all, of these international agencies. The most well known of these is the World Bank group. Another international development agency of which Australia is a member is the recently established European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which will provide assistance to the former Eastern Bloc nations and the former USSR to convert their economic systems to market oriented ones. I wish them luck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer gives an annual report on Australia's participation in the World Bank's activities and the assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of those activities pursuant to section 7 of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Act 1989, as well as the annual report required by section 10 of the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last tabled report on Australia's participation in the World Bank relates to the year ended 30 June 1990. The report incorrectly states that Australia was not a signatory to the ICSID Convention as at 30 June. This report arose on the initiative of former Democrats Senator Macklin, who was concerned that the World Bank group's activities did not sufficiently take into account the problem of environmental degradation and the rights of indigenous groups affected by development activities and that the original report under the Monetary Agreements Act did not adequately report on these and other matters such as success in poverty alleviation and the efficiency of the group's activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important at this point to remember that the various arms of the World Bank group operate to provide finance or to provide guarantees to financiers on behalf of member countries on a project basis rather than the general assistance provided by the IMF. Thus the bank group operates at the micro level while the IMF operates more at the macro level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows that between 1965 and 1985 average per capita consumption in developing countries rose by over 70 per cent in real terms; average life expectancy increased from 51 to 62 years; and primary school enrolment rates increased from 73 to 84 per cent. Despite these achievements, over one billion people or one-third of the developing world still live in poverty in 1990 and the number is now on the increase again. More than half of these people&mdash;about 600 million &mdash;live in extreme poverty; that is, they struggle to meet the minimum needs of life. These people are concentrated in South and East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, as are the bulk of the world's poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that Australia's foreign aid performance must be judged. The Prime Minister has stated his goal&mdash;his cliched goal these days&mdash;of making Australia the clever country, but his Government's foreign aid record has certainly made Australia the mean or miserly country. The United Nations target for foreign aid for developed countries is 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product, although few nations achieve this. The Scandinavian nations and some oil rich Middle Eastern states are the exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our recent performance in foreign aid is nothing short of a disgrace. The boom years of the deregulation decade of the 1980s saw a consumption binge by the rich and powerful and the coining of a new term&mdash;`conspicuous consumption'. During this period, fast money and the relative decline of the Anglo-Saxon world, especially in trading terms, saw Australia's foreign aid decline from the reasonable levels of the Fraser Government&mdash;about 0.51 per cent of GDP&mdash;to the pitiful level of 0.33 per cent in 1990. The estimated allocation this financial year is marginally better at 0.35 per cent of GDP. That is exactly half the level the United Nations recommends and only one-third of the level that the Australian Democrats would like to see as a long term goal. This has occurred at the time that we are supposed to be integrating into our region&mdash;the region that undoubtedly contains the majority of the poorest people in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our alternative Budget put forward proposals to raise our aid allocation by an additional $420m, which would raise our contribution to the still inadequate level of 0.45 per cent of GDP. Our proposals will emphasise locally initiated and controlled cooperative programs which contribute to the alleviation of poverty, ecological sustainability, the special needs of women, and indigenous people's rights. In addition, global environmental concerns would be addressed in the areas of population, family planning and rainforest protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the legacy of colonisation and the historical exploitation of the developing world by the Western nations, the poorer countries now have the insurmountable obstacle of massive foreign debt. This Parliament recently considered this problem in the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Third World Debt; An Australian View</EMPHASIS>, which was delivered by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in November 1989. This report concluded that Third World debt problems have been severe and chronic since the beginning of the 1980s, particularly in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. There is no single cause of the problem. The crisis of the early and mid-1980s arose because the optimistic forecasts relating to servicing costs and commodity prices were not realised. As well, there was the combination of reckless lending by many Western institutions and reckless borrowing by many nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the 1970s, Western banks' involvement with the less developed countries was limited to short term trade financing, loans to countries in conjunction with IMF stabilisation programs and some project related loans. The less developed nations basically relied on finance from foreign governments and from the international development agencies. The total debt owed to private banks in 1971 was 7 per cent of the foreign debt of the less developed nations. The level since that time has increased to about 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first oil price shock produced massive balance of payments imbalances between the OPEC nations, which enjoyed huge surpluses, and the rest of the world. There was a significant fear that the OPEC nations would not reinvest this money, thus creating a capital shortage in both the developed and less developed nations, which may even have led to a world depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Poland experienced a foreign debt crisis in 1981, and in August 1982 the Mexican finance Minister announced that his country could not meet its debt servicing payments. This was crucial because Mexico was an oil exporter and had been regarded as the best credit risk of the less developed nations. Loans to several other countries had to be rescheduled and there was genuine fear that a general debt moratorium could wipe out some of the largest Western financial institutions with a consequent collapse of the international monetary system. At this point the IMF intervened and imposed a series of economic policy conditions on Mexico and, later, Brazil. In return, rescheduling of obligations was negotiated. This was not a philanthropic exercise, but merely a realisation that payment could not be made when it became due but could possibly be accommodated at a future time.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1982 to 1990 there has been a net transfer of $334 billion from the Third World to the first. Literally, the rich are getting richer and the poor are financing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the bank lent over $20 billion last year, the actual net disbursements plummeted from $11.6 billion to $7.8 billion. The new concern is that although loans are expected to increase next year to about $30 billion, a lot of this will go to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and that the extreme poverty in Asia and Africa will not be alleviated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human and environmental cost of this result is enormous. Poor nations are forced to unsustainably exploit their natural resources, especially forest resources, to obtain funds to service their debt. This in turn increases supply, which depresses the prices obtained for the commodity. In addition, since almost any development project must be pursued to raise foreign exchange to pay the interest on their foreign debt, poorer nations have become pollution havens, accepting those projects which would not be allowed in the wealthier nations. So we see the intrinsic link between environmental degradation and poverty, with excessive foreign debt being the catalyst to both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the environment movement, through the then head of the World Wildlife Fund, Dr Thomas Lovejoy, proposed the idea of debt for nature swaps.

In 1987 the first debt for nature swap went ahead in Bolivia. This was followed by swaps in Ecuador, Costa Rica, the Philippines, Madagascar, Zambia and the Dominican Republic. Although all of these have been worthwhile exercises, the scale is still small. Total swaps as at 1990 stood at only $26m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Kernot has already outlined, the Australian Democrats will be supporting the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill 1991. My purpose in speaking is to place on record some concerns about the conditions which the IMF attaches to its assistance and loans to developing countries. As the Senate is aware, one of the International Monetary Fund's prime objectives is to assist countries which run into difficulties over their external accounts. The IMF understandably perceives that it has a duty to see that a country, with an external deficit problem which is drawing on IMF reserves, is operating its economy in a way which meets with the approval of the organisation's board of directors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past decade or so, this concept has blossomed into conditionality, which refers to the terms the fund attaches to the use of its financial resources.  It is this concept of conditionality and the methods which the IMF uses to exercise its overseeing role which have worried a number of international aid groups in recent years. The IMF tells us that in exercising its overall supervisory role it is merely fulfilling financial commitments to its own members and this is as it should be. In most cases, this does not cause too many problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to IMF funds is based on formulas and a country which is borrowing need only be willing to cooperate with the IMF in working out solutions to its balance of payments problems. However, in certain instances where a country borrows a great deal of money, or up to 75 per cent of its own IMF quota, the IMF will place additional conditions on the loan. The disadvantage is in the conditions which are attached to that loan. Usually it will mean that the IMF will present a borrowing nation with a written program for correcting that country's balance of payments problems. Often these problems require major policy commitments on the part of the nation's government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade or so the criticism has been made that these conditions are based on a standardised framework that pays little attention to the specific circumstances of each individual country. This has clearly resulted in a number of problems for developing countries. In some cases, the loan arrangements have concentrated on balance of payments problems to the exclusion of any other factors peculiar to that nation's economic growth and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most seriously, in the case of developing nations in particular, the strict conditions which the IMF places on its lending programs can lead to an overall reduction in the standard of living of the population. From Egypt and Jamaica in the late 1970s, to Venezuela and Trinidad in the late 1980s, and a host of other countries in between, the world has witnessed a strong reaction to the IMF and its financial programs. The price effects of devaluation, the reduction in subsidies and the increases in indirect taxes which follow the IMF recommendations to cut back a developing country's fiscal deficit often lead to high price increases in the basic consumer goods in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This invariably penalises the more vulnerable and poorer members of society. Consequently, while loans in many instances may not be used for the direct benefit of the people, the burden of servicing these loans lies squarely on the shoulders of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who are concerned about these developments argue that the industrialised world, which is dominant in the IMF's decision making processes, should be less rigid and dogmatic in the assistance programs it forces on to the less developed nations. It is encouraging that in more recent years the IMF has been attaching greater importance to collaborating with member countries in looking at ways to improve the design of programs to protect the poorest segments of a developing country's population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this, the Australian Democrats along with a number of other community groups, particularly aid agencies, argue that much more could be done at the senior levels of the IMF to improve its policy and decision making processes. To this end, I will be moving an amendment to the second reading of this Bill requesting that the Federal Government take action to broaden the selection process for the positions which Australia holds at the IMF. One of the problems with the IMF has been that those serving on the board of governors in the position of executive director often come with a very specialised financial or economic view of how the world operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, Australia's position at the IMF has usually been filled by someone from Treasury. As with the positions Australia holds on similar institutions, such as the International Development Fund, it is possible that an officer with foreign affairs, trade or aid experience will be able to provide some useful insights into how the IMF can improve the structuring of its financial assistance packages and, in doing so, limit the adverse impacts on the populations of those developing countries in need of the assistance. The Australian Democrats' second reading amendment also urges the Government to call on the International Monetary Fund to improve its decision making processes on loan assistance programs by carrying out an environment and poverty impact statement in conjunction with that package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note here that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its report of November 1989 on Third World debt, which has just been mentioned by Senator Kernot, recommended a similar course of action. It recommended that the International Monetary Fund should be required to prepare social impact statements in respect of country adjustment programs that it initiates. On page 48 of that report, the Committee explains the reasons why such a proposal should receive Government support. On this basis, I look forward to the support of all sides in the Senate and now move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address briefly a particular issue which is relevant to the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill. The Bill increases Australia's contribution to the IMF by 44 per cent through the issue of a non-negotiable and non-interest bearing security. The IMF provides direct financial assistance as well as finance to specific projects mainly through the World Bank group. In this connection, I direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children. Australia endorsed the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children at the World Summit for Children on 30 September 1990. Prime Minister Hawke signed the declaration on 13 May 1991. The declaration states in paragraph 19:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ourselves hereby make a solemn commitment to give priority to the rights of children, to their survival and to their protection and development. This will ensure the well-being of all societies.</PARA>
<PARA>The plan of action for implementing the declaration states in part, in paragraph 34(iii):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each country is urged to re-examine in the context of its particular national situation, its current budget, and in the case of donor countries, their development assistance budgets, to ensure that programs aimed at the achievement of goals for the survival, protection and development of children will have a priority when resources are allocated. Every effort should be made to ensure that such programs are protected in times of economic austerity and structural adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA>In a letter dated 24 June to a constituent concerned about this issue, Mr Stickney, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Neal Blewett, boasted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia recently cosponsored a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly . . . which urges donor countries to assist developing countries to achieve the objectives of the Declaration.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within Australia, it is intended that an inter-Departmental Committee will be formed to develop a national Plan of Action in response to the Declaration. This Plan will be finalised by the end of 1991. Future expenditure issues will, of course, be addressed in the context of the 1991/92 budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Could the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development advise the Senate whether Australia intends to discharge this responsibility through the project-specific financial assistance through the World Bank group?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill 1991. The second reading debate has provided an opportunity for honourable senators to range fairly widely, in terms of both domestic economic policy and their views about international equity matters and overseas aid. In a sense, quite a lot of the debate strayed a long way from the Bill and even the IMF; but, nevertheless, there were some worthwhile contributions. I thought Senator Short, from time to time, did give us a fairly articulate exposition of classical 1970s economics, which I suppose is appropriate for one of the people who have advocated a sort of `back to the future' economic policy. I am sure that the Australian public would be fascinated to hear him saying that interest rates were kept too low for too long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, when we are talking about the International Monetary Fund we are talking about one of the major international financial institutions, of which Australia has been, and remains, a respected and effectively participating member. As a result of a long period of negotiation culminating in the meetings of the interim committee of the IMF in 1990, there were agreements about quota increases and amendments to the articles which have subsequently been reflected in this legislation. If the international pattern of developments continues, it is likely that both the increase in the quota and the amendments&mdash;because one is contingent upon the other&mdash;will come into effect by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is the agreed background to both the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Free), who introduced the Bill in the House of Representatives, and the contributions of honourable senators. The broad substance of the matters have been debated. I will merely respond to the amendment and I will respond very briefly to Senator Spindler's point, although I have to say I will not be able to contribute much by way of a speech during the second reading debate in answer to the questions he has raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment moved by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Australian Democrats is really a matter that relates more particularly to issues that have been of concern with regard to the World Bank, rather than the IMF. That is not to say that it has no relevance to the IMF; I understand the concern that people have, and I will come back to that in a moment. Australia's relationship with the World Bank has been a major issue of debate internationally and in the aid movement in Australia, both in terms of this and the other international financial institutions&mdash;in particular, the Asian Development Bank and also the EBRD, to which Senator Kernot referred&mdash;as to how we choose our executive and/or alternative executive directors and as to their views about the environment and the poverty impact of the policies of those international financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is probably aware of it, but I reiterate that this Government has, in the last few years, changed the way in which executive and/or alternative executive directors have been selected. I express it like that because in some institutions we do not have both positions. In the World Bank, for example, we do not have both an executive director and an alternative executive director, because we represent a broader grouping of nations. One of the positions is usually held by a representative of one of the other nations in our group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have opened up the positions of World Bank and ADB executive directors and alternates to open advertisement. The recent selection of Australia's executive director to the ADB went to a non-Treasury person. So that process is under way. I believe that is the appropriate process, and I welcome the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not keen to see the amendment carried at this stage. I think it is a matter we should debate in the Senate, and there will be the alternative forum for that when the World Bank and the IMF reports by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) come down as required by legislation. Those reports will be tabled this session and there will then be the opportunity for honourable senators to express a view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some sympathy with, and I know a number of honourable senators on both sides of the chamber support, the thrust of both points in the amendment. Certainly I have long advocated that with regard to the selection of our executive director of the World Bank, but the IMF is a very different institution from the World Bank. It has a much narrower focus. It is much more directly a financial institution rather than the World Bank, which is fundamentally a development institution. Very broadly, I guess it is described as an aid institution. The IMF is an institution for the management of the international monetary system. So the narrower, more financial economic focus of selection of representatives for Australia at the IMF is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comment about the wording of this amendment is that Australia does not actually have executive directors and alternative executive directors of the IMF. There is a group of nations, of which we are a member, which has executive directors and alternative executive directors. We are not entirely at liberty to choose just anybody we like. We have to have somebody who is acceptable to the representatives of those countries. It is not an Australian executive director; it is a person chosen to represent the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the largest member and usually has the executive director, but not always. Australia will not always, or certainly very rarely, have both the executive and alternate. I think we need to consider how we go about it. It is not impossible. We have done</PARA>
<PARA>something similar in the World Bank. I do not want to exaggerate the difficulty or problem with that. It is a bit of a wording problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do want to talk about the environment and poverty issues which are more important at the World Bank than at the IMF. However, once again, I do not say it is of no significance because the extended structural adjustment financing packages are important and can have important domestic economic consequences for the countries entering into those agreements. But it is different from the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the more appropriate forum to debate these quite important points that Senator Bourne and Senator Kernot have raised will be in the debate on those two reports when they come down. I reiterate the assurance that they will be brought down this session. If it is so late that we cannot facilitate a debate immediately, we will make some arrangement to ensure there is the opportunity for debate on those reports as soon as possible thereafter. I have already been approached by some Government senators about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler, as I think he acknowledged, was a little bit off the point in his remarks on this Bill. He seized the opportunity, but I cannot give him any information. He may want to follow up with me subsequently and I will get such information as I can for him. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to say a couple of words about the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. The Opposition will not be supporting the amendment, but I have a lot of sympathy certainly for the first part of the amendment. The second part of the amendment causes me some difficulties. I will outline them briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the statement by Senator McMullan. I think that this Parliament does not debate enough. In fact, it is not sufficiently aware of the very significant importance of the international financial institutions, such as the IMF, the World Bank, the ADB and the EBRD. The Opposition would very much welcome debate on those matters. The reports that Senator McMullan referred to may well provide the best venue for that. My views on the two parts of the amendment are similar to those of Senator McMullan. We could go along with paragraph (a). I think there is something in that, although I take the points that Senator McMullan raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (b) is a more difficult one. As Senator McMullan said, the IMF is really quite a different institution from the World Bank and the other agencies which are essentially of a bank lending nature. Institutions such as the IMF are more hardnosed and designed to come in and help a sister country to correct its basic internal problems which lead to an external exchange rate and a currency crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I agree that to have environmental impact statements and poverty impact statements in conjunction with certain financing packages may be desirable, the basic role of the IMF is to try to get an internal economic discipline into countries that, as a result of a lack of internal discipline, have got themselves into external difficulties. To have a requirement for the IMF to produce impact statements of this nature could potentially exacerbate the problems that the IMF is there to tackle. A few wrong signals may be given by the IMF if it were required to take account of those aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are different disciplines involved through different institutions. The disciplines required by the International Monetary Fund are different from those of lending institutions such as the World Bank. Therefore, to some extent, paragraph (b) is more appropriate to a World Bank type of institution than to the IMF. I indicate that whilst the Opposition will not be supporting the Australian Democrat amendment we believe that it provides a good reason for us to have a look at some of these matters as a Parliament and a Senate before too long. I welcome the opportunity to participate in that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The $2.60 patient contribution is being introduced to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (RPBS) as a part of the overall strategy to encourage a more thoughtful and responsible use of drugs. Introduction of the charge will align the RPBS with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) where a similar co-payment was introduced for pensioners from November 1990. Data available to date indicates that introduction of the pensioner charge has resulted in a significant fall in demand without adverse health outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans are being fully compensated by means of a pharmaceutical allowance for the effect of the patient contribution and safety nets will apply. No veteran will be worse off and, depending on the amount of drugs they use, many will be better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is expected that as a result of the patient contribution there will be a fall in demand of 15 per cent compared to base line estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Net savings are estimated to be&mdash;$1.1m in 1991-92, $10.5m in 1992-93, $11.4m in 1993-94 and $12.2m in 1994-95. Gross savings were arrived at by applying the 15 per cent fall in demand to the base estimates and assuming that 10 per cent of RPBS scripts will reach the safety net in 1991-92 and 30 per cent will do so in future years. Offsetting the gross savings are additional costs to DVA and HIC, the cost of the pharmaceutical allowance and additional PBS costs (due to people reaching PBS safety nets faster because of RPBS drugs being counted towards them).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Pharmaceuticals for DTEC and SPBC holders are provided under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It would be very difficult to separate them from other community pensioners who receive drugs under the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following information for this question was provided by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated by officers from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services at Senate Estimates hearing, it is far too early to tell what the impact of pensioner co-payment will be on pharmaceutical usage patterns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in part due to the fact that there was evidence of hoarding of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme drugs by pensioners prior to the introduction of the co-payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was evidence of a reduction of dispensing for pensioners in the early part of 1991. This was about 18 per cent in February-April 1991 compared to the same period in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this is not expected to be the long-term impact. As more pensioners become eligible for the safety net and as the effects of the stockpiling fade, the size of the reduction is expected to diminish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed unfortunate that a definitive answer cannot be given. However, given the nature of the system, hoarding and safety net impact, it will be some time before a complete analysis can be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is nothing to lead the Government to believe at this stage that the long-term outcome will be any different to that originally predicted. (The total Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme budget for 1990-91 was, in fact, broadly in line with overall estimates.) So far the community has reacted as expected and the likely long-term effect was always predicted to be a reduction of around 15 per cent in the volume of prescriptions supplied to pensioners.</PARA>
