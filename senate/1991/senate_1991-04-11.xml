<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. We, the undersigned, wish to signify our strong opposition to the Chubb Report on Higher Education for the A.C.T. which proposes that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the Faculties of the Australian National University and the Faculties be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. We believe that the implementation of these proposals would mean the destruction of the Australian National University's national and international high standing and firmly established reputation as a centre of excellence in research and scholarship. The dismemberment of the ANU would severely effect the ability of both the Institute and the Faculties to attract, or even retain, high quality academic staff, funding and support. It would also adversely affect the recruitment of top students. The maintenance of the Australian National University, as it is now constituted,-a national university with an international, national and local role-is of vital importance to the A.C.T. and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>2. We call on the Senate to reject the recommendations of the Chubb report and to support the integrity of the ANU and the existing relationship between the Institute and the Faculties.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 proposes to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 to enable, among other things, collection of the superannuation supervisory levy which is proposed to be imposed by the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991. It should be read as one with that Bill. It is to come into operation on the day on which it receives Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes a number of other changes to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, to which I shall refer later.</PARA>
<PARA>Trustees of funds or trusts who lodge an annual return with the Commissioner would be liable to pay the levy when they lodge the return and it would be due and payable at the time of lodgment. It would not be a requirement for the levy, or the full amount of the levy, to be paid at the time of lodgment. However, where some levy remains unpaid, the Commissioner would have the option of either issuing or not issuing a notice concerning the satisfaction of the fund or trust conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner proposes to issue guidelines within which he would make decisions to refuse to issue a notice because of an unpaid levy. The Commissioner's decision would be a reviewable decision under the provisions of section 16 of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. This means that the decision could be reconsidered by the Commissioner and if necessary the fund or trust could apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if it were to remain dissatisfied with the outcome of the review. </PARA>
<PARA>A late payment penalty may apply if any levy moneys were to remain unpaid after lodgment. This is consistent with provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act, imposing a penalty for the late payment of tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The late payment penalty would be calculated on a monthly basis, at a rate of 20 per cent per annum of the levy which remains unpaid at the commencement of the relevant month, subject to a minimum monthly amount. </PARA>
<PARA>The late payment penalty would be calculated in the same way as the late lodgment component of the levy under the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill and the use of whole calendar months would provide a smooth cross over from one to the other, where relevant. The provisions would simplify the calculations necessary to determine the total levy to be paid. It is envisaged that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission would produce a simple ready reckoner for this purpose, to which trustees would be able to refer. In addition, the arrangements outlined would facilitate the streamlining of annual return processing in the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The levy and late payment penalty would be payable to the Commissioner and would be able to be recovered as debts due to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed new arrangements outlined above would encourage the timely payment of the correct levy amount. They would also provide flexibility by allowing the Commissioner to process returns and issue a notice of compliance in cases of small underpayments arising from simple and genuine error. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner would be able to remit the whole or a part of the late lodgment amount and the whole or a part of a late payment penalty. Guidelines would be issued by the Commissioner which would set out the criteria for the making of such decisions and, as with his decisions to refuse to issue notices of compliance because of unpaid levies, these decisions would be ultimately reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>For flexibility of administration, the Bill provides for the Commissioner to recover amounts of unpaid levy for a previous year from a current year's levy payment. This would enable the Commissioner to refuse to issue a notice of compliance to a fund relating to a current year if there were unpaid amounts arising from previous years and the total payment does not cover all amounts payable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner would be able to make regulations providing for exemptions from the levy, remissions of levy, the manner of payment for the levy and other amounts payable under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act and for the refund, or other application, of overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA>For the first few years, until accurate asset profiles of funds and trusts are available, it will be difficult to accurately estimate the revenue which would be generated each year by a prescribed levy which is graduated according to asset size. Also, the precise amount of revenue that would be required to be raised in the first year of the levy, to fully recover relevant costs of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and based on the relevant current functions of the Commission, has yet to be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated, however, that the amount required to be raised by the basic levy in the first year or two would be of the order of $6m to $8m: these amounts are therefore estimated revenue targets. </PARA>
<PARA>The revenue estimates do not include any estimate of revenue which might be generated by the late payment penalty. </PARA>
<PARA>If the current flat $40 fee were continued, it is estimated that revenue would be of the order of $3.6m. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the provisions relating to the collection of the superannuation supervisory levy, other provisions of the Bill provide that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) annual returns to the Commissioner by funds and trusts, and notices to the Commissioner required by the reasonable benefit limits provisions of Sections 15F and 15G of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act may, with the Commissioner's approval and within the Commissioner's specifications, be able to be supplied on a data processing device such as a diskette;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) a request by a person under section 15Q of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act for a copy of a previous reasonable benefit limit determination must be accompanied by a fee if such a fee is prescribed in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) where the Commissioner considers it is reasonable, he may exercise a discretion to accept a part payment of a fee as full payment where that fee relates to a return for a year prior to 1990-91 or to a return for that year which is lodged before the Bill receives Royal Assent. This is to overcome a flaw in the existing legislation which effectively requires the Commissioner to recover all underpayments, no matter how small. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes amendments to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act to correct a technical oversight that occurred when the pooled superannuation trust provisions were inserted in 1989, and proposes amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to make it clear that the late lodgment amount is not deductible from the taxable income of a fund or trust. </PARA>
<PARA>All the amendments to be achieved by this Bill would come into effect on the Bill receiving Royal Assent, and, to the extent that they affect returns to be lodged by funds and trusts, would apply to returns lodged after the Bill receives Royal Assent which are for the year of income commencing on 1 July 1990 or a subsequent year of income. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill to the Senate, and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators may remember that at the adjournment last night I was talking about the then most recent proposal before the public from the Australian Democrats and was noting without surprise that their proposal conveniently divided the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) into constituencies of just such a size that with their normal vote the Australian Democrats might reasonably be able to expect to win a seat in each of those constituencies. That is a surprise to the Senate, I am sure. The Democrats will continue to assume that everybody else makes decisions on self-interest whereas they make their decisions on principle, which always conveniently suits them. But that is not a matter on which I wish to dwell any further. I made that point yesterday, and I enjoyed the chance to make it twice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I welcome the report appearing in this morning's Canberra Times newspaper, the details of which are not yet fully disclosed, but which indicates that the ACT Liberal Party, the Australian Democrats, the Residents Rally and the Proportional Representation Society-a quadrella that nobody would want back-have come to an agreement about what form of Hare-Clark they will support, and the details of that are going to be disclosed later today. </PARA>
<PARA> From a partisan Labor Party point of view it is a pity that that agreement has been reached because we would have continued to have a bit of fun until the day they had come to such an agreement. But I think the debate will be enhanced because they have come to such an agreement so early. I look forward to the release of the details, and whether they have Robson rotations, Buchanan versions or other such spectacular innovations will be a matter we will await with interest but not much enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some important questions flowing from this agreement which I want to make clear to Senator Reid and Senator Bell before they speak. I have consulted with the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) this morning following that agreement, which of course we expected would come at some time but which has been indicated is going to happen today. I want to make the following three points to Senators Reid and Bell which I think they will welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Democrats in this chamber and in the House of Representatives will be consulted about the wording of the Hare-Clark question on the referendum. Secondly, if there is to be a publicly funded document of the normal yes-no type-and there has not been any decision of whether that should be done-in accordance with normal practice the Liberal Party and the Australian Democrats will be expected, and we will be happy for them, to write the Hare-Clark case. We will, of course, write the House of Representatives case and, in the interests of consistency, which is standard, we will be seeking some sort of common format within which those two will be written. Thirdly, we would wish that common format include a sample of what the ballot-paper would look like under each of the two systems being proposed. Those are proposals which I think would be welcomed by the Liberal Party and Australian Democrats. I have consulted the Minister and he is happy for me to convey that information to the chamber this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there is a lot more that can be said and will be said during the course of the important debate about the electoral system in the ACT, I will confine myself to saying that I look forward to both the election in February and the campaign for the referendum. The referendum is a matter in which I expect to be somewhat more involved than the election itself. It is nice to have an election in which one is not a candidate; it is much better for the nerves. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to the referendum campaign. I will be supporting the introduction into the ACT Legislative Assembly of the system for the House of Representatives, because I think it meets the multiple objectives of electoral systems better than any alternative that has been considered and better than any version of the Hare-Clark which may come forward. Whatever the outcome, the development of an electoral system which is chosen by the people of the ACT, which has their confidence and which has the standard democratic legitimacy that the system around Australia enjoys, is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> Whichever State one goes to in Australia where there is no gerrymander, the electoral system essentially has the support of the people and they accept that the outcome delivered under it are fair. Although they do not always like it if their side does not win, they accept that the system is fair and appropriate. It is desirable that that should be the case in the ACT. The outcome of the processes set in train by this Bill, when it is finally amended, will be a step forward in the development of democracy in the ACT. Therefore, I look forward to the debate around it but I welcome and support the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The central theme of my remarks today concerns the wastefulness of actually conducting this debate at this time. That does not mean that it should not be conducted at all-we have been anxious to see it come on for some months, even years-but there are reasons why it is a waste to have this debate now. Senator McMullan told us yesterday that he favoured single member electorates and in a previous debate on this matter the Government made it quite clear that it also favoured single member electorates. But on the strength of that, what we see in front of us today is the Government introducing a Bill which plainly it does not support, knowing that the Opposition will be presenting substantial amendments to that Bill and knowing that the Australian Democrats do not support the direction of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill is intended to bring about an electoral system which will become redundant as soon as it is used. At the same time, this Bill intends to bring about a referendum which will be conducted concurrently with that soon to be redundant electoral system. The referendum will choose the next electoral system, but after that the responsibility for choosing an electoral system for future elections will be devolved to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) legislature. But in the middle of all this, the Government proposes to hive off this Bill to a committee; so yet another variable and possibility for devising yet another electoral system is introduced to the whole mess to make a greater mess. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator McMullan rightly described a camel committee procedure. We know what is involved there, but in this case we have a bubbling, broiling mess into which this Government proposes to drop yet another camel. I really cannot understand the purpose of that. The only purpose I can see is to move the responsibility away from the Government to other groups so that the Government can suggest that other groups have had a part in devising the electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent to me that this whole mess has been caused by this Government's inability to actually recognise what the ACT needs in terms of an electoral system, what the electorate of the ACT wants, and what the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia is likely to accept. It is the Government's incapacity to deal with this whole system which causes us to be engaged in this waste of time today. We can describe it as a waste of time because all of this could be avoided by conducting a referendum as soon as possible to determine what the electors of the ACT would prefer. </PARA>
<PARA> The preference of the ACT electorate could be determined by the referendum. Of course, that preference should involve the opportunity to choose between existing and understood systems. That is essentially what the proposed referendum, to be conducted concurrently with the next ACT election, has identified. The systems have been identified as the best proportional representation system in Australia, the Hare-Clark system, or single member electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I must comment that other systems were available within Australia that could have been instituted before we had this abomination of the d'Hondt arrangement. The Senate system, which is another system of proportional representation, is a system which is understood by Australians. It is a ready-made system which has been road-tested, if you like, in Australia, as has the Hare-Clark proportional representational system. Again in passing, the problems that have been created here result from the attempts to modify a system which is foreign to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> From what should have been a simple, straightforward matter of whether to allow the ACT to choose its own form of election system this has become an entwined, convoluted conglomeration of grubby party political machinations. These things are unintelligible and even unexplainable to the majority of the ACT citizens, but that majority of ACT citizens is quite clear about one thing-it is quite clear about its abhorrence of d'Hondt. Anything that smells-even a whiff-of d'Hondt has become an anathema to those who vote in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> This move here today contrives to impose d'Hondt on the ACT for at least this forthcoming election. We can be told that it is modified modified demodified d'Hondt, but it is still d'Hondt and that is what offends the people of the ACT. That is what they fail to understand. After that election it is to become redundant. We were told yesterday by Senator McMullan that it would be a considerable drafting expense-time, effort and energy-to modify d'Hondt to become modified modified demodified d'Hondt, and yet it is to be redundant immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not admit that we would have to send the whole business off to a committee. If we had a referendum now to choose between the tried and true Hare-Clark system, and a single member electorate system which the electorate of Australia understands, why would we have to go to a committee to devise modification of that? I would imagine that that process would be considerably cheaper than the convoluted contrivances which we are faced with today. This move contrives to impose d'Hondt on the ACT for at least another election. That is something which I see as being an unjustifiable expense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The excuse given by the coalition for not supporting a referendum as soon as possible had to do with the cost of a referendum. There has been no recognition of the extra costs associated with the administration of another clumsy d'Hondt arrangement. The administration itself requires education. That is another point which Senator McMullan included in his justification-that there needs to be time for education and explanation. If we are to explain the modified modified demodified, second time around d'Hondt, it will need more time and greater expense than would be required to explain a system which is already tried and proven in Australia-the system which the electors of the ACT have already had some exposure to with regard to the Senate elections. I presume Senator McMullan realises that he got here as a result of a proportional representation system of election-the Senate election itself. Such a system should not require a great deal of explanation to those electors who elected him. </PARA>
<PARA> The other cost which has not been mentioned by those who have claimed that the cost of a referendum would be greater than is justifiable is the cost to good government of the operation of an electoral system which is demonstrably incapable of delivering to the electorate what it wants. Against the immense costs of poor government and clumsy electoral systems, opponents of the referendum now in the ACT claim that the potential cost of something less than $1m or approximately $1m is just too much. </PARA>
<PARA> If $1m is too much to spend on bringing about a more workable electoral system for the ACT, then we can assume that that is the extent to which representative democracy has been devalued by such commentators. If we really believe in representative democracy, we should be taking every opportunity to improve the system by which we elect our representatives. If we are parsimonious to the extent that we will not spend $1m to bring about an improvement, then our belief in representative democracy should be questioned.</PARA>
<PARA> The drafting of this complicated legislation for this one election could not even be justified on the grounds of being of any interest to electoral commentators or political science students or even the advancement of electoral studies within Australia. After this concoction is made redundant, I doubt that there will even be passing interest in such a thing. I doubt that anybody would want to examine the process for any reason other than idle curiosity. I cannot see any reason why any other group of citizens throughout the world would ever want to copy it or take an example from it. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Government were really interested in saving every possible dollar in the pursuit of a resolution of this problem, we would have seen greater efforts being made to negotiate amendments to this Bill before bringing it to this chamber and then sending it off to a committee. Mention was made earlier of previous negotiations with the Democrats on this matter. That is as well as may be. That was conducted in a different situation with different principles in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point, the negotiations have bogged down with a similar sort of description as Senator McMullan gave about the Democrats' position previously. The position, as I understand it, from those representing the Government on this matter has simply been that single member electorates is its preferred position, that it would like to reach a situation where it could at least run that argument through, and that a referendum would allow it that possibility, but a referendum could not be conducted too soon because it might expose the argument over self-government or non self-government again. If that happened too soon, it might detract from the process of the election. That situation was described on behalf of the Government by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Simmons, in the other place. He said in his speech on the matter that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . any referendum result is unlikely to identify clear electoral support for any single system. </PARA>
<PARA>Further he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . and may merely serve to regenerate earlier debates on the merits of self-government.</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the cost matter, that was given as a justification for not conducting a referendum. It seems to me that the debate on self-government or non self-government has been accepted with greater maturity by the electorate of the ACT. The myriad press comments on this matter and the continual re-emergence of this discussion on talkback radio news items, et cetera, have not generated that discussion. Yet each of those media opportunities could have been taken by any one of those commentators to regenerate that argument. I do not think that that argument has been taken with the immaturity to which the Minister referred in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate of the ACT has gone past that. The electors of the ACT are concerned about the system which will be foisted upon them. They are concerned, informed and wish to see that problem resolved. All we are doing here is putting several steps in the way of that process of resolution. We could have simplified it better still within our capacity by introducing a referendum as soon as possible. I have outlined what I consider to be some of the not inconsiderable costs which will be associated with going through the hoops that we have here. Those costs come very close to outweighing the cost which it is claimed the referendum would bring. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' position on this has been consistent over some years and essentially coincides with the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in that a referendum should be held in the ACT to choose between a system of proportional representation and single member electorates. We believe that that should be held as soon as possible and, if possible, before the next election is due. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the d'Hondt system has been and will continue to be rejected by the ACT electorate. As was mentioned in passing by Senator Macdonald, we are also pleased to note that several political organisations within the ACT have developed this matter a little further to the extent that representatives of the Liberal Party of Australia, the Proportional Representation Society of Australia, the Residents Rally and the Australian Democrats met and agreed on the type of Hare-Clark system that they will endorse in the forthcoming referendum. The group has written to me and informed me of its unity on this matter. The fears that Senator McMullan has are quite well founded. The group is particularly unified. Its degree of sophistication and understanding of the possibilities has allowed it to put aside the technical difficulties and arguments which one might expect of such a widely representative group. Its unity is on simplifying Hare-Clark in its description to the electorate of the ACT and to stick with the aspects of Hare-Clark which have been refined in the Tasmanian electorate to such an extent that it is easily understood and truly representative. This group has paid particular attention to what has worked well in Tasmania. I will mention a couple of points about that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the point. I will accept that interjection and address that because quite often we hear the Robson rotation mentioned in a derisory way with the implication that it is somehow a crazy system which complicates matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will admit it sounds an attractive phrase to use if we are trying to confuse people. The Robson rotation system sounds as if we are going to turn everything on its head. It fact, it simply means that the names of the candidates are rotated on the ballot-paper. The effect is that the party machinery-the party apparatchiks, the faceless people-do not determine who gets into parliament; the electors do. That is an immensely powerful tool. It is a wonderful adaptation of the electoral system so that the power is returned to the people. Rather than ridiculing and trying to nullify the sophistication of such a system, the Government would be well advised to put that criticism away and to endorse the Robson rotation system as a very good thing for the electorate to be able to use. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of that system in Tasmania, the power of the faceless decision makers of party machinery has been reduced greatly. The people who vote have taken the trouble and the time to learn about the candidates so that they can choose whom they select as No. 1. The donkey vote which can be derided, and is worthy of derision, no longer applies in Tasmania. It does apply where the Robson rotation system is not used. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan spent some time extolling the virtues of single member electorates and suggested that, because the rest of mainland Australia understands SMEs, that was the only way to go. Of course, Tasmania has single member electorates for the House of Representatives seats but wisely, in the election under its own jurisdiction, Tasmania uses the Hare-Clark, complete with Robson rotation. Like the rest of Australia, Tasmania uses a style of proportional representation (PR) for the Senate. Senator McMullan should recognise that all of Australia is familiar with the Senate PR system and that should not require a great deal of education and explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The SMEs can easily be demonstrated as being entirely undemocratic in the way in which they operate. It is an easy demonstration to point out that this system of which Senator McMullan is so enamoured effectively disfranchises more than 1.1 million Australians in the House of Representatives election. They are the people who vote No. 1 for the Australian Democrats in the lower House election. Those 1.1 million people-the number is actually in excess of that-remain unrepresented by our Party in the lower House. In that place more than 700,000 people voted for the National Party of Australia and they are represented by a considerable number of National Party representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great inequity in that and it has been brought about entirely by the existence of single member electorates. It is not to do with the total number of people who voted for one particular political philosophy; it is to do with the electoral system that has delivered that inequity to the lower House. However, in the Senate the more than one million Democrat voters are represented by about the right proportion of senators who hold seats on their behalf. That is proportional representation. That is true and fair democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> On reading briefly the debate which took place in the other place on this matter, I was not enlightened greatly by the contributions of those honourable members who took part in that debate. I think the debate fell short of recognising that what this Bill was doing was complicating essentially what could be a simple issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We were reminded by Mr Simmons in his contribution that this Parliament has a constitutional responsibility to ensure the good and stable government of this nation's capital. In response to that statement, I ask why the electors of this nation's capital are being subjected to at least two, probably three and perhaps even four different electoral systems in as many elections. If that is good and stable government, I think the Federal Government should be looking closely at its definitions of good and stable government and listening more to the definitions which the electorate of the ACT would provide to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The contributions that I read on this subject also included those from the Opposition. Some mention was made of the amount of time that was being devoted to or allowed for the debate. There was criticism of the fact that the Government sat on the matter for some 18 months and then seemed to rush it through into the lower House without much preamble. It was said that that demonstrated the kind of contempt the Labor Party had for that chamber when it came to seriously debating some of the proposals put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with that. I think it reflects the inability of the Government to negotiate seriously a position which would be shared by all parties on this matter. There was a great deal of uncertainty on behalf of the Government for some 18 months before this position was brought about, and perhaps it reflects an exasperation, a frustration, at being unable to come up with an agreed position. But, rhetoric aside, I think that that exasperation was caused just as much by the Government's commitment to, and belief in, single member electorates rather than the intransigence of either the coalition or the Democrats. I have a problem with some of the contributions from speakers on the Government side in the lower House debate. A Government member said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill may not be ideal, but it is the system that the Government had thought that the Opposition was going to agree to and that, therefore, had a reasonable chance of being passed by the Senate. The Opposition has now gone back on that agreement, but the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill, although it keeps in place a form of the d'Hondt system, involves a considerable improvement, a simplification of the d'Hondt system, and therefore is a Bill that I support. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the honourable member thought the Opposition might support the Bill so it was worth trying: it was not really the best thing that could happen but it was worth putting up. That is the sort of attitude that leads to us not knowing where we are going. It leads to great uncertainties and to the need to send the Bill off to a committee. There is the potential for huge waste with that sort of confused uncertainty on the Government side. If that is the best that the Government can offer, that sort of meandering and wishy-washy stuff, no wonder we are faced with such a waste and no wonder the ACT electorate is disappointed and disgusted with the efforts that this Government is making on its behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by repeating what I said before. There is no demonstrable need to go through this concoction, this contrivance. It could have been resolved quite simply by having a referendum as soon as possible. It is still possible to have that referendum, and I contend that the expense of that referendum would be almost matched by the inordinate expense of drafting an electoral system which will become redundant the day after it is first used. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill 1991 seeks to amend a Bill that was passed by this Parliament which became known as the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. This came about at the same time as the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, which conferred upon the Australian Capital Territory the opportunity and responsibility of governing itself in many areas, but the electoral system was one which was determined, as was totally appropriate, by this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the issues which is relevant to the debate that is taking place now is: at what point is it appropriate for this Parliament to pass to the people of the ACT the responsibility for their own electoral system? It seems strange indeed that at this stage, as Senator Bell has mentioned, we are fiddling with the system for the next election and saying that the responsibility will pass to the ACT after the next election. It has not been clearly explained, to my satisfaction, why the responsibility would not have been passed to the ACT between 1988 and 15 February 1992, when the election will be held; it could have had the responsibility then. We can only conjecture why the Australian Labor Party took the view that it wanted to have another go under this system, or a slightly modified system, and then hand the responsibility over to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to look through some of the things that have occurred on the way through. The first ACT election was held on 4 March 1989. It is well-known that it took about nine weeks to count the votes and that the declaration of the polls occurred on 8 May 1989. It was very clear during that election campaign that many Canberra residents did not want self-government. The outcome of the vote was as the people of the ACT wanted it to be. They voted for parties known as No Self-Government and Abolish Self-Government. Of course, as a consequence, representatives of those parties were elected. Of the 17 candidates elected, there were four from the Liberal Party, five from the Labor Party, four from the Residents Rally, three from the No-Self Government Party and one from the Abolish Self-Government Party. There were 117 candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> People tend to think that it was because of the number of candidates that it took so long to count the votes. There can be no doubt that that was the case. But when we think of the number of countries where people will kill each other for the right to have a say, we ought not to decry the fact that there were a number of people who wanted to be a part of it. I felt it was quite understandable that for the first election there would indeed be a large number of candidates. There were 108 candidates representing parties and nine independents. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those who put their names forward as parties were, I think, attempting to ridicule the system. That is my interpretation of it in any event. There was the Party! Party! Party!, the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party and the Surprise Party. I think that was a pity because it seemed to me that it was a consequence of the huge ballot-paper-it was about a metre wide, with 139 boxes-and those aspects tended to dominate the coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some confusion about the system of voting, although I am not quite certain why that was the case because it seemed to be fairly widely discovered. One of the results was that the National Party of Australia and the Australian Democrats distributed how-to-vote cards which were, in fact, at odds with the electoral legislation. So it has to be accepted that there was some confusion about the voting system. There was a higher proportion of informal votes than is normally the case in a Senate election, which normally has about a 2.95 per cent level of informality. The proportion of informal votes in the ACT election was 5.69 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There were complicated rules for formality and for deeming preferences. For example, votes were deemed formal if preferences after the first number followed any ascending unrepeated series of numbers. That is meant to be simpler, Madam Acting Deputy President. I think most voters would have understood it better if they had followed the normal system of numbering consecutively for the vote to be formal. Eighty to 90 per cent of voters in the ACT used the ticking of the box system and in the ACT 60 per cent of ballot-papers followed what was termed `no consistent' pattern. That is not surprising when one considers that there were 117 candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> The scrutiny under the modified d'Hondt system, as it was called, required eight stages and ballot papers had to be sorted into an astonishing 209 categories, whereas for a Senate vote only 140 categories would have been required for the same number of ballot papers-still a large number of movements of ballot papers in any event. There was an inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory election by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and it is worth looking at some of the things that the Committee concluded. It said that, because of the way the Australian Capital Territory electoral system had evolved, the outcome was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an unacceptable system which has brought the never popular self-government concept into further disrepute in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to note that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the current system was considered unacceptable in its present form by all witnesses who expressed an opinion-</PARA>
<PARA>although, as the Chairman commented:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the first twelve witnesses proposed twelve different electoral systems to replace modified D'Hondt. </PARA>
<PARA>It sounds like a meeting of accountants and economists. The Committee went through the matter fairly thoroughly. It claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . because of the difficulties associated with the first Australian Capital Territory election, namely the size of the ballot paper, the length of the count and the near impossibility of understanding how to cast an effective vote, the Committee was unable to come up with changes to the modified D'Hondt system which would be considered acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear from studying the report and other data about electoral systems that there is no such thing as a perfect electoral system. The Committee considered the merits of various different proposals, but was influenced, it seems, by the expressed concern of the Australian Electoral Commission about the undesirability of `an excessive proliferation' of electoral systems in Australia. The report concluded that the choice should be between the familiar alternatives of single member electorates or a Hare-Clark system of proportional representation with multi-member electorates. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is however unable to recommend either system as one that would at present be likely to secure passage through both Houses of Parliament. For that reason it recommends that the choice be put to the Australian Capital Territory electorate in a referendum.</PARA>
<PARA>It has taken the Government a long time to come to the view that a referendum is the appropriate way of dealing with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) earlier in this debate said that the D'Hondt system was not a bad electoral system. I agree with him, but I also recognise that the system has been so criticised in the Australian Capital Territory that it is almost impossible for the good within that system as a proportional representation system to be sold. I would prefer it to the Hare-Clark system, but it would take a brave person to embark on the course of persuading the people of the Australian Capital Territory that that was the case. It looks as though we are moving in another direction.</PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise that, while the Government says that it is coming here with an amendment to the 1988 Bill with a view to simplifying things, it is taking away from Australian Capital Territory voters some of the value of the vote that they had in 1988. If the Government's view were to prevail, their vote in 1992 would be less valuable than it was. The Government is now saying that voters can only vote horizontally within the list they start with; whereas in 1989 when we voted one could put one's number one vote where one pleased and then proceed with the rest of the value of the vote across the ballot paper among the candidates who were standing in the order that one chose. The reality of what we are looking at today is a reduction in the value of the vote that we had previously. It is not a refinement to make the vote more valuable or anything of that kind; it restricts a voter who votes Labor to sticking with Labor, and clearly that is what the Government prefers. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan in his speech criticised widely those who wanted systems other than that which he preferred. He seemed to be attacking everybody in general who did not agree with him, and the Australian Democrats in particular, I thought, suggesting that everybody else only wanted the electoral system that best suited him or her. I invite Senator McMullan to contemplate that he is doing precisely the same thing in that he wants his voters to stick strictly to the system that he is presenting, that is, to vote one for Labor and stick with it. He, too, if anyone else is, is presenting an electoral system which best suits the Australian Labor Party. The one Labor most prefers, as we know, is the single member electorate. Obviously now the Labor Party, after a very long time of not wanting a referendum, has decided that a referendum may well deliver it single member electorates so that it can find the money and the time to have a go at it. Talking of the timing, I point out that to hold the referendum at the same time as the election is totally inappropriate. If there was going to be a referendum it should have been held long before this so that 15 February could be devoted to electing members on the relevant issues of governing the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now put to the Senate that that is very difficult and that it could not be done before then because it would be very costly. It would cost more, but honourable senators in this place have been aware for months and years of the extravagances of this Government. The Government can find money for any cause it really wants to find it for. The number of examples could take up the rest of the morning. Kodak is one name to mention as sufficient to indicate how this Government will find money for the causes it wants to pursue when it wants to do so, but not in this instance because it does not suit the Government. That is all right, as long as those opposite do not come in here moralising about what they are trying to do and how everybody else is behaving. Let us be quite honest about what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this amendment Bill of 1991. It provides for a revised system to elect the Legislative Assembly. It is the pure d'Hondt system, or as near to that as I can interpret pure d'Hondt to be, whereas in 1988 the system that was put in place gave more value to a vote than would be the case under the proposed system. We do not want the same sort of delays that occurred in the 1989 election, and I do not believe that they would be the same. In any event, the consequence of delay is not the same in that there is a government and a Chief Minister in place. When the election is held on 15 February, 1992 the new government will take its place at some time after that when the poll is declared, but in the meantime there is a government that will stay in place and stay in charge. That was not the case in 1989, when no government could be formed until such time as the poll had been declared. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports a system of preferential proportional representation to enable the electors of the Australian Capital Territory to have as wide as possible an opportunity to express their preferences within the party of their choice or across party lines. It has been said that single member electorates is the form of election most commonly used in this country, and that is the case. But, apart from Queensland, in the other instances there are two chambers to the parliaments, which I think makes a considerable difference. It is the case in this Parliament that there are single member electorates in regard to one place, proportional representation in another. We are talking about an electoral system for a parliament which has only one chamber. If, as has been widely said to be the case, Labor would get 16 out of 17 seats with single member electorates in Canberra, that can hardly be said to be a system which gives a fair representation of the views of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> We know pretty well how they vote. Luckily, one-third plus a bit usually vote for the Liberal Party of Australia in Senate elections; 40 per cent or so vote for the Australian Labor Party and, of course, there are others whose first preference candidate is not elected to the Senate. However, it indicates that the ACT community is not one that clearly divides itself into two camps when it comes to voting. Therefore, with that knowledge, proportional representation for a single chamber is the fairest way of ensuring that the electorate will have an opportunity to express its view. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other amendments which are being put forward to raise the deposit $100 to $250, which is the same as that for the Senate. That seems a sensible and reasonable amendment to the 1988 Bill and all political parties, other than the parliamentary parties, will be required to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100 eligible ACT electors. That arises from the names of some of the parties which I read out earlier, which were registered as parties in 1988. It may be said that that is taking a heavy handed approach to minority groups. I cannot accept that because a group which is able to form a party with 100 members will be able to run candidates and express its view. However, I do not think that I have to take seriously as a contender for governing the people of the ACT a party that seeks to register itself as `Party! Party! Party!'. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, individuals will be prevented from being the registered officer of more than one party. My comprehension of belonging to a political party is such that I cannot see that restriction as being regarded as a hardship. I cannot imagine how one could possibly be committed to two separate philosophies and be the registered officer of two separate parties in any event. So I am happy to support that. However, the coalition does not support the proposal to restrict preferences to a party list, and I have dealt with that sufficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill was debated in another place it was said that the Government was sending the message to voters that to vote for an independent candidate or minority party would be a wasted vote. I have also said sufficient on the issue of the value of the vote to indicate that I do not regard that attitude to a vote as being an appropriate one. It is cynical when one thinks that at the last election 60 per cent of the voters opted to depart from the party line and voted as they saw fit across the ballot-paper. Although with the size of the ballot-paper those who embarked upon it faced quite a task. </PARA>
<PARA> The voters in the ACT are an educated and informed group. They have shown repeatedly how they wish to vote selectively amongst all candidates who put themselves forward. Our proposals are aimed at ensuring that voters have the freedom to direct their preferences as they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer also to the matter that Senator Bell raised, of sending this Bill to a committee. I do not understand his criticism of that action. I certainly do not interpret the Bill going to a committee in the way that he does. At the end of the second reading debate, the Bill will go to the appropriate committee, pursuant to the selection of Bills procedures that we are presently operating under. The amendments will be dealt with there in what is, I hope, becoming the normal way. I personally feel that the selection of Bills process that we are trialling at present is working extremely well and is assisting enormously with dealing with legislation and the opportunities that people have to look at the details of Bills. I see it as a necessary step with this Bill. We have to be sure that we get it right. We have to be sure that the amendments being made to the 1988 Bill are absolutely correct and as they should be. So I have to totally dissociate myself from the approach that Senator Bell took to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with him either when he said that the question of the electoral system should not be a matter for this chamber to decide. The electoral system is still the responsibility of the Federal Parliament and until we hand that over to the ACT Government, that remains the case. It is not a matter that can be determined by any outside groups or by anyone else but us. It may be very fair criticism to say that is should have been handed over to the people of the ACT before now, but that is not the case and we have the responsibility for the system for the election on 15 February 1992. When referring to that, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) in his speech in the other place indicated that it would be handed over after that election. It has not been satisfactorily explained why it could not be handed over before. The ACT Liberal Party and the Legislative Assembly itself support the repatriation of the legislative system to allow the Assembly to design its own electoral system. We think that should have been done before 1992. I can only conclude that it is a cynical approach of the Labor Party to try to use the modification to this electoral system to its advantage in the hope that it will be in charge of putting in a new electoral system after 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> However, since this debate was held in another place and the Bill was passed, the Government has announced that a referendum will be held. I welcome the statement by Senator McMullan this morning that the other parties and interested groups will be consulted about the form of the referendum and that if a document is presented to the electorate it will follow the normal practice of including a sample of the ballot-paper et cetera. That announcement was a welcome beginning to the debate after the somewhat flippant way that Senator McMullan dealt with the questions that were raised last night on the referendum. He asked: what sort of a Hare-Clark system; what is the Hare-Clark system? He quoted various views of what it should be, whether it would be the Buchanan model et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> So at least the adjournment of the debate from last night until this morning was valuable in one respect, but some of these questions remain and need to be answered. If they are not answered properly in a way that the electorate understands, the Government may well be accused of setting up a referendum where the answer to it is almost determined by the way it is presented. </PARA>
<PARA> How will the questions be framed? It is clear that only Hare-Clark will be included and not d'Hondt as well, even though it was suggested today that that was not a bad system. It perhaps has to be left out, but not even that has been explained adequately. How much will be spent on advertising the case to the electorate? Will it include the Robson rotation system? That matter has been mentioned today and it was mentioned by Senator Bell. A couple of weeks ago I heard Senator Aulich talk about the Robson rotation and the Hare-Clark system on local radio. He claimed to have been the person who introduced the Robson rotation system in Tasmania and he certainly advocated it most strongly. However, he conceded that it introduces some instability in that Ministers are always at risk within the electorate because they are so busy looking after their portfolio responsibilities that they do not have the same time for electorate work as other members do, which means that they are more vulnerable during an election under the Robson rotation system. That is obviously something that Senator Aulich rejects as a serious disadvantage, but it is an aspect of the system that needs to be considered carefully because one thing we do need is stability in government. If that is a serious matter of instability one has to consider carefully whether it should be advocated. </PARA>
<PARA> When will we see the documentation about the referendum? When will be know what is happening? When will we know how many electorates will be the basis of the Hare-Clark proposal, and how many will be in each of the electorates? Yesterday Senator McMullan said that time was moving on and that we are getting very near to the election, and that is absolutely right. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not long from now until 15 February and, as he said, the election is rapidly approaching and the referendum too is rapidly approaching. In that case, I say to the Government that it has a very clear responsibility to see that the matter that will be put to the people by way of referendum is known very soon and that it will be clear to the people what is being asked of them.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government may well consider a ballot-paper which rotated the questions so that not everybody in the electorate received an identical ballot-paper, and so eliminate any preference. But which of the two would be put on top? Is it drawn out of a hat? How is a decision made on which of the two questions is on the top of the ballot-paper? Maybe they should be rotated so that when a voter gets the ballot-paper randomly he or she cannot be certain which way the questions will appear on it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of things outstanding and it is a pity that so much time has been lost already. We do not agree with the approach the Government is taking to the amendment to the original Bill in this amendment Bill. As has been clearly stated, our position is clear. We believe the people of the ACT should be able to use their vote to the maximum extent of its validity and express their preferences across the ballot-paper so that that is the outcome for each vote which is cast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill because I do have some personal knowledge and interest in the Hare-Clark electoral system, which appears to be the system favoured by both the Australian Democrats and the Liberal Party of Australia on this occasion. But before I make some comments about the Hare-Clark voting system and the issues that I believe should be examined by those who are proposing it on this occasion, I have to say that, as I am speaking in this debate for the Government, I reject the accusation that we are acting out of self-interest in supporting the single member electoral system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Government does not act out of self-interest. We act in the best interests of the country and the nation. There is clear evidence that our decisions have been based on fact and have been taken in the best interests of the running of the country. It is very clear that at both the State and Federal level the vast majority of elections are conducted under a single member electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania, it may well be that we got it around the wrong way in the sense that we have a proportional representation system known as the Hare-Clark system for elections to our lower House, but we do have single member electorates for our upper House. I suppose that, if we were proposing single member electorates on the basis of self-interest, we would need to be a little cautious. In Tasmania, with the single member electorates in our upper House, and because Tasmania, like the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), is so small and has a very small voting population, rather interestingly there has not been dominance by large political parties. In fact, it has produced a dominance by Independents. In the Tasmanian upper House, out of 19 members, there are only two members of political parties-one Liberal and one Labor. The rest are Independents. So it certainly cannot be said that we are supporting single member electorates on this occasion out of self-interest, and I reject that charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Hare-Clark voting system-I have been involved in many State elections in Tasmania both as a campaign manager of some of our candidates, as a scrutineer on behalf of the party and also on my only one try-a failed attempt-to be elected to our State parliament. So I have some personal knowledge of the way in which the Hare-Clark voting system operates and can highlight some aspects that those opposite should very carefully examine before they embrace the system, as they appear to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The comment has been made that the Hare-Clark system is a very fair system and that it is as near close to perfect as one can get in terms of the outcome. That is necessarily so. If the Liberal Party in Tasmania were asked today what it thinks of the result of the last State election as a consequence of the Hare-Clark system, I think it would be very critical of the outcome. I well remember, when the Labor Government, I think in 1972, lost office to a combined Liberal Party-Independent coalition, the Labor Party had won a majority of the votes and yet ended up not being in government. So, it is not correct to say that the Hare-Clark system is perfect in that it reflects the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> In any Hare-Clark system with a number of seats-two, three, four or whatever is adopted if it should be the preferred option of people in the ACT-it is very easy to obtain the majority of members in a particular electorate but it becomes very difficult to go beyond that. If the vote is concentrated it is quite possible, as has occurred in Tasmania, for the party receiving the majority of the vote not to end up being the Government. So, it is not necessarily correct to say that the Hare-Clark system will mean that the party with 50 per cent of the vote plus one will be in government. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot has been said in this debate about the so-called Robson amendment. The Robson amendment was introduced by Robson, who was a Liberal member of our State parliament. In Tasmania until that time, the names of the candidates in our elections appeared in alphabetical order. It is certainly true that this did result in some fairly quaint outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I can recall on one occasion when our former Premier, Doug Lowe, received a massive vote which was, I think, the highest personal vote on record of any candidate in a State election. As the then Premier he received well over 50 per cent of the vote and four quotas. But, underneath him because of the way in which the names were allocated on the list, there was a candidate who received between 200 and 300 votes and many other candidates received far more than 200 or 300 votes. But because the name of this candidate was under the name of the Premier, who had received some four quotas, he was elected on the basis of the donkey vote. A significant proportion of electors, regrettably, voted for our Premier and then continued on down the list which resulted in a candidate with only a few hundred votes being elected. This very clearly was not the result of persons making a selective choice but was the result of the so-called donkey vote. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that, Robson, who was a member of the Liberal Party, introduced-as a private member's Bill which was subsequently adopted by the Government-the concept of the rotating ballot. It is not a perfect rotation and I think those opposite should be aware of that. The names are rotated but they are still kept in an order. They are not randomly selected so that every ballot-paper is totally different. So that point needs to be made about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, in the subsequent election, it does cause some confusion when one goes to vote. As we know, it is quite traditional for families to go in, collect their ballot-papers together and talk about how they are going to vote. It does cause some confusion when people end up with different ballot-papers which have names in different orders. I am sure that that had something to do with the fact that the informal vote increased at the subsequent election using the rotational ballot-paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect that those opposite might like to consider, if they are in favour of Hare-Clark system, is whether or not how-to-vote cards will be allowed to be handed out. In Tasmania it is not permissible to hand out how-to-vote cards or to engage in any form of political propaganda within 200 metres of a polling booth, which does make it somewhat difficult to hand out how-to-vote cards. That is another aspect of the electoral system in Tasmania which those opposite might like to consider. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect which has not been mentioned, and which is very important, is the issue of a countback. It is certainly true that the Hare-Clark system does result in a very close reflection, in terms of parliamentary representation, of party support. All elections in Tasmania are inevitably close in terms of the number of seats. It did not occur in the last State election, but in the previous two State elections the Liberal Party very clearly had the majority of votes-I think between 53 and 55 per cent of the primary vote. It was very clear that it was the party of first preference of the majority of Tasmanians, but it did not have the major parliamentary majority. It did not enjoy-as one does under a single member electoral system-a majority of landslide proportions. That is an inevitable outcome of the Hare-Clark system and many people would argue that it is a desirable outcome because it reflects the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it does have one drawback in that if there are-as there will be under the Hare-Clark system-very close results in an election, it will have to be decided whether in fact by-elections will be allowed under the system or whether there will be countbacks, as we have in Tasmania. If there is a close result under the Hare-Clark system and there is clear evidence that that will be the case, inevitably every time there is a by-election, if that is the system that is adopted, it is likely that the whole future of the Government will be determined at that by-election. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people might argue that that is a good thing; but, on average, at least once a year-as occurs in the Tasmanian system-we have a countback because a member retires. Some people would argue that it is desirable that we have by-elections in order to obtain the latest views of people's thinking. However, the fact is that the by-election will inevitably turn into a general election. So there can be a certain amount of instability if the by-election method is used to fill vacancies. I certainly urge those opposite to think very closely about that system. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the countback method, a lot has been made of the freedom to select candidates right across the party groupings and that this is what voters do in Tasmania. I certainly refute that. In Tasmania, where we normally run seven or eight candidates, it is the better known candidates-who tend to be existing members of parliament-who do very well. Two or three candidates tend to make up the list, because it is simply not possible for any party to elect six or seven of its candidates. These two or three candidates-if you like, the second grade candidates from an electoral point of view-who usually do not obtain more than a few votes, because of the countback system, can quite often be elected to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that the Labor Party was faced with some minor embarrassment because we had a number of resignations and we were facing the prospect of running out of Labor candidates under the countback system. We got down to our last candidate who had received only 200-odd votes. Unfortunately, he had been expelled from the Labor Party, and we had to re-admit him pretty quickly. I have to say that that was the cause of some embarrassment on that occasion. But I question whether, when we get down to the last three or four candidates, we are really reflecting the will of the people in that sense; given that, on many occasions, they receive only a handful of votes. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is highly improbable that the majority of Tasmanian electors obtain all of the information on all of the candidates for whom they have to vote and that they actually sit down and select their seven candidates, or more if they so wish. I believe they vote for the candidates whom they know and, obviously, whom they believe will represent them the best. They then fill out the remainder of the ticket: they might do this at random or they might donkey vote. I do not accept when people vote under the Hare-Clark system that they are necessarily electing candidates with knowledge of all the options they have. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great problems with the Hare-Clark system is that members do not have an electorate of their own; there are seven members representing the electors. Quite often, that causes some difficulties in that the members who are elected to parliament-the parliamentarians-then have to serve an electorate that is, in the Tasmanian sense, often widespread geographically. This leads to candidates concentrating on particular parts of the electorate; they do not represent the whole electorate. In a political sense, some candidates tend to select small parts of the electorate that they are `representing', and they quite often tend not to go into other areas of the electorate. So there is a situation where Labor candidates tend to concentrate on areas which are known for their strong support for the Labor Party and vice versa: Liberal members concentrate on those areas where the Liberal vote is highest. I do not necessarily believe that is a desirable practice. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my contribution to this debate, I believe it is appropriate that the ACT should adopt the single member electoral system. I do not believe that we are advocating this for any selfish reasons. We are advocating it because that is the system which is understood most by the vast majority of the people-not just in the ACT, but all over this country. If we had our time over again in Tasmania, I believe we would have single member electorates. However, we have a Hare-Clark system and there is certainly no need, and certainly no practical advantage, in attempting to reverse what is now fact. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons I have outlined, I certainly urge those opposite to examine very carefully the ground that they are covering and the various aspects of the Hare-Clark voting system. It is not a panacea; it is not the total solution. If honourable senators opposite are not careful, they may end up with the sorts of undesirable results-as it appears from the attitude of the people in the ACT-that eventuated as a result of the now discredited d'Hondt system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition's view with regard to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill 1991 has, as usual, been carefully and skilfully put by Senator Parer and Senator Reid and I do not wish to repeat what my colleagues have said in relation to the substantive parts of the Bill. However, I rise very briefly to draw the Senate's attention to the report of the Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills about this particular Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the issues upon which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is called to report is whether any Bills, by express words or otherwise, trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. That is, of course, a mainstream of our democratic heritage; it is something which we must protect at all costs, at all times. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee exists to look at every piece of legislation which comes into this chamber, to see whether that legislation trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties. It also scrutinises the legislation for other reasons relating to the same matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The right to vote is of course a fundamental right and involves an individual being able to ascertain very readily whether they have an entitlement to vote. In this particular piece of legislation it becomes very confusing for the ordinary person, who does not have legal training, to work out just what this legislation will mean, whether they will be entitled to vote and how in fact the legislation will operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I say the average person would find difficulty: I might also say that even those with legal training-and some with quite skilled legal training-find an enormous difficulty in following through this particular piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. It contains in a schedule a series of modifications to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 in order to apply a large part of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to elections in the Australian Capital Territory, subject to changes effected by the schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us contains four schedules in all-three new ones. Schedule 1 proposes to amend the modifications which were made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act by the schedule to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act; schedule 2 proposes to substitute some modifications which were made by the schedule with other modifications; and schedule 3 proposes to repeal some other modifications. </PARA>
<PARA> That all sounds rather confusing, and it is. It makes it very confusing for anyone who is attempting to find out just what this legislation is all about. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee indicated that it was of the view that a person wishing to look up the electoral law that applies to the Australian Capital Territory would be left with a very confusing task. A person would have to refer to three separate pieces of legislation, including cross-referencing four different schedules, in order to establish what the electoral law is. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important piece of legislation for the people of the Australian Capital Territory. It is my view, and it is the view of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, that it would have been far better for the Government simply to rewrite the legislation containing the same form, but in one freestanding piece of legislation, so that if people wanted to know what their rights were they could pick up a separate piece of legislation, read it then and there and see what rights and entitlements they had. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, for some reason, has chosen not to do that. Why it has not done that mystifies me. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) suggesting that it be rewritten in a single piece of legislation. The Minister responded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision not to introduce a free standing Australian Capital Territory electoral bill at this time is consequent upon the fact that the Principal Act, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988, contains a schedule modifying and applying the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to Australian Capital Territory elections.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I note for your information that early drafts of the Bill contained only one schedule amending Schedule 1 to the Principal Act. However officers within my department in consultation with officers from the Australian Electoral Commission were concerned that such an expression of the modifications to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was awkward. Accordingly, Parliamentary Counsel provided a revised draft of the Bill with four schedules each listing amendments of a consistent nature in order to enhance the intelligibility of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be a rather curious comment. It misses the point that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was raising, and that is that one should not have to refer to three or four pieces of legislation to find out what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is critical that we, as citizens of this country, can find out what law applies to us and how we interpret it. I know there are a lot of things said at times about the high cost of obtaining justice and the high cost of getting advice from a lawyer. I can say, as a practising lawyer in the recent past, that a lot of the costs involved in giving legal advice are brought about by legislation such as this, where one has to sit down for an enormously long period of time just to sort out what the legislation is before one can then read it, interpret it and give advice on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as with any other job, in the law time is money and the longer one takes the more expensive things become. From that angle as well the Government should seriously look at putting this into a piece of freestanding legislation. There is a myriad of Acts around which have the same problem. It becomes an impossible task for anyone to try to advise on the taxation legislation with the continuous stream of amendments coming through. It just takes so long to find out where the Act should sit before one starts reading it to try to understand it and advise on it. That same problem applies to this Bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA> All too often, in our present day and age, the rights of citizens are being trammelled more and more. The Government's attempt to ban free speech with bans on electronic advertising is yet another step along that path towards restricting the freedoms that we used to have in this country. Those sorts of things should be opposed or drawn attention to at all times. That is why I rise on this occasion to bring to the notice of the Senate that this is very important legislation which relates to our fundamental right to vote, and is very important for people in the Australian Capital Territory, but if it was given to people in the street to find out what it was all about and how it affected them, it would be impossible for them, by reading this Bill-and the Act if it becomes law-to find out what their rights are. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to look at it again. The Government has a team of very well qualified and highly paid draftsmen who would find no difficulty in putting this into a freestanding Bill. I wonder why it does not do it. I urge the Minister to consider that and see if we can have a piece of legislation that we can all understand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill 1991. I do so as a member of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters on whose report the Bill is largely based. I was not a member of the subcommittee which was primarily responsible for the detail of that report. I speak also as an unequivocal supporter of a system of single member electorates, which I will return to later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I think we need to recapitulate on why we are here now and what has happened to bring us to the point where we are now suggesting that the next election in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) should be based on the d'Hondt system with some amendments, and a referendum to decide what the system will be in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside the long and convoluted movement towards self-government, and the arguments that went on in relation to that, once the decision had been made to give the ACT self-government, legislation on the electoral provisions was introduced in October 1988. The Bill was introduced against a backdrop of unsuccessful attempts to achieve, firstly, a single member electorate system which the Government at the time supported or, alternatively, and again unsuccessfully, a hybrid single member electorate system with a Senate-style proportional representation (PR) top-up-a single electorate which would top up the single member constituencies in much the same way as some European systems do. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of a failure to gain support for either of these proposals the Government was forced to look further afield and came up with the d'Hondt system. The d'Hondt system, I believe-and a couple of speakers have already conceded this point-is probably unfairly the subject of abuse because of a number of other factors in this last election which have led to some almost comic opera situations for which d'Hondt is blamed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a respectable system used in a number of European countries. For example, it is used in France, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Israel. It was seen by the Government-having failed, I remind the Senate, to gain acceptance for either a single member constituency system or a single member constituency system with a top-up from a Senate-style PR system-to be a unique system for a unique city State around which we might get support. It was acknowledged at the time that it was a compromise, and there were no bones made about the fact that that was so. </PARA>
<PARA> It also needs to be recognised that no electoral system is ideal. I think this was well summed up in the Committee's report where at page 38, paragraph 2.72, it quotes from Harrop and Miller, Elections and Voters: A Comparative Introduction:</PARA>
<PARA> To determine which of the available electoral systems is best for an electorate is a difficult task. No one electoral system is the best for all countries and in all contexts. A good electoral system can be defined as one that performs a range of tasks reasonably well in a specific context even at the expense of doing none of these tasks superbly well. </PARA>
<PARA>That is as much as saying that there is no ideal system. The Committee goes on to say in that same paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>Conversely a bad electoral system is one which performs none of these tasks satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier on in its report, the Committee tried to establish criteria for a good system. On page 16 at paragraph 2.5, it says that:</PARA>
<PARA>An electoral system should:</PARA>
<PARA>* result in the legislature that reflects the electorates' wishes;</PARA>
<PARA>* result in a government that reflects the majority opinion of the electorate;</PARA>
<PARA>* allow for stable government;</PARA>
<PARA>* ensure the election of members whose personal qualities best fit them for legislative responsibilities;</PARA>
<PARA>* be easily understood by the electorate;</PARA>
<PARA>* ensure a quick result. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, while making some recommendations for changes to the current modified d'Hondt system, also proposed a referendum. It did so because there were such heated arguments and entrenched views on the question of the voting system in the ACT and because it is a genuinely difficult thing to decide what is best for the ACT and, importantly, which system will ultimately have the confidence of the ACT electors. So that the referendum would be an understandable one and would not be bogged down in the complexities of the minutiae that are concerned with electoral systems, it proposed a simple choice between two alternatives, the single member electoral system or a Hare-Clark proportional representation system similar to that in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> While the referendum was not on the agenda following the Government's initial response to the Committee report, following negotiations it is, as you are aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, now back on the agenda with the suggestion that it be held at the same time as the next ACT election. The Government's reasons for not initially including the referendum were nevertheless sound. The Government was concerned that the referendum at that time was unlikely to achieve a definitive outcome. It was concerned that there was no guarantee that the results of a referendum would be accepted by the parties concerned. It was concerned also that the referendum would serve to regenerate debate on the merits of self-government, which is a debate that we have had and which should be put aside. Of course, it was also concerned about the cost of a stand-alone referendum at a time of economic restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> The current proposal to hold the referendum with the election is a sensible compromise. It makes more sense, given that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) also proposes with this Bill to hand over to the ACT the power to control the Territory electoral system from the time of the election onwards. It also overcomes the problem of costs for the stand-alone referendum, as the costs of holding the referendum with the election will be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to put the case for the single member electorate system. I favour it because of its simplicity. People know who their local representative is; they can identify with him or her. They can identify with the system. It is a system that most people in Australia know and most people would opt for if given a choice. Polls have shown this. </PARA>
<PARA> The main objection seems to be that Labor will win a majority. This point is summed up, I think very well, by a letter to the Canberra Times on 5 October last year by Hugh Dakin:</PARA>
<PARA> The objection to single-member electorates for the ACT seems to be that it would result in a large Labor majority. This would occur only if a large majority voted Labor, in which case it seems a curious objection to our electoral system that it gives the result preferred by the majority. </PARA>

Seats of 8,000 or so are highly responsive to local factors, particularly in a city State the size and nature of Canberra with a highly literate and politically aware group of electors. Any well-known independent or minor party candidate could easily win in a seat that is regarded as a safe Labor seat. There are examples of this even in larger seats in State general elections all around the country. The plethora of independents that were elected in the last round of State elections attests to this. When local issues arise, when there is a notable local candidate or when people are fed up with major parties, minor party candidates and independents have every chance of getting up, even in larger electorates than were being proposed in the ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In another letter to the Canberra Times Senator McMullan summed up the situation particularly well when he was challenged to show a former correspondent with the Canberra Times one electorate in the last election which could have given a party other than Labor a better than even chance of winning. Senator McMullan said that he could do better than that and that he could show him:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that on the 1989 results, a party other than the ALP would have had an even chance of winning 15 seats. Only two seats could have been considered to be safe Labor and even those relied on preferences from the Residents Rally. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to give a hypothetical example:</PARA>
<PARA>We could look at a hypothetical ``city'' electorate including Reid, Braddon, Turner, Acton, Civic, Barton, Kingston, Yarralumla and part of Ainslie. On the 1989 results after distribution of the unsuccessful parties (based on the actual distribution) the Abolish Party had 6.3 per cent, Residents Rally 25.8 per cent, ALP 26.72 per cent, No Self Government party 11.4 per cent and the Liberal Party 21.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming that the Abolish and No Self Government parties distribute relatively evenly or expire (as is probable given their registered tickets), then the Liberal preferences would give the Residents Rally . . . a comfortable win. </PARA>
<PARA>He says that this example could be repeated in several electorates, based on figures from the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> I am unashamedly a supporter of the party system, which has relevance in this debate. Any system in which parties exercise strong discipline over their members makes for more stable and decisive government. I think that this stability and decisiveness is necessary in developing the sorts of coalitions we need to make tough decisions in the national interest. This is infinitely better than a system similar to that in the United States, where parties have little discipline and where congressmen become populists responding to the parochial demands of local constituencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Classic examples of this in recent times in the United States are the fact that the Americans have not been able to cope with the deficit; the fact that they have never been able to cope with farm subsidies; and the fact that they have never been able to cope with drastic reductions in defence expenditure. That is because they have a group of members who are acting as local populists in their own constituencies without the protection of disciplined parties to give them the support that is needed in making difficult decisions in the interests of the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, the Hare-Clark system is not the ideal held up by many. While I could go into this in detail, it has already been covered much better than I could by somebody with a lot more experience of it in Tasmania-Senator Sherry. Essentially it militates against parties-which is the strength of our system-in favour of undisciplined independents such as occurs in the United States. It is a system that is specifically designed for Houses of review, and has a number of other technical difficulties to which Senator Sherry has already referred. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a need to recognise in relation to the comic opera nature of the ACT's first Legislative Assembly election-Senator Reid has already drawn attention to the fact that there were 117 candidates for 17 positions, that the ballot-paper was a metre wide, that we had parties such as the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party and the Party! Party! Party! and that it took 65 days to count the ballot-that these comic opera aspects and some of the aspects of the ensuing government, which have also been equally comical and best described in the 60 Minutes program of 7 October last year, are not totally a product of the electoral system. In fairness to d'Hondt, which has its faults, this is a product of any new electoral system. The modified version of d'Hondt that was introduced certainly has its faults, some of which will be picked up by the proposed amendments. I remind honourable senators that the first Federal Senate election attracted 50 candidates in New South Wales, whereas the second election in 1903 attracted only 12. Any first election will attract a range of candidates trying themselves out. There are some self-regulating elements in the second election and this pattern will apply in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not have the support for a system of single member electorates. Instead, as a compromise, it has proposed, firstly, a series of amendments as suggested and broadly supported by the Joint Committee. As has already been mentioned, those amendments go to raising the candidate deposit to try to discourage frivolous candidates and making a requirement that, in order to register as a political party, a group must have 100 members who are eligible to vote, which again tries to deter the frivolous establishment of parties. It also has a provision that individuals are able to register only one party and it simplifies the formality provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is a provision for a referendum to put to ACT electors a choice between single member electorates and the Hare-Clark system, as proposed by the Joint Committee. Thirdly, there is a decision to hand over to the ACT Assembly the power to control the Territory electoral system following the next election. In the circumstances, those are sensible compromises and I commend them to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that I need to traverse all the ground covered by honourable senators in the course of the summing-up. I thank them for their contributions. We should all be thankful that, at the end of the day, the people of the ACT will decide by referendum which system they prefer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, a couple of responses to matters raised by senators might be appropriate. In response to the comments of Senator Macdonald in wanting to put the whole thing into one Bill, I point out that the form of drafting of the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill 1991, on which the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills commented, reflects the fact that the bulk of the mechanical provisions applying to the ACT elections are the same as those that apply at Commonwealth elections. The Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 accordingly applies the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 with a number of modifications, rather than just repeating slabs of text from the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This Bill makes a relatively limited number of changes to the modifications which appear in the ACT Act. The position of a person seeking to construe the Act is really no different from that of a person who seeks to read any Act which has been amended since its last consolidated reprint-and, as we all know, there are a few of those. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of Senator Bell's comments in noting the position of the Australian Democrats regarding the proposed referendum being held as soon as possible and the preferred system then identified being utilised at the next ACT election during February 1992, I suggest that it is a matter of just being sensible about costs. Irrespective of whether he thinks it is a good idea, I would have thought that the great majority of people in the ACT would have thought that the stand-alone referendum, costing $600,000 more than holding one in conjunction with the 1992 election, would be just too much money. There is no justification for spending that $600,000 when it does not have to be spent. That is a position that the Australian Labor Party would share with the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I note Senator Sherry's comments on the Hare-Clark system as a whole. I have always found it a somewhat mystical system and not one that I would urge upon any elector. If the Tasmanians have it, that is well and good; I would not seek to roll back Tasmanian history. But I note that it has made no advance in lower House elections anywhere else in the Commonwealth. I would have thought that that is a very good thing. It is not a system I would seek to inflict on anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan and Senator Beahan have really outlined the Government's position far better than I could. I do not seek to add to their comments. I look forward to attending the Committee at which we might then iron out just what will occur from now on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1991 and Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 to be debated cognately. Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1991 is actually part 3 of the luxury car tax saga in which the Government has decided at last that parts 1 and 2 were a huge blunder and are best forgotten. As a result, the luxury car industry now finds itself reverting to the tax arrangements which were in place before this saga began. Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 implements a Budget undertaking to amend the wholesale sales tax laws to give small businesses and other small sales taxpayers the option of lodging and paying tax on a quarterly as opposed to a monthly basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In making this and other changes to the wholesale sales tax, as announced in the March statement, the Government is admitting that the present system is inefficient and full of anomalies. However, it has not had the courage to bite the bullet and to scrap the wholesale sales tax and to replace it with a goods and services tax as proposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.1) 1991 is the first in the cognate debate. As a result of the Government's March economic statement, we now have before us this amendment Bill which, as I said earlier, is part 3 of the Government's luxury car tax saga. This saga has been going on for almost 12 months. In May 1990 the Government put before the Senate the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1-9) to increase from 30 per cent to 50 per cent the rate of sales tax payable on motor cars and station wagons, including four-wheel drive vehicles, with a wholesale value exceeding $28,793. </PARA>
<PARA> The anticipated revenue gained from the increase was in excess of $100m per annum. It was anticipated to increase the total revenue raised from this source from $450m to over $550m per annum. Luxury car sales surged during the period between Mr Keating's sales tax announcement in February 1990-that was a election ploy I remind honourable senators-and its implementation in May. What a naive statement for a Treasurer to make! Sales during this period pulled forward and estimated $54m in duty and sales tax. Announcing sales tax increases in advance was a naive policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, when the sales tax amendments were debated in May, the coalition said that it did not believe that the increase in the luxury car sales tax would raise anywhere near the amount of revenue which was claimed by the Government. That is on the public record. The coalition also argued that it would have a negative impact on employment and on business viability. The Government went part of the way towards admitting that we were correct when it introduced the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) in 1991 in accordance with changes announced in the August Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect of this second Bill was to reduce the rate of tax applicable to lower priced luxury motor vehicles by applying a progressively increasing rate commencing at 30 per cent. The amended tax system commenced at 30 per cent for vehicles priced at $30,234 and increased to a maximum of 50 per cent for vehicles with a wholesale price equal to or greater than $54,419. The Government's reason for changing its mind in August was that the luxury car sales tax changes had encouraged wholesalers to adopt a number of undesirable practices to artificially reduce wholesale prices below the threshold level, in some cases by removing safety options from the vehicles. I remind the Senate that these are almost the identical words that I used about six months earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Many within the car industry had referred to the increased sales tax as a tax on safety, not only because it led to the practice of removing safety options from vehicles in order to bring down the price but also because it had prevented safety items on cars filtering down to the less expensive models for fear of pushing the price of the cars over the threshold and also making them uncompetitive. The Government also cited as a reason for the change the plight of primary producers and others living in remote parts of Australia. I remind the Senate that this point was very strongly made by my colleague from Western Australia Senator Panizza who, very emotionally at the time, pointed out the problems it would have for the outback. He is in the chamber today and no doubt will also remind the Senate of his prophetic words. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, in parts of Australia the terrain necessitates the use of four-wheel drive vehicles. The heat demands extra accessories, which in some areas might be deemed to be a luxury. The price of such vehicles places them in the luxury category, even though they are in this instance considered to be for day-to-day use rather than for luxury purposes. In other words, it shows just how out of touch Canberra can be with some of the remote parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two points that the Government did not admit to back in August. The first was the impact that the increased sales tax had on the sales of Australia's two home-grown vehicles which fell into the luxury car category. I refer to the Ford LTD and to the Caprice of General Motors-Holdens Ltd. Catching these Australian-made cars in the higher tax net and jeopardising their sales prospects was described by Mike Kable of the Australian as nothing short of absurd, particularly given the Government's commitment to the Buy Australia campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The second fact the Government did not admit to was that the increase in the luxury car sales tax had resulted in a negative impact on revenue. It is disappointing that Senator Walsh is not here today because, had he been around, he would have applied some basic economic reasoning. There is the question of certain products that have elastic and inelastic demands, luxury vehicles vis-a-vis common purpose items. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had to wait until today, since the announcement of the Bill in the August Budget, for this admission of guilt, fault and rectitude. What the industry and the coalition have been trying to tell the Government for almost 12 months has finally hit home. We thus have the announcement in the March industry statement that the Government has decided to review the higher rate luxury sales tax and to revert to the pre-May 1990 arrangements. If Senator Button had anything to do with that, I thank him for his part in it, because at least it has seen a return to commonsense and rationality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in announcing this change of heart, also conceded that since the introduction of the higher rate of luxury sales tax in May 1990 there has been a dramatic contraction of sales in this sector. Monthly sales are now running at less than a third of the level of the years before the tax change-surprise, surprise! This has had a serious consequence for the overall business of these motor vehicle importers and their level of employment and sales. </PARA>
<PARA> Vehicle importing is only part of the Australian operations of luxury car companies, such as Mercedes-Benz (Australia) Pty Ltd and JRA Ltd. These companies also have major bus and truck operations in Australia and are large employers of highly skilled labour, including many apprentices. The downturn in their car sales has put at risk these operations and their capacity to grow in Australia. That is indeed unfortunate. What a pity it was that the Government had not thought through the full implications of its tax arrangements before the initial announcement 12 months ago. If we put it in perspective, perhaps that is one of the costs of election promises that went very badly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill currently before us cancels out the previous rulings of the 50 per cent or the graded 30 per cent to 50 per cent tax levels, and the car retail and importing industry now goes back to where it was less than 12 months ago, but in a far weaker state financially because of what has happened. We started with a tax change which was going to increase revenue from $100m to $550m per annum. We then had an alteration which was expected to diminish tax revenue by $8m to $10m in a full year. Thus revenue was reduced to approximately $540m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) stated in his second reading speech that the reduction in the rate of sales tax on luxury vehicles will cost $15m in 1991 and $45m in 1991-92. I am uncertain from which total revenue base the Minister will deduct this latest reduction of sales tax; it seems that he is still looking at the total revenue of approximately $500m. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) may wish to give us a clarification in the summing up. </PARA>
<PARA> The last time that I had the pleasure, if it was a pleasure-I am not a vindictive person who is berating the Government on the sales tax issue-to speak in a debate such as this, honourable senators may recall, or have read in those speeches, I predicted a total revenue of only $280m for the year. Most car retail executives say that the market is now so depressed that their best hope-I emphasis `their best hope'-as a result of this Bill is for a levelling off of the sales decline rather than a widespread recovery. On this basis, my estimate of $280m, or 50 per cent of the Government's initial revenue of $550m, still stands. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the Government is highly embarrassed and shamefaced by this luxury car tax saga. At least this amendment Bill is a sign that there is still some belated hope-hope that the Government will recognise many of the other stupid decisions that it has made, and had the guts to acknowledge, and make some other appropriate changes. Regretfully, it seems that it is only those decisions which have a negative impact on government revenue that the Government bothers to admit to as erroneous and decides to amend. But what about all the other serious matters that have an impact on ordinary people and their lives?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology completed a report entitled Small Business in Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities. The report has been named the Beddall report, after the Minister for Small Business and Customs who was Chairman of the Committee. The Committee made some 60 recommendations which it believed would better the operating climate for small business. Several of these recommendations dealt with taxation matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment Bill before us picks up one of those 60 recommendations; specifically, No. 28. The Committee recommended that the Australian Taxation Office reduce the remitting frequency of sales tax for qualifying small business-that is, small tax remitters-from a monthly to a quarterly basis, with a view to reducing compliance costs for their businesses. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will implement that recommendation, giving qualifying small businesses the option to remit sales tax on a quarterly or monthly basis, effective from 1 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> I add at this point that it is a pleasure to debate legislation prior to its operative date because this is indeed a rare occurrence in this place. I give the Government credit for that because the last time we debated this type of legislation we debated it subsequent to its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has proposed in the Bill that the qualifying threshold will be $50,000 for 1991-92. For any subsequent year, the threshold for the previous year will be adjusted in line with movements in the consumer price index. I am yet to be convinced that the threshold of $50,000 adequately covers those traditionally placed in the small business category. The category to which I refer is the definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics of small business-that is, a business with fewer than 20 employees in all sectors, other than in the manufacturing sector where the figure is 100 employees. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the fact that some relief to small business is to be achieved in terms of compliance costs is to be welcomed. It will be interesting to see whether the Government, having now legislated to enact recommendation 28 of the Beddall report, goes on to recommendation 29 which, for those who are not familiar with it, recommends that compensation in some form be provided to qualifying small businesses for the cost of sales tax collection and remittance to the Australian Taxation Office, possibly by providing a tax credit based on an agreed reasonable compliance time spent in dealing with the sales tax paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepted recommendation 28 and has rejected recommendation 29. There is still an opportunity for a recognition by this Government of some of the costs incurred in complying with its legislation. A Government Minister has put forward that recommendation; the Government has not accepted it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other advantage which I see arising from this Bill, despite its limitations of sticking with the wholesale sales tax and not doing away with it totally, is the assistance that it will give to new businesses. This is a point that I believe is worth taking up. If a company commences business on 1 July 1991 and has a sales tax liability of $120,000 for that financial year, which is in excess of the $50,000 threshold, it will nevertheless still be a quarterly remitter for the 1991-92 year, though not for future years. This should certainly assist with the cash flow in the first year of operation. I think these are the sorts of incentives that businesses need in order to get off the ground in the first place, because lack of cash is the main impediment to small business at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I now have two concerns arising from this Bill, Madam Acting Deputy President. The first is the fact that the Government continues to fiddle around with the wholesale sales tax system trying, through various pieces of legislation and announcements, to address the anomalies and inefficiencies which plague it. As I said in my introduction, the Government has not had the courage to bite the bullet and scrap the wholesale sales tax and replace it with a goods and services tax, a new system which has the backing of the business community around Australia and of the professional community as well.</PARA>
<PARA> The second concern is something that I alluded to earlier when I said that I have yet to be convinced that the sales tax threshold of $50,000 adequately covers those traditionally placed in a small business category. I can think of two other changes that the Government has made in recent times which it has billed as assisting small business but which fail to affect all that fall within this category as per the generally accepted definition of small business. The first of these changes is the company tax payment requirements, proposed initially to begin from 1 July 1990 but deferred by Government amendment to 1 July 1991 or substituted accounting periods. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 July, companies with company tax bills in excess of $20,000 will no longer be able to pay that amount in four instalments over the year. Instead, they have two options: either to pay 85 per cent of the bill 28 days after the close of the financial year and the remaining 15 per cent nine months later, or to pay 100 per cent six months after the financial year's end. This $20,000 threshold is meant to exclude small businesses from this remittance requirement which will put a huge strain on cash flow, especially in the first year of its introduction. Small businesses which have a company tax bill of less than $20,000 are either tiny or certainly on the way out. Therefore, I do not believe such a threshold to be indicative of the level of company tax which a small business would be paying and it does not, therefore, exclude small business from the negative impact which this change imposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change that I refer to is the announcement by the Government that, from 1 July 1990, small group employers who pay less than $10,000 per year in quarterly tax instalment deductions will be able to remit pay as you earn (PAYE) tax on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis. Recommendation 42 of the Beddall report addresses this matter. The Beddall recommendation, however, was that group employers with an annual PAYE remittance of less than $100,000, not a mere $10,000, be allowed to remit PAYE tax on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Government were really serious about improving the operating climate for small businesses, it would have used the Beddall recommendation figure of $100,000 as the threshold figure, and not one-tenth of that amount. Likewise, if the Government were really serious about small business, we would have had more than two or three recommendations from the Beddall report acted upon by now. The support from small business for the Australian Labor Party and this Government is virtually non-existent at this moment. That is not surprising. When one looks at the sales tax Bills before us today and goes into the detail behind these Bills, one is not surprised by this growing lack of support. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago I received a letter from a colleague which illustrates the burdens and obstacles in the way of small business. I am sure that this is but one of many examples with which members of this Senate are really quite familiar. I will give an abridged version to demonstrate what I have been saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as a taxpayer who is attempting to do something in our country, I would like to inform you of my disillusion with the Government-Federal and State. </PARA>
<PARA> My current situation is (thus) following a trip to the United States I recognised a business opportunity for myself . . . The business concerned is setting up a chain of shoe shine stands in the lobbies of five star hotels; airports and even city executive buildings or arcades. With a Sydney based partner, I am in the process of forming a company `Shoe Shines Australia Pty Ltd' . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Since beginning to set up this company, I have found myself beset by government charges (State and Federal) which makes me wonder whether the Government is really committed to supporting those trying to provide job opportunities in this country. I give you the following examples:-</PARA>
<PARA> The first chair cost $2000 to be constructed. You add on the charges for registering a business name, (and) forming a company . . . and you get some idea (of) how I feel!</PARA>
<PARA> In order to construct our chairs we were forced to import, from USA, samples of the footrests that are an integral part of each chair. These are `cast' in a foundry-and samples are needed to make the mould. No such animal exists in this country. I find myself billed $43.24 (customs duty) and $67.08 (sales tax). </PARA>
<PARA> In order to provide an authentic shoe shine it will be necessary for me to bring in one of the polishes used in this area . . . I have been told that the customs duty on shoe polish is 5%. </PARA>
<PARA>The writer of the letter states that there will be an additional sales tax rip-off levied in addition to that. And these charges apply despite the fact that the goods are not manufactured in Australia-they are imported. I would like someone to justify to me why this person has been billed double what the cost of the polish would have been in the United States. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I am only `small business'-attempting to fight `City Hall'-but my current thinking is that our country is apparently bankrupt and attempting to take a bit of any opportunity for raising dollars-with no thought to the potential long term gains of securing further employment opportunities for its citizens, if people like me are given a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA>This example outlines the range of taxes, including sales tax, which beset small business nowadays. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is opportune to mention this at a time of a lot of government activity in terms of raising new revenue, a time of recession and a time of growing unemployment. Something must be done to assist small business to start employing people once again. I remind the Senate that this letter was written at a point of sheer frustration with the system, a point which many small business will have reached many, many times-perhaps one too many times and they have given up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is the party best placed at the present time to do something positive for small business. I think it has lost the opportunity that is available here today to provide some positive assistance. It has gone part of the way. But I think this is the story of this Government: its one step at a time is not bold enough and not big enough; it is too timid. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) amends one dire government induced situation. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) may give small business some hope but, again, like the industry statement, it is one of lost opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer that there is hope for more improvement. But I remind the Senate that it is up to the Government to get its act together and to have these potential improvements realised. Both Bills, despite their limitations, have the support of the Opposition. </PARA>

He gave us a whole list-the provision of additional finance for small business, advancing exports, providing additional assistance to research and development, and gearing up our education system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps we could also have expected this Government to take some measures to assist all those people who are now suffering from its engineered recession, including the wheat farmers that Senator Panizza represents who would benefit from a floor price and from cheaper vehicles. Four-wheel drive vehicles were mentioned. It would be a small matter to exempt from the increased sales tax on luxury cars such a class of vehicles used by primary producers. If Senator Panizza is interested, I am prepared to offer him my assistance in promoting such an amendment. But it is quite another matter to introduce measures which will reduce the price of Rolls Royces and BMWs, not to forget Ferraris. We believe that this quite extraordinary matter cannot be defended on the grounds of either social justice or economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I return to the mistaken motives behind the Government's decision, let me advert to some of the facts which constitute the background to this decision. A luxury car is one with a current retail price of $45,060 or more. It is the price above which the motor vehicle depreciation limit for income tax purposes is constituted. This line was established by the Fraser Government to limit the tax advantage available to business from the purchase of very expensive cars. So the road goes back to the days of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to give some credit to Mr Malcolm Fraser for recognising that people who can afford to buy cars for $100,000-plus should not do so at the expense of the taxpayers. The wholesale sales tax on all motor vehicles was 20 per cent until the 1986 Budget when a rate of 30 per cent was imposed on luxury passenger vehicles. That excluded utilities, panel vans, mini-buses and tray trucks. As I said before to Senator Panizza, it would be a simple matter to exclude four-wheel drive vehicles used by primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The luxury rate was then increased to 50 per cent on 8 May 1990. It was estimated that this tax would raise $105m in a full year. However, because of the vast increase in sales immediately before the rate increase and the sharp decline in economic activity since, a revenue shortfall has occurred, as Senator Watson has documented. The Government meanwhile had modified the all-or-nothing aspect of the 50 per cent rate by adopting a split rate system from the date of the 1990 Budget Speech. This has no great significance to the issue now before the Senate and I shall not pursue it any further. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent industry statements by the Treasurer and Senator Button announced that the luxury car tax will now be reduced to the pre-9 May 1990 rate of 30 per cent. The Prime Minister's statement made no mention of the proposed rate reduction. I wonder whether the Prime Minister was a little ashamed of that decision and did not want to associate himself with that announcement. In that context I advert to the statements-made quite frequently by Senator Maguire-that put the ALP's position on the detrimental effects of the consumption tax, and the examples, to which Senator Maguire quite often adverted, that it would put an extra tax on bread, milk and education materials but would make Rolls-Royces cheaper. Where is the social justice in the consumption tax, then, when we have a situation here that is completely analogous? It seems to me that with this measure, the Government has implemented a substantial chunk of the Opposition parties' consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The new rate will apply from 13 March 1991, and there are a number of consequences arising from that. It is estimated by the Government in its statement that it will cost $15m of tax revenue in this financial year and $45m in a full year. It is unclear how these figures have been arrived at, but that is what the Government has put on the table. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, there will obviously be a detrimental effect on the merchandise trade component of the current account. That is estimated, based on the Government's figures, at between $290m and $420m. Here we are trying to improve our balance of trade and trying to bring down our foreign debt, yet the Government institutes a measure which not only reduces tax revenue but also increases the unfavourable balance of trade of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us look at another effect of this measure: that at least half of that amount will now be added to the unfavourable trade balance-because these cars will now be imported again in ever-increasing volume-and the buyers of these cars, faced with the higher tax and the higher price, may well have decided to buy instead Australian made vehicles; so why--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator Panizza, all you have to do is look at the car yards in front of Ford, Toyota and Holden, and look at the cars that are being produced by Australian manufacturers with Australian workers which are available here through Australian distributors. There is absolutely no doubt that cars which get you from point A to point B are readily available in large numbers. Not only that: they are cars which it is acknowledged now are rivalling overseas products in the quality of the workmanship that has produced them, the engineering and the finish. We are doing a disservice by supporting a measure-as the Opposition does and the Democrats do not-which encourages people to buy cars which are manufactured offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's rationale for this policy reversal is that the vehicle importers-people such as Daimler Benz and JRA-also have major bus and truck operations and motor vehicle component operations in Australia and are large employers of highly skilled labour, including many apprentices; and the Prime Minister and the industry Minister claim that these firms would cease these other operations, or alternatively not undertake further investment, or both, if they are curtailed in importing luxury vehicles. The Government appears to have taken that threat seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder to what extent we can place some value on these statements, on these threats, because I note, from recent media reports, that JRA is now selling its luxury car trading division. It will, of course, receive a much higher price for its operation now that the luxury car tax has been reduced. All that is happening is that JRA will achieve that higher price. So, where and how will it subsidise its other operations? Senator Panizza is asking why. Obviously, its profits will be larger, the volume of sales will be larger, it will sell more cars and, clearly, its operation is, therefore, in much better competitive shape. It is a fairly simple economic pricing argument: if you make a higher profit, you will get a higher price for your capital investment that produces that profit. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all that will happen in terms of JRA, which is one of the firms named by the Government that is using its luxury car division to cross-subsidise other activities. So now we are losing that. We shall not get that cross-subsidisation. But in any case, is the Government suggesting-and I understood it to suggest that cross-subsidisation is a bad economic principle-that we should rely on such cross-subsidisation? This example shows that we cannot; that cross-subsidisation of this type is an extremely uncertain and unreliable reason to allow people such as JRA to reduce the cost of the luxury cars which they are selling. </PARA>
<PARA>To give the Minister some guidance as to the media report: it appeared on 4 April 1991 in the Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is another report that I would like to draw the Minister's attention to. It appeared in the Australian Financial Review in the business and investment section and it dealt with the Daimler-Benz Company, which is the other large distributor of luxury cars in Australia. That statement quotes Mr Bernt Schlickum of Daimler-Benz saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Future sourcing and export contracts will not be confined to the automotive industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to renewed interest in Australia as a supplier is the proposed amendment to the Federal Government's export facilitation scheme, a central plank of the existing motor vehicle plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission has recommended that vehicle import companies, such as Mercedes Benz, should in future be able to earn dollar for dollar export credits for value added goods they supply to foreign trading partners instead of the current 50 1/3 in the dollar they are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have further evidence that firms such as Daimler-Benz that are traders in luxury cars will rely not on their trade in those cars but on the Federal Government's laudable-and supported by the Democrats-export facilitation scheme. So the argument that the Government has put forward is rather spurious. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to look at some of the price reductions that will result from this Government's measure. The top model on the Jaguar scale is priced at $180,960. That will achieve a reduction of $20,220, therefore now costing $167,040. Similar reductions occur in the other lines. The top model in the Mercedes line will be available at $28,000 less. The top model in the Porsche line will be reduced by $17,557, and the top model in the Range Rover line by $11,260. These examples show clearly where the priorities of this Government are. The economic arguments have been shown, as I have outlined, to be quite spurious, and the economic justifications are not there. The social justice aspect of this measure is laughable. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure characterises the Government as a government for the wealthy, not as a government for the worker and for those people who are suffering under the government-induced-admittedly induced-recession. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1991. As with Senator Watson earlier, I rise to speak on this amendment with rather some relish, because I, alongside a lot of my colleagues, pointed out the fallacy of this so-called luxury car tax or jealousy car tax that was introduced on the run last February. Worse still, not only was it on the run, but it was during an election campaign. I know from what I have read that the recommendation did not come from within the Government; it came from an adviser outside the Government. It was a way to be seen to be hitting the rich and so it was a good idea to bring it on during an election to get some supporters of the Senator Spindler-type to vote for the Government rather than for the Opposition on this line. Of course, it was a sugar-coated pill because it was going to raise $100m extra to be used on road funding in regard to black spots, mostly in New South Wales and to a certain extent probably in other States. It was explained at the time that it would raise, as I have already said, an extra $100m. However, the explanatory memorandum we have today says that the cost to revenue will be $15m in 1991, in this financial year, and $45m in 1991-92.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it was introduced it was $100m and it sounded pretty good to be socking the rich for an extra $100m. And it sounded equally as good to be putting it into black spots-and I am all for extra road funding at any time. But I believe extra road funding should come from the fuel excises that we are forced to pay so liberally. But it seems peculiar that $100m was going on but only $45m was coming off. All the arguments that we have made along the line were correct. I would also like to know-and this is by the way-whether the extra $100m was actually put into place for those black spots, because it certainly did not come from the luxury car tax. Did it come from other revenue, or was it amongst the disposable promises made by the Government during the last election that have been forgotten?</PARA>
<PARA> I did ask Senator Button, the Minister representing the Treasurer, a question a few weeks ago, but we have not got an answer on that one. However, that is not the point of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had already backed down, as Senator Watson has said, on four-wheel drives used in remote areas. These four-wheel drives are used in remote areas for safety in people transport as well as for goods transport and children's transport to school and that sort of thing. Initially they were included in the luxury sales tax net. But the Government saw its folly and they were taken off. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Watson pointed out, there were a lot of things removed from vehicles to get them below the threshold. Some of those things were safety aspects, unfortunately, but other things were not totally safety aspects. Amongst those was air-conditioning. In most remote areas air-conditioning is not a luxury; it is a necessity. It is hard enough to keep people out there as it is without taxing those sorts of things that make their life out there a bit more bearable. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, even with this amendment and the Government having seen the folly of its ways, there is still a certain amount of luxury tax, or jealousy tax, on vehicles that are priced at over $45,046 retail. There is a discrepancy of 10 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, 23 March just past was a very important day for democracy in Queensland. It was the day that 2,367 citizens of that State offered themselves for election to the local authorities in Queensland. There were some 245 candidates for the positions of mayor and shire chairman of the various authorities throughout Queensland, and some 2,122 candidates for the positions of aldermen or councillors on the city and shire councils throughout the State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Local government-the third tier of government-is really one of the most important and significant forms of government that we enjoy in Australia. It is the form of government that is the very closest to the people. It is a form of government where actions are taken, where the matters of immediate concern to the citizens of our nation are dealt with by people who offer themselves and give of their time and efforts to make sure that the wishes of their communities are implemented. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And no reward, as Senator Panizza says. It is a level of government that is sometimes sneered at by the purists and the intellects: they indicate that it is not a quite proper form of government. But I disagree with that often held view. I think it is the most important form of government. It is a form of government that is directly and immediately accountable to its electors. It is a form of government where electors can immediately, without having to search around office buildings in cities or here in Canberra, get in touch with their local representative, the person who can do something about the problem that they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a form of government that is comprised of people who, more often than not, volunteer their time. Often they are citizens of smaller communities who are well known as being worthy people dedicated to a task and to their community. Local authorities are comprised of people who work simply to help their fellow man by making sure their communities operate properly. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Panizza has said, and I know he speaks from personal experience, it is a form of government which costs the taxpayer very, very little. There are no $60,000, $70,000 or $100,000 payments for these legislators. In many cases, these councillors work without any remuneration. In other instances, particularly in the smaller shires, they are recompensed only by way of a meeting fee. There are many elected councillors and aldermen who spend their own money simply to be there to serve and help their fellow man. I know. I was on a shire council for 12 years and the meeting fee we received for a whole day was considerably less than even I could have earned in a hour. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same vein, the former shire chairman of our particular locality was a medical practitioner. He could have earned quite a lot of money in his business practising medicine but he chose to devote a considerable part of his time to being practically a full time chairman of the shire for the benefit of its inhabitants. He did so at enormous financial cost to himself. Those sorts of situations are repeated throughout Queensland and, I am sure, throughout the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do these elected people receive little or nothing in the way of remuneration; they seldom receive any thanks at all. They are on call day and night, at weekends, and on weekdays during working hours and after working hours. Quite often, it seems to me, just as one is sitting down for tea, the phone rings and an elector wants something done. All of these things are looked after diligently and with good grace by these many, many people right throughout Australia who offer themselves to serve their fellow man. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland there are some 134 positions of shire chairman or mayor and some 1,188 positions of councillor or alderman. These positions are all filled by people wanting to do their bit for their community. And they do a mighty job. They devote their time. One can imagine what the cost would be to the public purse if they were paid for all of the work they did. If a Commonwealth public servant, for example, were to do the amount of work that these elected officials are doing every day of the week, weekends included, the cost would be enormous. But these people do it in a voluntary capacity. They do it well, they do it honestly, and they should receive much more recognition than they get. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland on 23 March some 60 positions in the Aboriginal councils throughout the State were also filled. There were 220 nominations for those as well. We do owe those Aboriginal councillors-in fact, councillors right throughout the State-a debt of gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA> People in local government, with the expertise that they have, should be more involved in looking at the bigger picture in our nation. I subscribe to a view which some of the peak organisations have put, that local government should be involved in Premiers Conferences and in the gatherings of the Prime Minister and the State leaders. I do concur with the view put forward that representatives of local government should also be involved in those forums of major decision making that affect all levels of government within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I want to pay tribute briefly to the former Lord Mayor of Brisbane, former Alderman Sallyanne Atkinson, who for 12 years did a tremendous job for the people of Brisbane. She carried out her role as a leader of that community with distinction and style. She worked ceaselessly to pursue the interests of the community she served, and she did it very, very well. She put Brisbane on the map. She made Brisbane a world recognised city, a city that is proud of itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Sallyanne and her team initiated much progress in the city. I do not come from the Brisbane area but on my rare visits to the capital it was noticeable that every couple of months new roads had been sealed, improvements had been made to parks and streets had been kerbed. </PARA>
<PARA> Sallyanne will certainly go down in history as one of the great leaders of the civic community in the Brisbane area. I am sure that Sallyanne will be back to serve again the people of her community with the distinction that she has shown in the past. I am sure that the people of Brisbane are already lamenting the fact that she is not there. I do wish her successor the best of luck and I congratulate him on achieving the position of Lord Mayor. </PARA>

He was not equipped for the job and he was not trained for the job. The ALP could not get anyone to stand there. All its high fliers-Alderman Hinchcliffe and all the rest of these people who think they have some future in ALP civic halls-were not game to stand. They were not prepared to throw their hats in. They wimped out the back because they thought they would get thrashed, so the ALP found someone-it did not really matter who-threw him into the job, and through a quirk of fate he is now there leading the team. And isn't the ALP embarrassed about that! As press reports show, he goes everywhere with a minder who tells him what to do. So he will need every bit of luck he can have. I certainly wish it to him, particularly for the sake of the people of Brisbane, and I hope that he is able to make some sort of a fist of the job. He has very, very big shoes to step into, but he has my best wishes as he moves into the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was an interesting set of elections in Queensland. Some people said it had political significance. Some idiots-people who obviously have no idea of the political system-were saying, `The Liberals have lost in Brisbane; therefore John Hewson is in trouble'. That sort of rubbish was the sort of thing that the ALP tried to trot out at the time. But of course, the ALP forgets that in the same election in Queensland there were a number of ALP councils and mayors who were also defeated, so it was quite an unusual election. The Labor mayor of Rockhampton was defeated at the polls. Some Labor councils were elected. While the Gold Coast runs as an independent council, the Labor Party and the people that support it were trounced there. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention the little shire of Cardwell, which is up near where I live and which is based on the towns of Tully and Cardwell. There, the sitting council was not popular with some of the locals so a team got together. That team comprised a well-known Labor man, a well-known Liberal man-the chairman of the Liberal branch up there-and a well-known National Party man. They got together, ran as a team, and swept the polls. So that is the way--</PARA>

<PARA> The only other political election campaign fought in Queensland in the local authorities was in the city where I have my principal office, Townsville. In that election the Liberal Party did very well, picking up a lot of votes in the area and increasing the number of seats it held on the Townsville City Council. I particularly congratulate the Liberal aldermen who succeeded in the Townsville City Council: Alderman Peter Lindsay, who has been there for some time; Alderman Jim Cathcart, a real stalwart who won comfortably despite predictions to the contrary; and a new alderman, Alderman John Francis, a local solicitor from Townsville, a man who will contribute a great deal of expertise and ability to the running of the Townsville City Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Labor mayor, Alderman Mooney, on his re-election to the position. Alderman Mooney and I had some tiffs in the run-up to the election. He got quite annoyed at one time and was threatening to report me to everyone-report me to Dr Hewson and other people-but that was all part of the election. It was all done with the best of intentions. I certainly do not hold it against Alderman Mooney that he has threatened me with all sorts of things. I want to work with him and I have told him that. He is the mayor of the City of Townsville and he will have my support, as will his council, in anything he does to promote the interests of that major city in far north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to congratulate the other leaders of local communities in north Queensland: Alderman Tyrell, who is the new mayor in the Thuringowa region, replacing a long serving Alderman Dan Gleeson, who had served his community with distinction; Alderman Pine in Mulgrave; Alderman Cleland in Cairns; Alderman Williamson, the new mayor in Mackay; Councillor Overton in Innisfail; Councillor Honeycombe from my town of Ayr; Councillor Rae Brown in Hinchinbrook; Councillor Patulo from the Whitsunday shire; Councillor White in Pioneer; Councillor Leather in Bowen; and Councillor Dot Bingham from Charters Towers. I extend my best wishes to all of these people as they take on the challenge of leading their communities in the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to congratulate all of those people who succeeded in the elections. I congratulate also those who were not successful. They certainly have my admiration for offering themselves for a role in their community and they deserve the congratulations of the community as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I want today to express again, briefly, the concern of many of my colleagues on this side of the chamber about the Government's failure to provide answers to questions on notice within the time specified by the Senate Standing Orders, namely, no longer than 30 days. If one looks at the Senate Notice Paper for the start of this week, one sees that it contains a very large number of questions on notice that have not been answered within that required timeframe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of my colleagues have drawn attention in recent sittings of the Senate to this slackness by Government Ministers.

<PARA>This is an important matter, because it reflects on the Government's attitude towards the processes of parliament and towards the role of parliament in our democratic system. There is no doubt at all that this Government has increasingly shown a disregard for both of those. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw particular attention today to two questions on notice that I have not received answers to. One of them was put to the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, and the other, through Senator Button, to the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Those questions were put on notice on 6 February; it is now 11 April, 63 days later. </PARA>
<PARA> The question to Senator Bolkus related to the Government's national prices network (NPN). In that question I sought further details of the Government's funding and outfitting of the national prices network. In particular, I sought details of whether the Government was maintaining its support of the NPN, whether additional staff were being provided for NPN activities and whether any members or senators had received still further additional computer equipment, staff or other assistance for their involvement in the activities of the national prices network. </PARA>
<PARA> That network, of course, is the Australian Labor Party's political propaganda tool, funded over and above Remuneration Tribunal recommendations for conditions for members of parliament. No coalition members or senators, of course, have received any extra computer facilities for the national prices network, or additional staff, and nor should they. The disgraceful thing is that there have been seven or eight members of parliament on the Labor Party side who are continually receiving additional computer facilities and funding for additional part time staff which is costing the taxpayer many thousands of dollars per year and which has not, in essence, been made public. </PARA>
<PARA> The information that I am seeking is really information to update the material that we have been seeking and receiving from the Government-under pressure, I must say, and in response to questions asked for a number of years in Senate Estimates committees and elsewhere since the network was set up. </PARA>
<PARA> Really, the information that I have requested of Senator Bolkus, who is in the chamber now, should be readily available to the Minister and to the Senate. I can think of no legitimate reason at all why answers have not yet been provided. I will be interested to see what explanation the Minister gives when I finally do receive the information. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue, therefore, in my view, is about why the Government is deliberately seeking to hide the facts on what it is doing to prop itself up at taxpayers' expense to enable it to increase its electoral appeal in the community through this propaganda scheme of the national prices network. What it is all about is Labor trying to give itself electoral advantages through the backdoor. We are seeing this par excellence at the moment with the proposed ban on electronic media advertising and in a whole host of other ways. I am very concerned about the failure of the Minister to provide answers to my questions. I ask again that that delay be terminated and that those answers, which should be readily and very easily available, be provided. This matter should not be allowed to drag on any further. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question, the one to the Treasurer through Senator Button, relates to grants to the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO). Once again, the material that I have asked for should be readily available and easily obtained by the Department of the Treasury. Once again, it is essentially an update of material that we have requested and dragged out of the Government over recent years. I am concerned about the level of funding that AFCO is receiving from the Government and, more particularly, whether that funding is being properly acquitted. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of AFCO accounting for Federal grants is not a good one. That is of very significant importance, given that we are talking about the use of taxpayers' money by an outside lobby organisation, a special interest group, and the fact that that funding comprises virtually all the funding available from any source to this consumer organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the money that AFCO has received in this form, we are talking about a considerable amount of funding for a body which is not representative of all consumers, as it claims to be. We have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the Senate and through Senate committees. For example, in 1989-90 AFCO received something like 95 per cent of its total revenue from the Federal Government and that ran into several hundred thousand dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> AFCO, of course, also wields considerable influence through being represented on many government boards and advisory committees. Answers that I have received in the past to questions asked at Senate Estimates committee hearings show that AFCO had representatives on 11 of these boards or advisory committees. But that was a gross understatement because there is other information available which shows that as at April 1989 a former director of AFCO, a Robin Brown, was listed as being on no less than 48 boards and committees. That is an enormous amount of involvement in a whole network of government advisory and other bodies by one person representing one organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> So, my questions regarding AFCO are very important if the Parliament is to perform its proper scrutiny of government funding and the allocation of taxpayers' resources. They are important also in determining the amount of influence that organisations such as AFCO can have on the general advice coming to government on a very wide range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about whether the Department of the Treasury is properly monitoring grants like the one to AFCO for national price network activities. There is a link there between AFCO and the national prices network. Indeed, AFCO has its national prices network funding provided by a grant from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Treasurer and his Department to ensure that my latest questions on these matters are answered is a matter of concern. I am certainly not reassured that the Treasurer and his Department have this area of their activities under control at all. Again, I will be very interested to see what explanation is given to the Senate for the failure to answer the questions in a timely manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not pursue the matter further at this stage, other than to point out again to the Senate that this is a very important issue, not just in terms of the questions on which I am seeking answers but more particularly in terms of the whole attitude of this Government towards the observance of the Standing Orders of this Senate which require that the Government responds to questions on notice in a timely fashion. But I regret to say that those Standing Orders are being more honoured in the breach than the observance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I would like to take the opportunity to talk about one of the few bright points on the agricultural horizon in Australia at the moment. I am talking, of course, about Australia's cotton industry. It is a little-known fact that last year the cotton cooperative based in Wee Waa in New South Wales produced in excess of $300m of export earnings for this country. That figure is roughly comparable with the export earnings of the Ford motor car corporation in the preceding financial year. In the same period, a small cotton cooperative can earn for Australia as many export dollars as Ford did with its exports of Capri cars to the United States of America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might well ask, `Why is it that the public does not know about the significant contribution being made by this outstanding Australian agricultural industry to our balance of payments?'. Why indeed. It seems that too much of the public's attention of late has been taken up by the manufacturing sector and not enough attention has been paid to the importance of agricultural industries in combating Australia's balance of payments problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing is that 20 or 30 years ago there was hardly any cotton industry at all in Australia. Cotton has taken off like a bushfire in northern New South Wales and in southern and central Queensland. This agricultural industry is earning us hundreds of millions of dollars every year-vital dollars for this economy and for the people not only of provincial Australia but of Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very grateful for the opportunity that I was given by the cotton cooperative to look around the gin, to meet cotton producers and to look at the way in which cotton is classed and shipped overseas. The classing of cotton is particularly important because the higher quality the cotton, the better the primary producer gets paid for the crop. </PARA>
<PARA> At Wee Waa the cotton cooperative is currently involved in processing and classing the cotton using computer facilities so that there can be very little dispute about the quality of the cotton and the characteristics of the fibre which is sent overseas. Of course, the higher the quality of the fibre, the better the export earnings and the better the money that comes back to the producer. </PARA>
<PARA> There is always a bit of an argument between buyers and sellers as to the quality of the cotton in question. It is intrinsically a subjective argument. This computer grading facility reduces the grounds upon which the buyers can say that the cotton is not of the quality that they ordered. Of course, they are still going to use this argument anyway in order to try to get a couple of extra dollars from the producer. The computer classing and grading facilities at that cotton cooperative are excellent. </PARA>
<PARA> People have always said that American cotton is the best in the world. Mr O'Brien, a classer at the cooperative who has worked in the United States cotton industry and is an American by birth, told me that Australian cotton is in fact the finest cotton that is produced anywhere in the world. He said that that is not just because of the micron count, the evenness and length of the cotton fibre, but also because Australian cotton tends on the whole to be very low in dirt and contaminants. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is not just in New South Wales that I have visited cotton growers over the last couple of weeks; I had the great pleasure of visiting cotton growers in Cecil Plains in my home State of Queensland and also cotton growers near Theodore in central Queensland. What they are doing is very exciting. The contribution that these people make to Australia's export earnings is superb and the productivity of the cotton industry around Cecil Plains is absolutely brilliant. We are getting very high yields of cotton of very good quality. That, of course, is a sign that progress is being made in the Australian cotton industry and that every year, barring accidents of weather, we can expect improvements, not just in the volume of cotton produced but also in the quality, and therefore improved export earnings for this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> What is absolutely critical, therefore, is that the Government does not go and kick the cotton industry in the teeth, as it has done to so many other export industries in this country. I hasten to add that we would be selling so many more dollars worth of agricultural exports were it not for the fact that the Government has an overpriced Australian dollar and this affects the export earnings of the cotton industry, as it has affected the export earnings of beef, wheat, wool and so on. It is absolutely critical that the cotton industry be allowed to grow and continue to produce export earnings for Australia. The real danger is, of course, that when you get a bad year-when it rains at the time you want to pick the cotton, or when it is too dry and the cotton is not able to grow properly-and the farmers' production is marginal, the added costs that the Government imposes on the cotton producers and the added costs that are imposed on the waterfront are going to take valuable dollars out of the farmers' pockets. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems we have on the waterfront intrinsically affect the value of the crop to the farmer because in an internationally competitive market, when every dollar and every cent of the price of a pound of cotton are of major significance, the added cost at the waterfront through lack of reform of excessive and unproductive practices not only harm the farmer but harm the community. I am very concerned, at a time when we have a rampant rural recession, that every single dollar we can send back to those farming communities makes its way there. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, it is an outrage that too many farmers' dollars get tied up at the wharves as a result of uncompetitive and unproductive shipping agreements, especially across the Tasman. It is of concern to me that the Government takes its fair whack out of the farmers' profits-hard-earned profits, I hasten to add-through its sales tax on the road freight industry. The 20 per cent sales tax on road transport is a major impediment to substantial improvement in the cotton industry, as it is in every other agricultural industry in this nation, especially with the level of fertilisers and chemicals needed to protect the cotton plants as they grow to maturity. The added cost as a result of the 20 per cent sales tax on the road freight to get those necessary chemicals and fertilisers to the farmers takes dollars out of the farmers' pockets and dollars out of those communities, and those dollars are lost to particularly hard-hit areas of provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the cotton industry is a bright light for Australia's agricultural exports. It is a shame and a damnation of this Government that there are not more substantially profitable agricultural industries. We know the reason why-we know it is because of the Government's failed economic policies-but we have, at least in cotton, a fine export earner for Australia, an industry that produces a natural product second to none anywhere around the world and an industry that we must all support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As politicians we ask people to trust us to make decisions which affect almost every aspect of their lives. The opinion polls tell us that people generally believe that politicians, of recent times, have let them down. To put it simply, the community at large no longer trusts us to act always in the best interests of the people. The recovery of that standing, that credibility within the community, will be established only by performance, by actions of politicians to re-establish credibility and standing within the community. Over the past four months I have witnessed a prime example of why people do not trust politicians. Yet again, the Hawke Government has been promising and not delivering. Because of Government action such as that, politicians of all parties are being branded as untrustworthy; that is why the standing of politicians within the community has been reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply want to put on the record what Senator Michael Tate promised, yet did not deliver, to the beleaguered citrus growers of the Riverland in South Australia. I want in doing so to let other politicians-and, importantly, the media-know that we have here a weak Minister who has caved in at the expense of a group of people who work hard for this country and who, sadly, trusted him to do what he had publicly stated he would do to help them. </PARA>
<PARA> As a senator for South Australia I have been involved with the problems of the citrus growers for some time. They have had enormous problems with fruit juice and pulp being dumped in Australia from countries such as Brazil. The situation has been made worse by the fact that these growers, immensely proud of their product, know that within that dumping of juice concentrate from overseas there has been-and because of Government inaction still is-illegal adulteration with inferior pulp wash. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australian consumers have been buying without knowing it, and because of this Government, is fruit juice contaminated with overseas produced, poor quality juice extracted from the peel of the fruit instead of the endocarp of the fruit-a frequent happening in dumped material from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia peel juice is limited to cordial products and is illegal for use in any other juice. But it needs country of origin labelling to discourage such abuse, which the Government and the industry both know is rampant in dumped fruit juice product. At the same time, industry research has clearly identified that consumers want to know exactly what they are buying, what they are eating and what they are drinking. In other words, there is obvious concern, and there is certainly consumer demand, for country of origin labelling. Last November Senator Tate thought so too. On 28 and 29 November, Senator Tate, as Minister for Consumer Affairs, put out two most decisive press statements. On 28 November he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian consumers have a right to know the country of origin of the foodstuffs they buy. </PARA>
<PARA> Some fruit juice being sold in Australia with the marking `Product of Australia' in fact contains only 25 per cent of local fruit juice. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the proposition that consumers are entitled to know the truth about the origin of the food and beverages they buy. </PARA>
<PARA>He finished off his press release of that day with the now almost laughable claim that growers will be encouraged to promote their all-Australian product, confident in the knowledge that any imported competitors will have to make full disclosures. </PARA>
<PARA> That was an admirable stance by the Minister. The next day, 29 November, he was still being the strong man. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The change in regulations will make it compulsory to show a declaration on the package of any juice or juice product to identify the country or countries of origin of the product. </PARA>
<PARA> And if there is a mixture of local and imported ingredients this must be declared. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate was so adamant that this was all going to happen that he finished the press release with the statement:</PARA>
<PARA>I expect the amendments to the food standards code will be gazetted early next year, which is ample time for importers and distributors to make the necessary changes to their packaging. </PARA>
<PARA>So what happened to all the Minister's fine words? Basically, they were not worth the paper they were written on. The South Australian citrus growers contacted me in January. They were angry, disillusioned, and rightly suspicious of political input. They told me that the gazetting of a national standard for fruit juice labelling, as promised in November by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, was not going to happen. Interestingly, my office checked on this through the Parliamentary Library, which in turn contacted the Minister's office. Senator Tate's staff denied there was any change from what was announced in the press releases of November last. But the citrus growers were right: it was not going to happen. They had found out, when South Australia gazetted its own labelling regulations on 20 December last year, that it was all rhetoric by the Minister. Those regulations simply required that, where fruit juices contained some imported fruit, this had to be stated on the container-not how much imported fruit juice was in the product; and they most definitely did not order country of origin labelling on the package. </PARA>
<PARA> In his press statement of 20 December, the South Australian Health Minister, Don Hopgood, alluded to a national standard to be announced the next year which would `bring in similar labelling controls'. The standard he was alluding to was the very standard that Senator Tate had promised Australians, just four weeks previously, would definitely, positively contain specific country of origin labelling, and nothing less. The citrus growers saw the warning signs. They wrote to South Australian Health Minister Hopgood, and he replied in February, telling them that many groups, including manufacturers, had decided that country of origin labelling was too expensive. It was a remarkable backdown. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet still Senator Tate was denying publicly that it was going to happen. When the regulations were not gazetted within the time frame that his staff had indicated to the media, by the first week of March, I asked the honourable senator, in Question Time, whether he was going to back down from his November statements. I suppose, in what you would call typical Hawkespeak, he said no, but yes. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It may be difficult to indicate exactly which countries of origin contributed to a particular bottle or container of fruit juice, and it may be sufficient for the consumer to know that the ingredients are imported. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat what he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it may be sufficient . . . to know that the ingredients are imported. </PARA>
<PARA>Why, I asked, was it suddenly sufficient in March 1991 to know just that there was some imported product when in November 1990 knowing only that fact was the very reason the Minister gave for strengthening the regulations to very specific country of origin labelling? I will tell honourable senators why. He was pressured to water them down, to back down, by another vested interest group within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It gets worse. I have received a letter which Senator Tate wrote to the Murray Valley Citrus Marketing Board, dated 25 February. That letter seeks to blatantly ignore, totally, all public statements he made on the subject in the previous November. Senator Tate's letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Your letter expresses a strong preference that . . . the actual country of origin is specified rather than allow the more general statement that the product is imported. </PARA>
<PARA>I can understand and appreciate your desire to see your stated preference as the only form of labelling. However there are reasons why alternatives have been proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate continued with a list of manufacturers' excuses about why they could not label their packages with the country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need to recognise is: if we can get a uniform set of laws applying in all the States in Australia, there will be no major additional cost for people processing orange fruit juice, for example, in having to include on the package the range of countries of origin of the product. So it is wrong to suggest that such labelling will be too expensive. Provided we get uniform laws for all States, which is an objective which we ought to pursue-I stress that point-the main part of the problem that the processors are confronted with, in terms of cost, in this country will be solved. </PARA>
<PARA> So, bluntly, country of origin labelling is not only essential but completely and easily possible. It is feasible. That Senator Tate should cave in to industry pressure about it supposedly being too expensive because different countries of origin need different labels for different batches of products will not wash. It will not wash with the citrus growers and it will not wash with the Australian public asking for truth in labelling. As someone put it to me, we go out and encourage people to buy Australian and then we are not prepared to insist that there is a description on the package that demonstrates whether it is Australian. As Minister for Consumer Affairs, he has not shown himself worthy of his position for he does not have the good of the consumers at heart in this instance. He has delivered us a prime example of exactly why the electorate views politicians with suspicion-promise much, deliver little; promise much, change your mind. I hope he realises the seriousness of his decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I am tired of hearing from the media that the Minister's staff say he was at the mercy of the State health Ministers. Technically he was, but only technically, for we all know that in practice he could have made the manufacturers toe the line by gazetting a national standard for labelling. He has not done so, and it does not look as though he will. In the meantime, the Australian public yet again is let down by a Minister not prepared to fulfil his commitment, his undertaking, to the public of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to plead for some sanity, not for some sanity in this place but for some sanity to return to the governing of my State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tasmania is in crisis. We have a minority Labor government teetering on the brink of collapse and we have the Green Independents, on whom it relies, set to move a no-confidence motion on a senior Government Minister. Such an atmosphere is creating an aura of great uncertainty in my State and it is affecting the business and community at large. It is time that this issue was resolved by giving the people of Tasmania a fresh opportunity to decide who they believe is the best equipped to govern our State. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two clear losers out of this present crisis: the Green Independents and the Field Government. Almost every week since Premier Field took up office the Government has been under threat by its former accord partners on some issue or other. The Tasmanian Parliament simply cannot continue to operate under this air of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> The no-confidence motion which is shortly to be discussed is aimed at the handling of the education portfolio by the State's Deputy Premier, Mr Peter Patmore, the number two senior politician in the present Labor Government. This whole issue places questions about the credibility of the so-called Green Independents. Early this week a no-confidence motion in Mr Patmore as the Minister for Education was moved by the Liberal Opposition. This motion, which was essentially the same as the one to be moved by Mrs Milne on behalf of the Green Independents, was rejected by the Green Independents, who have chosen to pursue some other method of attack. It is inconsistent to support one no-confidence motion whilst at the same time rejecting another which is couched in similar terms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that one way or another it will be shown that the Deputy Premier, the Minister for Education, Mr Patmore, no longer has the support of the State Lower House, and under these circumstances the Premier has no choice but to sack Mr Patmore or replace him with an alternative Labor member, or to accept the vote of no confidence as a trigger for a new State election. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, one does not call for a new State election lightly as there is considerable cost involved, particularly for the taxpayers. However, if an election is inevitable, it is preferable for my State that the issue be determined immediately. Further deals, further grandstanding, only continue to show both the present State Labor Government and the Green Independents in a very bad light. Should this no-confidence motion urged by Mrs Milne proceed in its present form, there is sure to be considerable legal debate as to the possible outcome. This is one further reason why the State Government should support the calls for an election. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the credibility of the Green Independents who are members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Yesterday the State Liberal Opposition education spokesman down there, Mr John Beswick, made the claim that the Green Independents were guilty of putting woodchips before children. It is this type of attitude which has characterised the Greens' behaviour since they entered the State Parliament. If they are serious about the crisis in the State's education system and if they are serious about the massive waste of taxpayers' money on redundancies in the Education Department only then to find the need to hire additional staff to replace those paid off on redundancy packages, they should follow this matter through. </PARA>
<PARA> Any member of parliament has an obligation to his or her electorate to give a commitment on all issues. We cannot enter a parliament simply to pursue a single aim, as the Greens have done. It is time for the Green Independents to stand up and be counted as politicians who are there to fairly represent the electorate, rather than opportunists who seek to achieve one-sided deals. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with interest that there has been some talk around this place about the possibility of the Greens forming an alliance with the Democrats. This idea is being welcomed in some areas of the Democrats Party, but I urge most strongly that those Democrat members who have any sense at all consider the matter very seriously before they make any decisions. They should look at what the Greens have done to Tasmania. They could very soon find their particular party in the same place. The Greens in Tasmania, since they entered State Parliament, have proven themselves to be unreliable and unpredictable. I would not see any advantage to the Democrats taking them on board. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Senator Bell has come here from Tasmania I have served on committees with him and I have found him to have a range of views on a range of subjects, which is more than I can say for some of the Green Independents in Tasmania. If such an alliance were to come about, I would suspect that Bob Brown, for instance, would replace Senator Bell representing Tasmania. Tasmania would not be as well served by having a single issue candidate in this place as it is by having a person such as Senator Bell, who has quite good opinions on very wide-ranging matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to congratulate the organisers of the exhibition One People, One Destiny, which is at present on display in the Senate exhibition area in Parliament House. It was opened by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator the Hon. Michael Tate, last Tuesday evening. I found the display most interesting, relating as it did to the National Australasian Convention which was held during March and April in 1891-100 years ago-to consider and report upon an adequate scheme for a federal constitution. This Convention was a meeting of 45 parliamentarians from the six Australian colonies and New Zealand, which met in the Legislative Assembly chamber of the New South Wales Parliament. I certainly seems to me appropriate that this exhibition should be arranged 100 years after the Convention for the Constitution was held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At its conclusion, the Convention had succeeded in drawing up a draft constitution for a new nation, the Commonwealth of Australia. It would be 1900 before this draft Bill of 1891, considerably revised, would pass into law as an Act to constitute the Commonwealth of Australia. Not until then would the six British colonies become six Australian States, united under a federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1891 these six colonies were still in search of nationhood. Their parliaments reflected the system of government inherited from the British, who had commenced the colonisation of Australia in 1788. But the predominantly British settlers, widely scattered over a continent previously owned and cared for by its indigenous people, the Aboriginals, had early established a large measure of political independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The draft Bill to constitute the Commonwealth of Australia, drawn up by the delegates to the National Australasian Convention in 1891, was the outcome not of revolution but of a developing sense of Australian nationalism and the practical necessity for the colonies to speak with one voice, rather than six, on issues such as defence, tariffs and postal services. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to outline a plan for a federal government was not a sudden one. The federal movement had been gradually gathering momentum throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, and by the 1890s it appears to have gained fairly wide acceptance. It was the structure of a federal government which now had to be decided. This was the task before the National Australasian Convention when it assembled at Parliament House, Sydney, on 2 March 1891. </PARA>
<PARA> The 45 delegates to the National Australasian Convention met during a period of economic upheaval and political change. Australia was about to enter a severe depression. A shearers strike threatened the wool industry-so it was in trouble even then, just as it seems to be in trouble at present, but this time not due to a shearers strike-and unemployment was rising. While the delegates to the Convention could be described as being either liberal or conservative in political outlook, there were also among them one or two radicals. It is important to remember that in March 1891 political parties, as we know them today, were not established. There were instead loose alliances of like-minded politicians, sometimes centred on issues such as free trade or protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The six Australian colonial parliaments sent seven delegates each to the Convention, each delegation being led by its own Prime Minister, as the Premiers were sometimes described in those days. It is interesting to note that there were New Zealand delegates there as well. They appear to have been more in the role of informed observers. There were only three of them. Apparently it did not convince them that they ought to belong to Australia, as it was known then. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the delegates had travelled around the coast to Sydney by steamer or train, and-would you believe it, Mr Acting Deputy President-they were all men. Women did not even have the right to vote, let alone to sit in the Parliament. Perhaps some of our women might say that they have not done too much better since those days. But at least there are quite a number of women senators, even if there are not quite as many women in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the delegates had been born in Australia. Most had spent the greater part of their lives in this country. All were in favour of an independent Australian nation, still aligned with Britain but not subservient to Britain. The youngest of the delegates was the Victorian politician Alfred Deakin, who later wrote that the Convention was `by far the most important representative gathering which had ever met in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I found it interesting that not all the work of the National Australasian Convention took place in formal debate or in the committee rooms of the New South Wales Parliament. When the Convention rose for Easter, Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, from Queensland, invited some of his colleagues to join him on board the Queensland Government's steamer for a working cruise down the Hawkesbury River. It seems very interesting to me, as a senator from Queensland, that in those days, way back in 1891, the Queensland Government owned a steamer. Now it owns an aeroplane. Quite a lot of the politicians in Queensland who sat on the opposite side to my husband were always complaining about the fact that the Queensland Government owned an aeroplane. But in those days it owned a steamer, the Lucinda, and it was decided that a working party would be held on the steamer. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very lovely model of the Lucinda in the display in the exhibition hall upstairs. It has been loaned by the Queensland Museum. I hope that all senators have taken the opportunity to have a look at the display upstairs. I think the folk who helped to put it together, Rosemary Lang and all the others, deserve a great deal of credit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very good that Mr Bartholomai, the Director of the Museum up there, went to a lot of trouble to send it down in a case so that it could be preserved and protected and so that it could form a very important part of this display. The Lucinda was the boat on which the members of the Australasian Convention went off to have an Easter weekend on the Hawkesbury. They left on the Good Friday and returned on the Easter Monday. All the people who went off on the ship were lawyers. They sailed out of Sydney Harbour in rough seas. Reaching Broken Bay, the Lucinda anchored in an estuary off the Hawkesbury River. At Refuge Bay some of the delegates took a shower under a waterfall-I thought that was rather cute-before they got down to the business of constitution making. The version of the Constitution Bill which was revised on board the Lucinda was subsequently debated at length by the Convention but few alterations were made. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it was not only on board the Lucinda that delegates encountered rough seas. The reason for Australia becoming a federation rather than having one single government lies in its history. What are now the six States of Australia were originally six colonies. None of these colonies would have been prepared to give up its political entity, but they were prepared to yield up some of their powers to a Federal government. Influenced by the Senate of the Congress of the United States, the delegates conceived the Australian Senate as the House which, in providing equal representation to the future States, would protect the interests of the smaller States against the heavily populated and wealthier New South Wales and Victoria. That is what the whole Senate has been about. That is what the aim was in those days. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the powers of the Senate in relation to those of the House of Representatives, the House to which, under the British system of parliamentary democracy, Ministers must be responsible? Early in the debate the astute Sir Samuel Griffith put his finger on this problem, which was to be by far the most difficult one before the Convention. He went on to say, `It is absolutely new to us that every law shall receive the assent of the majority of the people as well as a majority of the States. We are launching upon an unknown sea'. Happily, the delegates were not wrecked upon that sea. They came up with what is now known as the compromise of 1891. That was that the Senate would not be able to amend financial legislation proposed by the House of Representatives, but-honourable senators will be pleased to know-it could make suggestions. This compromise remains the basis of section 53 of the Australian Constitution. In all other legislation the Senate and the House of Representatives would have equal legislative power. </PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Convention was the veteran Premier of New South Wales, the Honourable Sir Henry Parkes. I have looked at all the photographs that are upstairs, and one that I was really impressed with was a picture of the lady photographer. There were not very many women associated with the Convention. I take it she was a lady because it says she was a woman-Laura someone; I have forgotten what her surname was. There is a model of her taking a photograph of all the delegates to the Convention. One never has any trouble recognising Sir Henry Parkes by his great big, flowing, white beard. That was very interesting. Unfortunately Parkes did not achieve his dream of becoming the first Prime Minister of a united Australia. He died in 1896 at the age of 81.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak once again on the necessity for a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. Honourable senators would know that I have been pushing for some years-I think ever since I came into the Senate-for a third runway. Each year Kingsford-Smith Airport has 13 million passengers passing through it. It employs more than 19,000 people and contributes about $2 billion each year to our national economy. Despite all those things, it is in a crisis and it needs something done about it and a third runway built. It is in a crisis because it handles some 200,000 aircraft movements a year and is at saturation level. It is ranked as the third most congested airport in the Asia-Pacific region. In good flying conditions it can handle about 60 aircraft movements an hour, but, of course, in bad weather this drops considerably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has been saying for some time that it will build a third runway, but having said that it has done everything in its power not to build it. We have had report after report, public inquiries, surveys, analysis of every conceivable aspect of construction, but still nothing being done. There have been eight separate reports on the question of improved air services in New South Wales and only one of those eight has opposed construction of a third runway. But, as I say, nothing is being done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Where does this leave Australia's tourism industry and where does it leave country commuters? Already commuter airlines have been forced into a peak period surcharge, which has resulted in increased air fares, reduced services at convenient times, and a subsequent drop in the rural traffic estimated to be as high as 20 per cent. International travellers are expected to continue to put up with substandard service, queues both in the air and on the ground, and a vague promise that things will get better. But what is actually stopping the Government from going ahead and doing something about Kingsford-Smith Airport? Is it kowtowing to the members of parliament who have electorates that border the airport? Is there a lack of commitment on the Government's part to really improve services for rural Australia and our international visitors? What really is it?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot continue to sit on the fence on this issue. It has already spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on acquiring land in Badgerys Creek. It has dislocated people's lives and businesses in that area, yet nothing much seems to be happening there. Yet Badgerys Creek is promoted as a reason why a third runway should not be constructed. The Government is allowing or promoting that the two ideas become intertwined and confused, probably in an effort to disguise its total inaction in both those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no excuse for delaying any more the construction of the third runway. It can be up and operating years before a second airport is constructed, and in any event studies have shown that both the third runway and Badgerys Creek will be required. We cannot allow rural services to decline any further and we cannot continue to have Kingsford-Smith Airport as the bottleneck of our nation rather than the gateway to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald spoke earlier about local government elections held in Queensland on 23 March. I want to make some comments about those as well. I support what he said about the importance of the tier of local government and the selfless efforts of many Queenslanders in this regard. I join with him in congratulating all those Queenslanders who have been elected, especially Mary Hopkins, the Democrat elected to the Inglewood Shire Council in south-west Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, not surprisingly, Senator Macdonald omitted to acknowledge one of the important developments of this election, and that is the emergence of the Green Alliance. The Green Alliance is an alliance of Australian Democrats, the Rainbow Alliance and other environment and social justice oriented people from Queensland. We should acknowledge that this city council election proved a very strong debut for this alliance. The Green Alliance lord mayoral candidate, Drew Hutton, attracted 7.5 per cent of the vote, and, as we know, the preferences of those who voted for Drew Hutton proved crucial in the outcome. Democrat candidate Bob George from Kianawah secured 26 per cent of the vote; Doug Yuille from the Wilderness Society, who ran in the inner-city ward of Paddington, scored 17 per cent; and Democrat candidate Andrew Bartlett, who ran in Taringa, managed 15 per cent. All other Green Alliance candidates achieved over 10 per cent in the 12 of the 26 wards in which they ran. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of the success of the Green Alliance campaign cannot be underestimated. This was a model for us to trial. I am pleased to say that it worked well. Very important issues had to be decided by cooperative action, issues such as preferences and where specific candidates would run. All of this was done on a shoestring budget with limited media coverage, and a very credible campaign was run. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some lessons for all of us in the fate of former Lord Mayor Atkinson. The first thing is that, as politicians, we need always to be aware of the difference between public perception and reality. We need to address ourselves to the success of smear campaigns which are run in the name of freedom of speech. To me, one of the great ironies of this campaign was that the Labor Party, which is proposing that we consider banning electronic advertising, ran really offensive television advertisements, and the Liberal Party, which is mounting a very strong support of what it sees as freedom of expression in this case, complained about these offensive advertisements. So the Brisbane City Council campaign was timely in that it has given all of us an opportunity to examine the power of electronic advertising and it has brought home the need to address honesty in advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Green Alliance, this new venture in cooperation between the Democrats and other environment and social justice groups, has forged links which will be strengthened by our good showing in this campaign and the experience gained from working together. </PARA>

What is the Government's response to the stated opposition of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to its proposal to ban free time offered to political parties during elections? Does the Government agree with the Chairman of the ABC, Mr Somervaille, that the ban could substantially reduce the Corporation's power and editorial independence?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's proposal will include a ban on paid and unpaid political advertising and free time currently provided by the ABC. I stress that the ABC's editorial independence in determining to what extent and in what manner it broadcasts news and current affairs will in no way be diminished. But the ABC, like all other broadcasters and users of the public airwaves, will not be able to broadcast free time advertisements for political parties. A ban which did not include free time access through the ABC would lead to an unfair position in that existing political parties would be in a position of privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having decided that the only effective way of curtailing the corruptive influences of increasing campaign costs is to apply a comprehensive ban on political and third party political advertising, the Government will not allow a situation where political parties have an advantage over the rest of the community because of access to ABC free time.</PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at recent years, the content of free time on the ABC has progressively shifted from party political broadcasts to recycling of political advertising that has been used in other commercial avenues. So for those reasons-the desire, firstly, not to have an unlevel playing field and, secondly, to ensure that the ban applies across the board in such a way that we can effectively curtail the increasing campaign costs to the political process-the Government has taken this decision.</PARA>
<PARA> I also stress, in closing, that the ban on advertising in no way impinges upon the manner in which the ABC broadcasts its news and current affairs programs, the way it decides to so broadcast them and to what extent it so decides to broadcast them.</PARA>

At present no application has been made to the Commonwealth Attorney-General by any Australian prosecuting agency to seek the extradition of Mr Michael Hand from the United States of America.

The carriage of that investigation and all the material it had was handed over to Mr Justice Stewart when he conducted his royal commission into the Nugan Hand Bank. I am informed by the AFP that it has no outstanding matters against Mr Hand. The only interest that Australian police have in Mr Hand is an outstanding New South Wales police warrant for Mr Hand's arrest for allegedly wilfully making a false statement on oath and knowing that the statement was false. That is the extent of the situation, as I understand it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an important question and I am sure that Senator Boswell is interested in it. I have a response here from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. To answer the first part of the question, the problems of the Australian industry are, of course, deep-seated and will take several years to resolve. However, the Government is heartened by the re-entry of both China and the USSR to the Australian market. We understand that since the market reopened on 25 February this year the Chinese have, once again, become significant buyers, purchasing around 10,000 tonnes of products so far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The USSR has paid virtually all the money owing from its shipped product. Letters of credit approaching $A50m have been opened by the Soviet authorities for a product which was contracted for prior to the closure of the market but not shipped. The filling of these contracts was probably prompted by the re-entry of the USSR into the market. Top officials from the Soviet wool importing agency Novo Export will be in Australia next week for discussions with the Australian traders. They will address any outstanding issues relating to unshipped product and discuss arrangements for commencement of new business. The credit arrangements established with the Soviets following Mr Kerin's visit to the USSR last November are available for use in respect of contracts for unshipped product and for new business.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the market reopened, the Australian Government has been pleased with the response of our wool customers to the suspension of the reserve price scheme, evidenced by the steady improvement in the market indicator and the higher level of clearances to date. The market indicator currently stands at 462c per kilo. The return of the USSR to the market will provide a further boost to market confidence in the post-Easter period, which is traditionally a quiet period in the year's trading.</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second part of the question. Under the credit arrangements in place for the USSR, all purchases of wool, both for unshipped products and new contracts, are eligible for credit. The details of any contract are determined through commercial negotiations between the contracting parties, and finance is available through normal commercial channels. The Soviet Bank of Foreign Economic Affairs issues letters of credit and guarantees payment on behalf of the Soviet Government. Contracts can be up to 240 days and the Commonwealth, through the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, provides a further payment guarantee. At this stage Novo Export is the single importing agency for wool in the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, should the USSR default or delay payment beyond the 240 days that are available under the credit arrangements, there is provision for the suspension of its facility. If payments are not made within four months of the due date the Commonwealth is liable for payment on the unpaid contracts. This does not preclude the possibility that the money would be recouped by the Commonwealth when the USSR was in a position to make the payments.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer that interjection because it is germane to the question. The question about industrial disputes is not that the market in a recession holds down the level of disputes; the question is also about how in the recovery-which this economy will go through in the latter part of this year and next year-the level of industrial disputes remains locked down and moderate wage outcomes are achieved. That is the vital element which has to be considered-not the short term political point which the Opposition wishes to make, but how it is intended to manage this economy in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go back to the record. The measure of working days lost per thousand employees-the incidence of industrial disputes-is virtually off the bottom of the graph now. It is 216 per 1,000 employees, which is still 62 per cent below the level of industrial disputes in the Fraser period. Tasmania had 67 disputes per 1,000 employees and Queensland 102 per thousand employees. Those States are the best performers in Australia. New South Wales had 280 disputes per thousand employees, which is above the national average. The size of the population in that State distorts the national average upwards. The figure shows that New South Wales has the worst record of any Australian State in industrial disputes. Yes, it is true that New South Wales is a Liberal governed State and that Queensland and Tasmania are governed by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA> An analysis of the industrial dispute figures shows two quite significant points that need to be brought out. The level of industrial disputes in Australia now continues to be well below the level of industrial disputes in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. As well as that, on analysis the figures show that the nature of industrial disputes, the cause of them, has now significantly changed.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past, about 50 per cent of disputes were over wages and working conditions and about 18 per cent were over managerial matters. Now we find that 11 per cent of the industrial disputes in Australia are over wages and 75 per cent are over managerial questions. Lest anyone thinks that that is an attack upon management, might I say that it is an indication of the focus of industrial activity. It is not under an accord about wages any longer; it is about reorganising work in the workplace, achieving the flexibilities of award restructuring, achieving the flexibilities created by workplace reform and ensuring that the workplace is made more efficient. There is never any silver lining in industrial dispute figures, but that shift in cause is a significant shift that shows that we are now grappling industrially with the problems of making the workplace more effective.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by going back to the fact that the level of industrial disputes in Australia is now significantly below the level of industrial disputes in OECD countries. On a comparison of the Hawke period with the Fraser period, the dispute level is now down by 62 per cent. On a comparison of the Hawke period with the Thatcher period in Britain, our dispute level is 30 per cent below that of Britain. The OECD average during the Hawke period of government was 270 working days lost per thousand days; our figure for the whole of the period is 250 working days lost per 1,000. Australia has a celebrated index, one with which we are belaboured constantly from the Opposition, and frequently a wrong picture is painted in the minds of our trading partners. Australia is an industrial quiescent country compared to the average OECD country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone put out a press statement yesterday. The not-so-rhetorical question at the start was, `Does Nick Bolkus think we are stupid?'. I think she has just answered that question. Two very clear points need to be understood and they are two that Senator Vanstone refuses to accept or contemplate in any way. Firstly, what we are talking about in terms of banning political advertising is not free speech; we are talking of bought speech. We are talking of speech that costs in some instances $13,000 a minute to exercise and which, in its exercise, is inherently undemocratic. That is the real problem that we face in this issue. We do not expect the Opposition to understand this, because the Opposition, at all turns over the last seven or eight years, has refused to accept any proposal from this side of Parliament or from the Australian Democrats that would in any way reduce the impact of the cost of campaigning, would ensure full and adequate disclosure and would lead to an open, transparent system of campaigning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone's question is based on the contention that we are infringing upon free speech. As I say, it is not free speech; it is bought speech. The level of one's participation in our community depends on the size of one's bank account. Let me just quote one conservative politician from the United States. His point is quite telling. It is a point that very much goes to the basic premise of the Government's position, that is, that our process is leading to a much more democratic, level playing field. Senator Barry Goldwater of the US Senate-no friend of mine and never has been-in respect to the costs of campaigning, which is very much an integral part of the Government's motivation, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It's not . . . the people . . . but moneyed interests who are setting the nation's political agenda and are influencing the position of candidates on the important issues of the day.</PARA>
<PARA>When we have that sort of recognition by a conservative politician in the United States and when we also have the fact that the cost of advertising is such that most of the community is denied access to the process, what the Government is doing in no way impinges upon freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me just make one point. This particular contention comes from the Opposition. Let us look at its record in terms of the area of civil liberties, of human rights, and whatever. It has opposed, at every turn in this Parliament, any attempt by this Government to enshrine in legislation or to enshrine in our Constitution a charter of rights for the Australian people. Regardless of whether it has been anything as innocuous as freedom of religion, trial by jury or fair compensation-nothing controversial in terms of the community-the Opposition has opposed it. It really strikes very much at the Opposition's credibility and highlights its hypocrisy where, out of this particular issue, it is trying to make itself out as the defender of civil liberties and freedom.</PARA>

On this side we recognise the inherent dangers in the political process and we are doing something about it to ensure that people in this community live under the basic system that protects their rights and their role in the community, that is, one person, one vote and one vote, one value-something that the Opposition has never respected and does not want to know about.</PARA></TALK.START>

If one looks at the cost of campaigning historically and focuses on some of the major increases in the costs of campaigning, as the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters did a couple of years ago, one would see that, for instance in terms of broadcasting, over the six years from 1984 to 1990 there was an increase in broadcasting costs from $6m in 1984 to $17.5m in 1990. In anyone's terms, that is an explosion in the costs of campaigning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I remind the Minister of a commitment he made while he held his previous responsibilities as Minister for the Environment. That commitment was to initiate an environmental impact study (EIS) into forestry operations in the Buckland training area in Tasmania. Such a study was felt to be necessary to answer questions such as: what activities are permissible in the Buckland training area; who will supervise such activities; what codes of practice might guide the conduct of such activities; and will those activities include such things as forestry, road building, other building and land clearing? I ask the Minister: when will this commitment to an environmental impact study, which was made in Hobart on 20 March 1990, be met?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not surprise Senator Bell too much to learn that I do not remember everything I said on 20 March 1990. I doubt very much that I would have used the phrase that I would initiate an EIS on the Buckland training area because the actual power of initiation comes from the action department rather than from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT). So technically the department which would have to go to the Minister, Mrs Kelly, on this question would be the Department of Defence. Nonetheless, on the score of the Buckland training area, I am advised that arrangements have been put in place to ensure that it is used in an environmentally responsible way. As Senator Bell would be aware, the majority of the training area is Tasmanian land. It has been leased to the Commonwealth and is administered by the Department of Defence for the Army.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth-Tasmanian forestry industry agreement of November 1988 made provision for the shared use of the training area and for logging to take place under the control of the Forestry Commission of Tasmania in all but the areas being directly used by the Army. The Forestry Commission and the Army subsequently agreed that a management plan would be developed. An extensive EIS covering woodchipping and associated forestry operations across Tasmania was conducted in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Army agreed in early 1990 that logging could occur in accordance with forestry management plans developed by the Forestry Commission, subject to an annual review and site inspection of the logging areas. I also understand that the Army is about to seek tenders for the preparation of a land management plan for the whole of the training area which would presumably build upon the forest management plan drawn up by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of what I said earlier, that the action to initiate the kind of thing that Senator Bell wants done has to come from the Department of Defence, I will take up with the Minister, Mrs Kelly, the possibility of her raising this issue with the Minister for Defence and suggesting to him that it is an important environmental issue and that the Department of Defence should refer it to DASETT to enable an impact study to occur.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and relates to the tragic labour force statistics which were delivered this morning at 11.30, showing near record unemployment, that the decrease in male and total seasonally adjusted employment was the largest monthly fall since the monthly survey began in 1978, and that youth unemployment in my State is over 30 per cent. Does the Minister not consider that this Senate, the people of Australia, and particularly the unemployed, deserve a fuller explanation of these figures than was given earlier today in answer to a question from the Opposition? Does he not think that we deserve some response by the Government as to the immediate action it will take to reverse this tragic situation? Will the Minister answer the questions that I have asked him over a period related to the fact that the problem and the crisis will not be overcome solely by a reliance by the Government on economic and training measures, but that action should also be taken on the social issues concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what Senator Harradine means by action being taken on the social issues concerned. When he has asked me about the social issues concerned before, and he has done over a long period, the social issue with which he has been predominantly concerned is the high participation of married women in the work force. Senator Harradine, having looked at the figures in respect of unemployment today, will probably have observed that the participation rate has fallen significantly in the figures which have just been announced; otherwise the overall figure would have been worse. This point has been raised on a number of occasions and I probably cannot satisfy Senator Harradine on the question of the female participation rate because I think changed social views have emerged over the past 10 years or so. I disagree with his view that it is an economic factor as much as a changed social view which has emerged over a period of time. There is nothing I have to add on that point to what I have said previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the rest of Senator Harradine's question, in the statement of 12 March significant Government expenditure was announced in respect of programs which had to do with the retention of skilled employees, particularly apprentices, in the work force. I have to accept his estimate of youth unemployment in Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the premise in Senator Harradine's question-let me put the matter that way-in relation to youth unemployment in Tasmania. I query it only because Senator Harradine said the figure was 30 per cent and somebody else on the other side said that it was higher. I did not know which statistic Senator Harradine's figure was based on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unemployment and youth unemployment have been higher in Tasmania for as long as I can remember. That is substantially associated with the fact that Tasmania does not have significant industrial employment. Sadly, many Tasmanians seem to want that situation, and that is something which cannot be resolved by the Government at a Federal level. Apart from those points which I have made, on a previous occasion in answering a question from Senator Short I have made a number of points relating to changes in Government economic policy settings which are very much related to the recession.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of Senator Harradine's request, as he put it, for immediate action, I have to be frank and say that there is no immediate action which can be taken or magic wand which can be waved by a government which will cure this morning's unemployment figures.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I just very quickly correct one thing that Senator Brownhill said in his question. The report was not due at the end of March. The commitment that was given by the Federal Airports Corporation, which is being discharged, was that the operation of peak period pricing at Kingsford-Smith would be reviewed at the end of March; in other words, after a complete three-month period of operation. I can advise Senator Brownhill that that is in fact being done now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trial period at the end of March, of course, has expired and the statistical analysis of the effect of peak period pricing on the airport is currently being conducted by the Department. I know that Senator Brownhill has been following this question because he has discussed it with me not just in the Senate but outside the Senate on a number of occasions. I will ensure that as soon as the report is to hand he will get a copy of it, along with other interested senators.</PARA>
<PARA> I stress, as I have done in the past, that the imposition of peak period pricing has been introduced at Sydney Airport as a regulator. It is not a revenue raiser; it has been introduced as a regulator. If the analysis shows that it has not succeeded as a regulator it will not be proceeded with. That is the position I have taken on this matter all along.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the third runway is concerned, Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd is currently hard at work engaged in preparation of the supplement to the environmental impact statement (EIS). That will be concluded, on current estimates, by about May this year so I expect that the Government will be in a position to consider the entire matter, that is, the complete EIS with the supplement, by the end of June or July this year.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA>Up until 1973 all social security pensions were tax exempt. The tax exemption for age pensions was withdrawn in 1973.</PARA>
<PARA>On 20 May 1976, the then Government announced withdrawal of the tax exemption for widows' pensions and service pensions other than those equivalent to invalid pensions, with effect from July 1976. The rationale for not also withdrawing the exemption for invalid pensions was not stated at that time. The Government has maintained the arrangements in this area put into effect in 1976.</PARA>
<PARA>The current cost to revenue of exempting the invalid pension is dependent on whether a rebate similar to that available to age pensioners would otherwise be made available to recipients of the invalid pension. If that was the case, the current cost to revenue of exempting such pensions is likely to be in the order of $20 million.</PARA>

<PARA> I think it is now quite clear to everyone that this will not be a short term recession. Indeed, figures released last night suggest that some of the major industry groups in this country are on the verge of a total loss of confidence. I think that is probably one of the most cynical aspects of the Government's response. On the one hand, we get this genuflection towards compassion-the suggestion that somehow it is unfortunate but nonetheless inevitable; but, wait, hope is around the corner-and, on the other hand, we get these cynical suggestions that things are not as bad as they could be. Even Senator Button got into this mode yesterday when he suggested that we had seen the worst. Of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told Caucus yesterday that, `There is further evidence that we are moving in the right direction'. This is, yet again, more cynical, misleading political pap which is designed to mislead the unwary and the very people who are the victims of these circumstances which have been created by the Government. </PARA>

I can remember how we used to get bagged for having the temerity to suggest that somehow what had happened three or four years back was the fault of the Whitlam Government. But now here we are eight years down the track and we cannot find a Minister who does not start off speeches by-the knee-jerk response-comparing current circumstances with what might have happened in the early 1980s. I think the Australian public understands that that is a pretty desperate and bankrupt response to a circumstance which is entirely of the Government's own making. It is no use trying to kill the messenger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Syntec Economic Services said yesterday that an industry survey has warned of another 100,000 job losses and unemployment figures topping 10 per cent. Syntec is respected on all sides as an objective economic commentator and it rejects clearly and emphatically the Government's increasingly optimistic view about economic recovery. I do not share the view of those who say that the response ought simply to be to throw more cash at a whole series of targets because, in many respects, that can perpetuate the problem. For example, if we were simply to ratchet up the list of welfare benefits we would have them locked into place even when the economic recovery arrived. I do not think that is the solution, but I do find it disappointing in the extreme that this Government's short term emergency response has been so pitifully inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson, with all his renowned or reputed political skills, ought to be aware of the opportunities which exist to achieve some recognition and appreciation from the voluntary agencies which do so much wonderful work in this country. They are the ones that are best placed to assess the effect of the current crisis and the impact that it has on the people who come through their doors. Yet all this Government has done to date is give out something like $7.6m in the Budget and another $2m recently. That is pitifully inadequate, demonstrated by the response of the agencies themselves. The Brotherhood of St Laurence put out a press release yesterday in the name of its new Executive Director, Bishop Michael Challen. Bishop Challen said:</PARA>
<PARA>The social cost of family breadwinners losing their jobs is enormous-and the safety net the Federal Government provides, the social security system, needs to heed the lessons of this recession. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to point out what I think are very valid facts. They show that even the Brotherhood itself has had to turn away 577 people asking for help-mostly material aid-since January of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is not overstating the case to say that the Brotherhood is recognised throughout Australia as an agency that is very well placed and very well regarded by its clientele, and it would be much better suited to the distribution of assistance. Yet this Government has not seen fit to respond other than by making available a miserable $2m some months after the need first arose. The press release continued as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In the first three months of this year the Brotherhood's two material aid services in Fitzroy and Frankston have given clothing and furniture to 4,809 people in need. ``Our supplies are limited and we cannot keep up with the growing demand'', Bishop Challen said. </PARA>
<PARA> Bishop Challen makes the very important point that it is one or the other. On the one hand, general assistance is provided through the welfare system so that the levels of rent assistance, unemployment benefit, sole parent pensions and the like are increased. That is basically the Australian Democrats' approach to life. It is a very expensive approach. It is not particularly targeted, and it would set in place a regime that I do not think would be of assistance in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> The stark alternative that Bishop Challen identifies is that if that is not going to be done-if across-the-board assistance is not going to be given-at the very least, assistance ought to be given to those people whose need is dramatic, to the point where they are actually going into voluntary agencies and asking for assistance. Yet this Government is choosing to deliberately send away those people empty handed. There can be no other explanation for the fact that this Government has refused to heed the requests and the pleas for help from a range of voluntary agencies whose reputations are beyond repute. If the Government can explain to me why it is prepared to condone the Brotherhood having to turn away 577 people asking for help since January, I would be very interested to hear about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fairfield City Community Aid and Information Centre in Sydney reports that it is in a severe cash crisis even after receiving its share of the extra $2m. The Sydney Morning Herald of 12 March reported that for the first time in the five-year life of the Sydney City Mission's Campbelltown centre, money for emergency relief food vouchers has run out. Indeed, staff at the mission agreed to a voluntary 10 per cent cut in salaries to put towards helping the destitute. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that Senator Richardson should travel second class to Europe or stay in youth hostels while he is away, I am simply suggesting that there are very obvious ways in which emergency relief can be provided in a manner that will ensure that it goes to the people to whom it ought to be provided, in the most efficient and responsible manner, and that that can be done with complete confidence in the voluntary agencies concerned. Yet that is the response we simply do not have, and we end up with the worst of all possible worlds. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a government that, on the one hand, makes a fleeting reference to the social consequences, then immediately turns around and tries to paint a dishonest picture of how things will get better and how recovery is around the corner. It is like, `I will fix child poverty by 1990' or, `Interest rates will come down just after the election'-a whole series of fraudulent political promises, and this is really just another one of them. If the Government is going to make those sorts of promises why can it not at least in the short term do something tangible and give some meaningful assistance to the people who need it?</PARA>
<PARA> There are reports that in Sydney some Department of Social Security offices have large backlogs of people to put on the dole, and such people have to approach the Smith Family for help until the DSS finally comes up with the first payment. Bishop Challen makes that point as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we cannot have it both ways. If there is going to be a waiting period for entitlement to benefits it ought, at least, to be recognised that even though not every one of those persons is thereby going to be disadvantaged, if some of them feel sufficiently disadvantaged-and they are probably the best judges of their own predicaments-to pay a visit to the local voluntary agency, then it should be ensured that those agencies are in a position to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard them as by far the better judges. I certainly do not think the Government has the capacity to try somehow to decide from Canberra who ought to get relief or, indeed, from the nearest regional office. Voluntary agencies are by far the best placed to make those judgments, but unless this Government is prepared to come to their assistance, then it is doing nothing. It is not even offering them bread. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry statement allows for an increase of 15,000 to 20,000 places in the labour market training programs, yet there are now 770,000 unemployed people and 596,000 people on the dole. The dole numbers that came out today show that the increase over the past year is 52.5 per cent. As Senator Button conceded, had the participation rate not fallen in the past month, the levels of unemployment would indeed have been even higher. We know that they are in fact over the magical 10 per cent figure in two of the six States. On a national basis they are higher than were predicted by the commentators, and most would now say that things will get worse. Even Mr Keating conceded that in the almost apologetic explanation that I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that he agreed with Mr Howard, the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, that there was no quick fix, that the situation would get worse before it got better, that there was a need to boost investment and restore confidence, and that unless we boosted our savings ratio none of these things would happen. If Mr Keating is in effect agreeing with Mr Howard that the situation will get worse before it gets better, there is a clear concession that the unemployment figure is going to exceed 10 per cent. If that is so, I think we all want to know what this Government proposes to do about the social consequences of the catastrophic economic mismanagement that has brought us to the pass. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that the Government throw hundreds of millions of dollars at interest groups-which is Senator Richardson's usual response to a perceived political problem-but, unless we get a sympathetic and at the same time financially meaningful response, not only are the Government's words hollow, but its actions underline the hypocrisy of its current pretence that things are going to get better. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when we have one job vacancy per every 29 unemployed people, there is very little prospect that any of the so-called initiatives announced in the last Budget will make much of a difference. The active employment strategy is virtually dead in the water before it is supposed to get off the ground on 1 July. The Government will no doubt pretend that somehow there will be jobs for most of these people, but the reality is that the bulk of the so-called active employment strategy consists of trying to entertain people, keep them amused, whilst they are sitting out of the work force indefinitely. That is not any sort of a sensible response, and again it is misleading. But at least in the short term, while these people are out of the work force, they ought to be entitled to have access to a much greater level of assistance than they are getting at present. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of statistics-particularly the youth homeless allowance figure, which has risen by 62 per cent over the past year-which underline the social significance of these current figures. I think my colleagues Senator Baume and Senator Calvert in their speeches will pay particular attention to the levels of youth unemployment and the consequences for youth. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard it as nothing more than a cynical response for the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) almost to claim credit for the increase in the youth homeless allowance figure by somehow suggesting that that reflects a higher take-up rate rather than the obvious implication that there are more people in need. I hope that we will get a much franker explanation for those figures and a better understanding of their consequences, because, unless the Government is prepared to face up to the meaning of the figures, there is not very much that it is likely to be able to do about the problem. Again we can see almost a 50 per cent increase over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also statistics that are very enlightening about the proportion of married couple families in the work force with at least one dependent child. The number of families in which both spouses are employed as a percentage of the total number of families has risen from 28.6 per cent in 1980 to 42 per cent in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> We can certainly say that Government members have a lot to answer for. After eight years they have no-one to blame but themselves. They clearly have no solution to the economic problems, let alone the political will to do anything about them. On the one hand, we have people like Senator Richardson acknowledging, as he has done for years, that the three-mine uranium policy is a disaster. But of course he is having it both ways. He is not prepared to get too far out in front, pretending that it is not a high item on the agenda, that he will not die in a ditch and that if it gets rolled, so what. </PARA>
<PARA> All those attitudes are a classic microcosm of the way in which this Government operates. It is not interested in the merits of the argument. This Government's approach is, `Who gives a damn about whether opening up additional uranium mines might lead to significant economic growth or might boost our exports'. Subject to all those safeguard issues that others might want to debate, we do not hear one word of economic analysis; it is all about what the factions will wear. That really is the response that we get on a whole range of areas that are encapsulated in the term `micro-economic reform'. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we do something about those sorts of problems and unless we can reduce the cost structures of business, there is not very much prospect of the unemployed and those who are increasingly getting in the welfare queues being able to look forward to any meaningful prospect of economic recovery. The tragedy is that those who are in their 50s, quite often with a poor command of the language and perhaps in a not-so-good state of health, are the ones who will be the permanent victims. When we come out of this recession they will still be on the scrap heap. Indeed, it is almost counterproductive to be spending money on training and education programs in a vain effort somehow to try to recycle these people. So they become simply flotsam and jetsam in the swill. I hope that Senator Richardson, in his response, will tell us what he proposes to do for those people in particular, because all that we will have is longer and longer statistics and more and more people being effectively disregarded and offered no hope into the bargain. Unless one tackles the problem at its source, is prepared to look at economic growth and actually tries to do something about it rather than shutting off the short term political problems, one has nothing to offer those victims of the economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that on two counts the Government has a great obligation to the Australian people. It has an obligation to try to tackle the economic problems and it also has an obligation to assist in dealing with the social consequences of that economic mismanagement. To date, it has failed to do both. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the Government will not argue that in a recession, with unemployment as great as it is now, there will not be pain felt by a considerable number of people. The purpose of a proper social security system and a proper training system for those who are unemployed is to make sure that the people who do feel that pain are caught by some safety net. The Government will be about maintaining and improving that safety net and not ripping it to shreds-which is the alternative that Senator Alston can offer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the economy was booming there was a need to dampen excess demand; no-one can deny that. The weapons available to governments, having already cut billions of dollars off government expenditure, are limited. Obviously interest rates constitute the main weapon that one can use in that situation. But, given the signs that were becoming evident of a slowdown in the economy, the Government moved to reduce interest rates, which have gone down by a total of 6 percentage points over the course of the last year, with a further half point reduction last week. Further to that, the wage-tax deal with the trade union movement in the wake of the September consumer price index figures, which has helped make certain that lower inflation is here to stay, has provided relief to employers in a deteriorating labour market and has created a timely increase in the fiscal stimulus flowing from the 1 January tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that these measures, combined with the cyclical developments in the economy, will see a pick-up in activity later this calendar year. To back that up from independent sources, today an interesting piece of news has come from the Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index. It states that for the second month in a row that index has risen. From that, Westpac has drawn the conclusion that:</PARA>
<PARA>Though it is still too early to say positively that the leading index is foreshadowing an upturn in the Australian economy in the latter half of 1991, the signs are promising that this message may not be far ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that the Government can say with increasing confidence that that recovery is on the way. In the intervening period the Government must ensure that those who are affected by the recession and who are unemployed have their skills improved so that, once that upturn does occur, they can take immediate advantage of it. Not only that, but as those skills improve the skills of the Australian work force at large improve. That is of critical importance to Australia's future. I shall have more to say about the active employment strategy (AES) a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> The labour market itself will lag behind other indicators of a recovery as has always been the case. I see no reason to believe that that will not continue to be the case. While we cannot expect any immediate sign in the labour market of that recovery, in accordance with the leading index from Westpac, I do not doubt that that recovery is under way. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's matter of public importance has as its first words:</PARA>
<PARA>The worsening plight of the ever increasing number of victims. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston would have us believe that he is very concerned about that worsening plight. He said that what was required-to quote from his speech-was `a sympathetic . . . financial response'. Judging by the records of Senator Alston and the Opposition over recent times, that is not what could be expected from the Opposition were it to gain the government benches. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Sunday, Senator Alston put out a press release saying that he would visit some Department of Social Security offices-a sign that it must have been a slow news Sunday. He told us all that he would be visiting the Parramatta, Marrickville, Redfern, Darlinghurst and Chatswood offices to see at first hand what was going on. Those at Redfern are still waiting; Senator Alston did not make it. He did send along a staffer but he himself was too busy. Earlier Senator Alston had turned up at Parramatta an hour late and his visit lasted only half an hour. At Marrickville things were a little better; he stayed for an hour. Apart from the regional manager, the area manager and a social worker he did not bother to speak to one staff member. By the time he got to Chatswood after lunch, a few other things were obviously on the senator's mind. He stayed for only 35 minutes, most of which time he spent on the phone.</PARA>
<PARA> I can understand why Senator Alston might have been unsettled or preoccupied on that day. He was having the classic bad day. It had begun when he was given a rather torrid time by Pru Goward on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Daybreak program. Some policy documents that Senator Alston had been working on had fallen off the back of the proverbial truck. Those documents did include some absolutely spectacular proposals. One might say that they were spectacular for their level of stupidity rather than anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of these ways that the Opposition will fix the worsening plight of the ever-increasing number of unemployed. The Opposition will sack 370 social workers and hand over their functions to the private sector. That is the first way in which the Opposition will actually help the worsening plight of the unemployed. It will dump special assistance programs, such as the jobs, education and training program for sole parents. This too will help the unemployed. The Opposition will hand over the Department's counselling service for the disabled to particular welfare agencies, to the corporate world, to whoever might take them-whoever the Opposition can find. The Opposition will give pensioners free bus concessions-that is good; most have them already-provided they will help in all of the voluntary agencies which will apparently be able to handle this great increase in the numbers who will be offering. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding all that, Senator Alston is considering how he will fix the worsening plight of these people. I wonder what his comments were in response to a question on the policy documents from Pru Goward. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, Pru, I'm not sure what proposal we're discussing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The documents have been handed around all over the building, but Senator Alston does not know what documents he is discussing. </PARA>
<PARA>I don't know what document you are referring to and that's why I'm talking in general terms because, to date, we haven't finalised the policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's attempts to finalise policies in social security and health have been going on now for many years with, I might say, a spectacular record of failure on the part of those who have preceded Senator Alston, the shadow Minister for social security, and those who accompany him now. Given that Senator Alston is not in the shadow Cabinet, maybe he does not know what is going on there; maybe it is doing the job for him or doing a job on him, I am not sure. But the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, has made it pretty clear how much he cares about the long term unemployed. His intentions are on record. In October 1989, Dr Hewson had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, most of the long-term unemployed will be expected to accept jobs that they would otherwise find unacceptable or live by their own means. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how the worsening plight of people in this recession will be helped by the Opposition. But, of course, Dr Hewson is an absolute St Augustine compared with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Reith. Mr Reith is a real special. He has the cure; it is all fixed. He says that all that is required is a $1.5 billion cut in social security. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter how one attempts to camouflage that. I give Senator Alston credit in that at least he has dropped the rather pathetic defence that there was some other additional special benefit that these people might get after Mr Reith pushed them off dole queues after nine months by saying that they could get nothing. Mr Reith has decided that if we just stop counting and helping the unemployed we will help their worsening plight. That is what people, if they are not doing well in this society, can expect from an opposition like the one we now have. It stands here today and expresses concern for the worsening plight of the unemployed while, at the same time, it is prepared absolutely as soon as it gets into government to cut them all off at the knees and make sure that anyone who has a benefit for over nine months or longer is unable to keep it. </PARA>
<PARA> As bad times develop cyclically, one wonders how many people today would end up receiving nothing; how many would have to live by their own means, by the Hewson-Reith-Alston trade-off. The sad fact is that hundreds of thousands of Australian families, who are by no means living on a bed or roses today, would finish up with absolutely nothing under the kind of hard line, right wing nonsense that these people preach. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the kind of economic scenario which Senator Alston and his colleagues have in mind for the worsening plight of the unemployed. Of course, economics is not Senator Alston's forte; I am trying to work out what is. In the same program with Pru Goward on that fateful Monday a couple of weeks ago, Senator Alston did not have a clue how much privatisation version No. 2 will cost. We do not really hear about privatisation version No. 1 any more. In that version, Mr Hewson suggested that the payment of welfare benefits could actually--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dr Hewson. I stand corrected. I thank Senator Faulkner. Dr Hewson suggested that the payment of welfare benefits could actually be privatised. He would have people racing into the marbled foyers of the offices of some of the better accountants in Australia asking for assistance. Of course, Dr Hewson and Senator Alston now claim that they never really suggested that. The laugh is that they are on record so many times doing that. In an interview in the Sunday Sun on 11 October last year, Dr Hewson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I think the most effective level for distributing welfare benefits are . . . those at the coalface.</PARA>
<PARA>So privatisation mark 2 is: selling off everything else except the actual payment of the benefits. I think we all are prepared to acknowledge that Maggie Thatcher is the high priestess of the government sell-off. She looked at social welfare privatisation in the same way that the Opposition is looking at it but, fortunately, around her were some more reasonable and rational beings who talked her out of doing anything more than looking at a couple of minor computer and administrative functions and selling them off. Even conservatives in Britain understood that one just cannot go further than that.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Liberals in Australia are about the only ones who believe that that is the way to create a fair and just society into the next century and the way to ease the worsening plight of those affected by this recession. This is the free market version of welfare economics. Senator Alston clearly thinks that the forces of demand and supply can do the job that his Party wants to bale out of. He told Pru Goward:</PARA>
<PARA>The principle that I'm confident we'll adopt is that wherever it is possible to identify a service that is currently carried out in the public sector that we believe could be carried out just as efficiently in the private sector, then we would move in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that we are talking about the worsening plight of people in a recession, let us ask ourselves what people at the coalface think about this welfare rationalism. It has to be said that Merle Mitchell from the Australian Council of Social Service did not seem to be too keen. On the same day she said to Pru Goward:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it would be impossible Pru. To start off with, social security needs its social workers to deal with the crises that come through the door . . . they need to be there on the spot . . . they must stay . . . they're desperately needed. </PARA>
<PARA>Merle Mitchell pointed out how ludicrous it was to expect pensioners to help out on a part time or volunteer basis. She pointed out that counselling and training programs to help people back into the work force require staff with a high level of training, skill and knowledge. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We certainly couldn't do it with volunteers . . . it must be done with people who have training and experience. </PARA>
<PARA>All this exposes the kind of lunacy and humbug that the Opposition comes up with when it says it cares about the victims of economic mismanagement and their worsening plight. All that has been demonstrated today and in the repeated statements by Senator Alston, Dr Hewson and Mr Reith is that they have absolutely no care, no concern, for those who are going to rely on government welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite probably have not noticed that our social security system has been changing in recent years to try to do an even better job. We have attempted to better target some of our programs to minimise fraud. Most importantly-I said that I would refer to the active employment strategy-we have tried to do something about giving people a hope for the future by improving their skills and training. I want to quote Senator Alston again, although I am not trying to take Hansard's job. He said that the AES was dead in the water before 1 July and, in any event, all it was doing was `trying to entertain them, to keep them amused'. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that trying to improve the skills of the Australian work force and trying to give those who are unemployed now more skills so they can take the first available opportunity to get a job when the recession is over was not just the duty of a government wanting to look after the worsening plight of those affected by a recession. It is something that all of us need to happen for the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The kinds of productivity gains that we need to get in Australia over the next few years or decades will not come without a much better skilled work force. While we have had remarkable success during the eight years in government in improving retention rates in schools and improving the skills of school leavers, for those who are already in the work force there will not be any other way than an active employment strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I was most concerned to hear Senator Alston speak in the way that he did today about that strategy. It will not matter which party is in government. If that strategy is not kept on and is not continually improved and updated, as it was in the industry statement of only a few weeks ago, I wonder what kind of future Australia can have. It behoves every one of us-it does not matter which political party we are in-to make sure that the skills of the work force are honed and improved. That means that for those who are unemployed, who are seeking entry to the work force, there is an even bigger job to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the actual payments themselves-not just the level of benefits, but the package that goes with them-one sees that there have been some remarkable improvements during the last eight years. Let us take rent assistance being extended to unemployment beneficiaries who are in private accommodation. The rates of rent assistance have been increased enormously in real terms over recent years-by 139 per cent for families with three or more children; 109 per cent for families with one to two children; and 79 per cent for people without them. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very big real increases, way in excess of inflation in the past three years. They are the kinds of things that demonstrate a commitment to wanting to ease the worsening plight of these people. I would not pretend for a second that what we have done in that respect and with a whole range of other programs has finished the job, but I am absolutely certain that the job is well and truly under way. I noticed another reference to youth homelessness from Senator Alston, who said that I had been claiming credit for the increase in the numbers yet it was really a reflection of the fact that more and more children were leaving home. I have taken the time to go out and meet homeless kids on their ground during the past few weeks with the Brotherhood of St Laurence and other welfare agencies. </PARA>

As one sits down and talks to kids who, even at the age of 15, have been on the streets for three or four years, one has to understand that these kids came onto the streets during times of economic boom. They did not go on the street yesterday, although kids are going on the street all the time. There is a massive social problem here. The States are walking away from it. The State ward system has virtually broken down in every State in Australia. There is no supervision, no help for these kids in that system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will be the Commonwealth's job to work with the States to help the lot of those kids. The very first step has to be to make sure that as many of them as we can get onto the youth homelessness allowance. That is what we have to do. We have to increase the numbers who are on the allowance because, with 4,000-odd on the allowance now, we are barely scratching the surface. I do not think that in the next few moments we can establish how many kids there are, but there are many, far too many. Unless we do something for them, unless we fix up their worsening plight, we are walking away from one of our worst social problems. That is all far too serious to be dealt with in a trite manner by talking about the worsening plight of the unemployed while seeking to cut hundreds of thousands of Australian families off all benefits just because they have been unemployed for nine months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we are discussing in this chamber, on the initiative of the Opposition, the consequences for ordinary Australians of this Government's economic policies and, in turn, the effect of its social policies. Once again I say that, while there certainly is no doubt that ordinary Australians are really suffering during this recession, we have to look at the Opposition's policies. Once again I stress, particularly after listening to Senator Alston's selective quotations from the Brotherhood of St Laurence material, which was available yesterday and from which I will quote extensively later, that the Opposition does not have anything better to offer by way of social policies. In fact, the majority of Australian families who are now being hit hard would be hit just as hard under the Opposition's policies, and indeed are being hit hard now because the Opposition supported those very policies as they went through this place. Opposition members have been accomplices of this Government because of their failure to oppose many of the social security measures which have caused further suffering to those Australians who are already bearing the brunt of this recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my relatively short time in this chamber, I have seen the Opposition support the Government on a range of measures that have all undoubtedly contributed to the worsening plight of the ever-increasing number of victims of this recession. Australians suffering as a consequence of this recession should ask, `What has the Opposition been doing?', as through this place we saw the increasing waiting times for young unemployed people trying to access any sort of benefit. What did the Opposition do when the assets test on the family allowance supplement for farmers was put before this chamber and, indeed, could have been removed? What has the Opposition done specifically on policies for young homeless people? Where is the benefit to low income families and rural Australian families in policies that call for the total deregulation and privatisation of our transport, health, financial and communication systems? Where is the benefit to them in being cut off unemployment benefits, as Senator Richardson has highlighted, after nine months? Where is the benefit in an across-the-board flat rate consumption tax that taxes the necessities of life at the same rate as luxury goods? Certainly, I see no benefit at all to low income Australians in the massive cuts in public expenditure that the Opposition has proposed. However, I do not want to spend any more time on that matter because I do not want to let the Government off the hook for what is a major social problem. Yet, as Senator Richardson highlighted, there have been a number of promising and positive steps taken by the Government. Unfortunately, while some small benefits have increased for those in need, poverty has also increased, and dramatically. What good steps the Government has taken have been far outweighed by the hurdles and difficulties put in place so that people have greater and greater problems accessing any form of support. The Government should be deeply ashamed of the effects of its economic policies on those people who, generation after generation, have always given the Australian Labor Party their support on the understanding that it would protect the interests of ordinary Australian workers. But I must add that those who are disillusioned with the Government's policies should not expect the Opposition parties to rally to their cause. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the unemployment figures that we are specifically discussing today. These are certainly damning figures which graphically illustrate the suffering of ordinary Australians under the Labor Government. Let us start to acknowledge that we are talking about people, real people, not just numbers on pieces of paper. We are talking about people who desperately want to find work but are not able to do so. Too often the term `unemployed' is bandied about and we forget that we are talking about Australians, workers who are out of the paid work force. Some 770,100 people are now unemployed-that is 9.2 per cent-the highest figure since April 1984. Australia has just had its worst one-month job losses since the Australian Bureau of Statistics started collecting these figures in 1978. This country lost 82,400 jobs in March, and that is the worst figure for 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures should shatter once and for all the notion that unemployed people do not really want to work, that they are having a good time going to the beach and watching television. They desperately want to work. Hundreds and hundreds of people across this country are applying for average skill jobs and low skill jobs. Yet unfortunately we still have an Opposition that talks about getting rid of unemployment benefits after nine months. A total of 596,890 people are on unemployment benefits, so we certainly have exceeded the Government's estimate in the Budget of 475,000. These figures need little elaboration; they speak for themselves of the great hardship being experienced by a substantial section of the community, particularly the half a million families who are now directly affected by unemployment. This gives added weight to the Australian Council of Social Service predictions that by the middle of 1991 we would have a million Australians, including a quarter of a million children, dependent on unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to look now at two particularly alarming statistics that were released today. First, 43,600 people, the vast majority of whom-over 30,000-are women, have given up looking for work altogether. In other words, they are now falling off the statistics. They are not on unemployment benefits; they have simply given up. They have been unsuccessful time and time again. They have seen no advertisements for jobs that they could possibly apply for. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out in this chamber before, the official unemployment figures fail to acknowledge the growing number of hidden unemployed-people who cannot access the paid work force. Here we have 43,000 people who by and large now will be overlooked by this Government in terms of any support services. A further example of the hidden unemployment is the fact that Australia has a growing number of underemployed. I wish to quote from an article in the Adelaide Advertiser of yesterday entitled `Part time workers seeking lift in hours', written by Shane Rodgers. In his article he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Bureau of Statistics said yesterday that there were 383,200 part-time workers in February who wanted to work more hours. Of those 144,700 were actively looking for full-time work. The number who preferred to work more hours was up 30,000 in January and was nearly 100,000 higher than 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, what despair and suffering are behind these figures? What will be the ultimate economic and social cost to this country of the failure to keep these people active in the labour force, in jobs that they find rewarding?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I wish to look at the teenage unemployment figures. These jumped 3.1 per cent in March to a staggering 25.8 per cent of our young people. That compares with 16.1 per cent a year ago. The jump is largely due to the fact that these young people have had to wait several months before they can access any support at all, but that is the figure. One quarter of our teenagers who want to work cannot get a job. Since the cutbacks I mentioned earlier in income support for young people-supported again, I stress, by the Opposition-we can safely assume that the vast majority of these young people who cannot find work are living in poverty. What an indictment of this Government! So much for caring for young people as one of our most precious assets. </PARA>
<PARA> As if that is not enough, the Government continues to make it harder and harder for young people who want to stay in education to access Austudy. In South Australia dozens and dozens, in fact hundreds of young people and older people are giving up altogether the idea of continuing with their education as they have longer and longer to wait before they can access any Austudy support. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like here to look specifically at what is happening in rural Australia. There are proportionally more low income families with children in rural Australia than in our cities. This was identified in several surveys, including one done in Victoria last year. To verify this we can look at recent statistics on the availability of the family allowance supplement (FAS), and in particular at those that show how many children in this country are able to benefit from the family allowance supplement payments. In South Australia, if we look at rural electorates, of which there are four, on average there are 4700 children in receipt of FAS. However, in city electorates in Adelaide, it is only half that figure, at around 2300. </PARA>
<PARA> The same story applies in Queensland: 5800-odd on average receiving FAS in rural Queensland compared with 2700-plus in urban areas. It goes on State to State-Victoria: rural, 4000-plus; urban, 1800 approximately. Over to Western Australia: rural, 4500-plus; urban, around 2400. So we see that poverty is a major and growing problem in rural Australia. These figures do not include most of the farm families because they cannot access the family allowance supplement because of the assets test that is placed upon it; they are simply not able to tap in. </PARA>
<PARA> With farmers not earning, and so not spending, rural small businesses are getting into deeper and deeper financial difficulties. Neither farmers nor in fact the small business people can access virtually any of the Department of Social Security benefits, and I want to spend a brief time on this now. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the rural adjustment scheme. This is very difficult, if not impossible, to access unless the farmer is prepared to leave the land. To add to the problem of lack of access, generally banks have to say that the property is unviable before help is given. It is almost impossible, I stress again, for farm families to access any Department of Social Security support. I here refer to the 1991 edition of The Rural Book put out by the office of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin)-and I commend the Government on its production. It highlights the benefits that could be available to farmers but, unfortunately, they simply cannot access them, largely due to the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> The special benefit is assets tested. Even though the farm maybe unsaleable and income negative, farm families get no help through this benefit. Unemployment benefit is assets tested, and farmers generally fail the work test as well because they are deemed to be underemployed and not unemployed. FAS, as I mentioned earlier, is unavailable. </PARA>
<PARA> Hardship provisions are virtually impossible to access-in fact I have found no farmer in South Australia who wishes to stay on his farm who has managed to obtain access through the hardship provisions. If the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), who has unfortunately left the chamber now, does know of any way that farming families can access Department of Social Security support at this time, I would be very happy for him to let this chamber know. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at just one area in South Australia-Kangaroo Island. Here, farmers are beginning to walk off their properties. Indeed, the majority of the farmers on the island are in financial difficulties. If they end up on unemployment benefits in Adelaide, the Government will have far more expenses-far more costs-than if they were able to stay on their farms. Not only will they need support benefits but they will also need accommodation support. So why not encourage the farmers by offering minimum income support to stay on the land?</PARA>
<PARA> The rural adjustment scheme must be extended to families staying on the land. As well, farm families must be able to tap into the social security support system available to other Australians. Work related assets should not be included in the assets test for income support or for education benefits. Only the income test should apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to an article in yesterday's Adelaide Advertiser. This supports what I have found as I have travelled through rural South Australia in the last few weeks. It is titled `Rural women hidden victims' by Zac Donovan. This research was put together by Miss Diana Laidlaw, the Opposition women's interests spokeswoman, and I commend her for this paper. She says:</PARA>
<PARA> Women are the forgotten victims of the crisis gripping South Australia's farming communities . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The research has shown widespread social and personal problems facing rural families and women. </PARA>
<PARA>Specifically, I will detail just a few of these problems, which are outlined in the article:</PARA>
<PARA> RURAL doctors are noting an increase in stress-related ailments . . . </PARA>
<PARA> DOMESTIC violence, caused by financial problems, is being hidden . . . </PARA>
<PARA> VICTIMS of domestic violence, caused by financial stress, are being forced back into violent relationships because women's shelters cannot cope . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And I also might add that many of these women are not entitled to any support benefit because they also fail the assets test-</PARA>
<PARA> FAMILIES are fragmenting as children leave home to find work because the family farm cannot support them. </PARA>
<PARA> VOLUNTARY community service work is suffering . . . </PARA>
<PARA> CHILDREN are suffering the effects of stress. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been reports of children bursting into tears at school. I wish to conclude by stressing that if we do not address these sorts of issues alongside the current obsession with pure money matters, we will not only be doing a disservice to the country generally but also perpetuating the injustices in future generations. I do not believe that is a legacy we should pass on to our children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The size and the nature of the crisis in unemployment were matters, interestingly enough, not dealt with effectively by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), largely because he refuses to admit them. Last year he assured me, in response to several questions at Question Time, that the bulk of the problem was over, that in fact youth unemployment, about which I was challenging his figures, was improving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, that is simply not so, and the latest figures dramatise that. The question, of course, of how to fix it is the key one. There is no point in this Minister spending the great bulk of his response in this debate dealing with what he claims are bits of policy documents-potential policy documents or policy options that may be discussed by the Opposition. It is no good his dealing with those as if that were somehow something to do with the problem that he has to fix. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that it does not matter how one fiddles with the social security system, how much one mucks around with welfare. If there are no jobs, one is going to have massive and worsening unemployment, and one gets no jobs when one mucks the economy around, as this Government has done, so that there is no economic capacity for jobs to exist. I suggest to the Minister that he would be far better employed trying to encourage his Government to follow our economic recipe for success-in fact he should have been doing that over the past eight years-rather than seeking to divert attention away from the problem that his Government has created. </PARA>
<PARA> I can remember his Government telling us some years ago that it was quite possible to conquer the twin problems of inflation and unemployment at the same time. The Fraser Government was castigated for having failed to do so. The Hawke Government would show how this magic thing could be done. It got away with it for a few years by putting this country incredibly in hock to the extent now that we are a massive debtor nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Our foreign debt is now five times what it was when the Hawke Government came in and bought its way out of an unemployment problem. But one cannot buy a way out of an unemployment problem if one is simply borrowing the money to do so. Now the borrowing has had to stop because we are going broke. Now we are seeing the real level of unemployment-the unemployment this Government can no longer hide. I should correct myself because it is still hiding a fair bit of it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are lots of fiddles with the statistics. If one is `employed' without pay for one hour a week, one is no longer listed by this Government as being unemployed. That is a terrific way to solve the unemployment problem-just cut out all those people who cannot get an employed job. For example, someone in a rural area might work on the family farm for no reward, yet is not unemployed, or someone might be working in the parents' corner shop. This is apart from the enormous fiddle involved in the statistics by the extension of Austudy to secondary schools which, as the Minister for Social Security said, in many instances may prove enormously beneficial in the long run to some people who would be given opportunities to get better education and training. But for many it is simply teenager-sitting at public expense in order to fiddle the employment statistics and to make them look far less than they really are. So the figures now hide a large volume of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see how bad these figures are. This is the fastest fall in the number of people in jobs and the fastest rise in unemployment effectively since the Depression. The rise of 230,700 over the past 12 months in people looking for jobs is a 57 per cent increase. That is an increase by more than half in the number of people looking for jobs in just 12 months. I might say that three-quarters of that increase is made up of males. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a comment from the Australian Democrats that the situation for females is equally bad, that they have simply been dropping out of the statistics-another bit of evidence of hidden unemployment. On top of this increase in the number of unemployed, the people looking for jobs, what has happened to the people actually in jobs? Over the last 12 months we have had a fall of 190,200 in the number of people in jobs. Of the number of jobs available to Australians almost 200,000 jobs have been wiped out by this Government in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that of those almost 200,000 jobs lost, 110,000 were people under 20. More than half the job losses that this nation has suffered in the last 12 months have come from the most vulnerable section of the Australian work force. They are the people aged between 15 and 19; the people who have just left school; who have just finished their training; who have very little job experience; and who are setting out on this, hopefully, adventure of life only to find immediately that it is a tragedy. They are in the firing line of this Government's recession we had to have. They are the people who are suffering most. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that, in recent statistics of voting trends at elections, the great bulk of young people have tended to vote Labor rather than for the coalition. I invite those young people whose jobs have been wiped out by this Government seriously to consider where their best interests really lie. Is it to continue to support the people who have destroyed their prospects of jobs and who have destroyed 110,000 of the jobs they actually had or is it to look to a political party which has an economic policy which will rescue this country-with great difficulty, I might say, but nonetheless rescue it-from the disasters brought about by the deliberate economy policy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating)? He proudly said that this was the recession we had to have and he keeps on saying that these are good numbers when we go further and further into debt. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no jobs for young Australians leaving school. We ask why and what can be done. As to why, the answer is that this Government has created on its own an economic disaster at a time when the rest of the world until very recently had been going through a continuous boom. On the question of what can be done to fix it, there is one simple answer and that is to change this Government, get rid of it. Then, unfortunately, the effort of correction is going to be long and difficult. But there is no doubt that while this Government persists with its dreadful and disastrous economic policies, we are going to have more and more of these disastrous figures. </PARA>
<PARA> There are now about six million people in full time work in Australia and that is the lowest for years. This full time employment situation is the real one. Many people are simply forced into part time employment because they cannot get a full time job. Even the part time employment numbers in the latest figures are down by around 30 per cent in the last 12 months; that is, something like 40,000 part time jobs have been wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment rate that this has generated of 9.5 per cent for people seeking full time work, and 9.2 per cent when one includes part time, is the highest level since 1984. This is despite the fact that probably something like 50,000 people who have been fiddled out of the unemployment statistics by this Government's devices. So, clearly, the real level of unemployment right now is far worse than it was at the worst point of the 1983 recession. I might remind the Senate that the worst unemployment figures from that recession were, of course, while Mr Hawke was Prime Minister and not while Mr Fraser was. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us concentrate on the people who concern me most as shadow Minister for youth affairs, and that is the young people of Australia. What we have had here in the last 12 months is the biggest job loss that has ever taken place in Australia, including 110,700 young people who have lost their jobs. So the number of jobs available and filled by people who are under 20 is now only 320,300. </PARA>
<PARA> I might remind the Senate that when Mr Fraser left office eight years ago to the very month-that is to the March figures-there were 438,000 young people at work in Australia. Under Mr Hawke there are now 320,300. The dramatic difference between the number of young people who could get a job under Mr Fraser compared to the disastrously low level under Mr Hawke dramatises what this Government has done for young people in Australia. It has lost something like 27 per cent of the jobs that were then available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Where have these young people who have lost their jobs gone? In the latest year there were 110,000 of them. According to these phoney statistics, youth employment has increased by only about 30,000 in the last 12 months. Yet 110,000 young Australians have lost their jobs. What has happened to the other 80,000 young people? One hundred and ten thousand young Australians have lost their jobs and yet unemployment is up by only 30,000. Where are the remaining 80,000? What has the Government done with them? Has it done a big fiddle? The facts are that the unemployment statistics do not reflect the number of young Australians who have been forced out of their jobs and, in many instances, into schools or into working for their families for no reward whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the unemployment rate of the young, according to the revealed statistics-at least the ones which we know are fiddled-we see that youth unemployment in Australia is up to a level of 25.8 per cent; one in every four young Australians is out of a job. Thank you, Mr Keating! This is a 10-point jump from the 15-odd per cent of March 1990-that is, a year ago. That is the biggest yearly jump on record. All we heard from Senator Richardson was a smart alec response to what he believed was a possible policy of the Opposition in respect of social security. These figures have meant a big increase in the number of people on unemployment benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table shows horrendous increases, particularly in Victoria, in the number of people who are receiving unemployment benefits.

Honourable senators will notice that New South Wales has about the best figure-only about a 32 per cent increase.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate we are having today on a matter of public importance emphasises to me the danger of trying to have an intelligent discussion about something as complex as national employment and unemployment figures only a matter of hours after those figures have been issued without allowing time for people who obviously have very genuine concerns about these issues to really see what the overall picture is or, more importantly, to identify the discrete elements of that particular picture. This was never so starkly pointed out as it was in the comments that have been made by the last two speakers about youth unemployment figures. It seems not to be appreciated that the overall unemployment figure-we are looking at it in seasonally adjusted terms-with regard to the number of people aged 15 to 19 years who are looking for full time work was 25.8 per cent in March of this year; up from 22.7 per cent in February. I am not denying for a moment that each case of unemployment may indicate a considerable amount of distress for the individuals and the families concerned, but one needs to remind oneself that that figure simply refers to the percentage of people in that age group who are in full time employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of that 25.8 per cent, only 8 per cent-or less than one-third-of 15- to 19-year-olds are actually looking for employment. The rest, who are not available for employment, are those who are in education or training. I would suggest that of the 110,000, according to the previous speaker, who lost their jobs-once again, we are discussing this matter without having a chance to really look at the position-many are involved in a labour market program of some sort or, as we know, have gone back into the education system to complete their matriculation, creating in the process some difficulties for some state school systems which are not quite prepared for the rush of young people. Let us get this into perspective: it is not one in four young people who are seeking full time employment; it is more like one in 12 young people. I think this adds a little light to that particular argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of public importance that we are dealing with today reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The worsening plight of the ever increasing number of victims of the Hawke Government's economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA>As is not uncommon in this chamber, that is a startling misrepresentation of the facts. There is no point in arguing that there is not an increasing number of unemployed people and, as I have said, in many cases it can be a tragedy. There is, however, a failure to acknowledge in this matter of public importance that, despite the increasing rate of unemployment-and I would much rather talk about rates than numbers-a significantly decreasing percentage of Australians face the poor prospect, in the longer term, of being unemployed; thanks to the education, labour market and social security policies of the Hawke Government. That is the truth of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> This applies to each discrete sector of the work force. It applies to women, especially those who have been out of the work force for any length of time and who are seeking to expand their skills and their employability. It applies to people with disabilities-there is a new disability program which is ready to start later this year-it applies to Aboriginals, where there is a slow but steady increase in higher education and work force participation. It applies particularly to youth, where the level of assistance that is available, the range of programs and projected programs, is better than it has ever been before. These are among the great achievements of this Government: the provision, as Senator Richardson said earlier, of a safety net which will cushion the effects of a recession such as the one from which we are suffering at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of elements to this safety net. The main ones would be income support, education and labour market programs. Income support for low income families and social security beneficiaries is enhanced a great deal on the position that existed when we came into government in 1983. In December 1990 our family allowance supplement (FAS) was being paid to 183,000 families, covering 454,000 children. By January 1991, it included 400,000 pensioners with their 740,000 children. </PARA>
<PARA> A very significant sector of the work force-I remind honourable senators that that is well over 1.2 million children out of a population of 17 1/2 million-is being assisted very substantially through this program. At the moment the payment, tax free, to eligible families for each child under the age of 13 is $26.50 per week and for each 13- to 15-year-old child it is $38.65. The average payment to families is in the vicinity of $65 per week tax free. That is the equivalent of a very substantial wage rise, as has been pointed out on a number of occasions by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The take-up of this program is satisfactory, although there could be some more understanding of the eligibility requirements. It has been found that the targeting of this particular program has been extremely satisfactory. The people who are receiving this assistance on account of their low incomes say that FAS plays a vital role in helping working families to make ends meet. It is used to pay for children's basic necessities such as clothing, food and school expenses, and the majority of parents receiving FAS think that their children are as well off as most children in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> It has had a significant effect on the level of net family income, which is not surprising at $65 tax free a week. Most families who are receiving a FAS payment rely on one income. They are heavily reppresentative of the families in Australia where there is only one income, and the families are shown to be ones which would much rather rely on that one income than on social security. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson has talked about the enormous difference that rent assistance has made. Since the child support scheme was introduced it has made an enormous difference to the standard of living of very many sole parents. The average level of court orders has increased substantially during the first stage by approximately 30 per cent a week, or $10. There are 36.5 per cent of custodial parents currently on social security payments receiving maintenance-compared with 25.6 per cent before the scheme, a very substantial increase in the number of people receiving the maintenance to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> The average amount being received by the sole parent pensioners with maintenance income from 1 October 1989 was approximately $70 as against $41.90 before 1 June 1988-a 40 per cent increase in that relatively short time. It is interesting to note that the incidence of non-custodial parents considered to be untraceable is very low-about one per cent-a very pleasant surprise for those of us who thought it would be much higher. </PARA>
<PARA> We have introduced labour market schemes that have been very well targeted and very successful for the particular groups at which they are directed. Job growth over the eight years of our Government has been very substantial. There has been a big loss of jobs in the last few months, but we must not forget that 1.6 million new jobs were created during those eight years, over 90 per cent of them being in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a much higher level of work force participation, providing for all those people who were in the work force-even if some have lost their jobs more recently-job experience and economic security during that time, and a much higher level of employability when the economy picks up. </PARA>
<PARA> Newstart was put in place in February 1989 and there was a 28 per cent drop in the number of long term unemployed between February 1989 and November 1990. Even at this stage the percentage of long term unemployed is far lower than it was in the early 1980s. We certainly hope that the labour market programs that are being put in place and that are being expanded will help to reduce the numbers of those who are long term unemployed at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The jobs, education and training program is another very well targeted program. Between March 1989 and May 1990 nearly 11,000 sole parents have participated in labour market programs. Until February 1991, 29,500 sole parents had actually attended interviews. Of course, child-care is a very important element of this program. The vast majority of those who sought child-care in order that they could go back to education and/or training or to employment has been accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these and other programs, real household disposable incomes per capita have grown by 12.4 per cent between March 1983 and September 1990. Although that is an average over the whole population, it should not be overlooked that this has added substantially to the capacity of low income families to withstand a period such as the one that is creating difficulties for many at the moment. The family package overall has helped increase the real income levels of the bottom 10 per cent of two parent families by 12 per cent and of sole parent families by 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder what it is that we might anticipate if there were a change of government. It is hard to tell. As Senator Richardson has described, all that we know about the plans of the Opposition that we have heard so far is somewhat fantastic and almost difficult to believe. When we look for hard evidence I suppose the best examples that we can find are those in the State of New South Wales, which has had a Liberal-National Party government for several years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted to Jenny Earle, Marion Brown and Linnel Secomb for their article entitled `Hard times for women under Greiner's NSW Inc.' in the Legal Service Bulletin in December 1990. They point out the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the conservative ideology and so-called economic rationalism of New South Wales Inc. is not conducive to an expansion of opportunities for women. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking today about `victims', and I think we have acknowledged the fact that unless women are able to develop their economic dependence, families on the whole will be much less well off. The State Government of New South Wales stood by while the Government Insurance Office abolished paid maternity leave for new employees and also abolished flexitime. The Government infrastructure in New South Wales for ensuring proper consideration of women's interests was dismantled, sidelined or otherwise silenced in the early days of the Greiner regime, presumably in the interests of efficient management. </PARA>
<PARA> Effectiveness and rationality seem to be the messages that are coming through, and certainly Senator Alston has not done anything to disabuse us of that impression. The article continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Other women's policy units were either eliminated or drastically reduced</PARA>
<PARA>It says that family support services were cut to the bone, many district offices of the Department of Family and Community Services were closed down, the Child Protection Council was greatly diminished and the capacity to respond to those community needs minimised. Finally, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be rather nice for women shareholders in New South Wales Inc. to feel that the next Board of Directors recognised their 52% shareholding!</PARA>
<PARA>I might add that it might be rather nice for the people of Australia to get the impression that there is some real concern for the needs of families by the coalition if, in fact, it is holding itself out as a credible successor to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish I could say it is a pleasure to participate in this debate on a matter of public importance today, but it is certainly no pleasure for me to debate the worsening plight of the ever increasing number of victims of the Hawke Government's economic management. Like my colleague Senator Michael Baume I would particularly like to concentrate on the young people of Australia. I was recently appointed to a young Australians task force set up by Dr Hewson and chaired very capably by Senator Michael Baume. Through that committee I have had the opportunity to visit and talk to young people and see what is happening out there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After all is said and done, it is the young people of our community to whom we are looking for the future. They are the ones who are going to make this country the `clever country', to quote the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Unfortunately, at this point in time, as has been pointed out by my colleague Senator Baume, from the youth unemployment figures today they must be looking with a great deal of scepticism to their futures. At that age the prospect of unemployment is totally degrading. Unfortunately, we are looking at the prospect of some young people spending their lives on the dole and hanging around waiting for the old age pension. What a future they must have. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot has been said today about youth unemployment and what is going to be done with the people who are unemployed. People have spoken about all these training schemes-putting young people into training and whatever for when we come out of the recession-but no-one has really said why we went into the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> We went into the recession because the policies of the Hawke-Keating Government-the policies of high interest rates, high taxation, high inflation and high exchange rates-have ripped the heart out of small business in Australia. Small businesses in Australia employ up to 80 per cent of our employable people. They are the ones who are feeling the effect of this recession, the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that no-one from the Government or the Australian Democrats spoke about small business at all, except for Senator Lees, who mentioned rural Australia, and I give her credit for that. When we look at what has happened because of the policies of the Hawke Government, we see that in Victoria from February 1990 to February 1991 there has been an increase in bankruptcies of 69 per cent. There has been an increase in bankruptcies in your own State of Queensland, Madam Acting Deputy President, of 50 per cent in the past 12 months. In Western Australia, Senator Cook's State, there has been an increase of 89 per cent, and in my own State there has been an increase of 10.4 per cent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the great State of Western Australia bankruptcies increased by 89 per cent from February 1990 to February 1991. The Australian Small Business Association has predicted that another one in eight businesses will go broke in the next 12 months. What has this Government done to help this situation? It announced in the Budget that small businesses would have to pay up to 85 per cent of their income tax by 28 July. That was a big help! That effectively brought forward the payment by nine months. I know that small businesses with profits under $400,000 are exempt in the first year, but that certainly was not any help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard a lot about interest rates and how they are coming down, but the rate that small business is paying is still around 16 to 18 per cent, plus all the additional charges that banks put on. The figure can then increase to around 20 per cent. The Government in its wisdom really helped small businesses by imposing a one per cent training levy-another great help! It might be fine in good times, but it certainly has been no help to them in this recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of comment from Senator Richardson and others today concerning what this side of politics would do about this situation. I think small business knows that one of the things the Opposition would be doing is giving some incentive back to small business by abolishing the capital gains tax. It is interesting to note that, when Arthur Anderson and Co. conducted a survey in September last year of over 2,500 small businesses, most companies reported a drop in profit and a confidence crisis in small business was evident. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to get young people-in fact, anybody-back into work, it is the small business sector of our community that we have to look at. If those opposite do not believe the figures I have quoted, they have only to go to places like Perth and Melbourne, or even my own State, and look at the number of shops that are closing up. When I mentioned bankruptcies, those figures did not take into account those people who have closed their doors because they could see what was going to happen to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees from the Democrats mentioned the rural crisis. We know that in good times the rural areas are big employers of young people, but at the present time, partly due to the high interest, high inflation policies of this Government, they are not only employing people, but their wives are looking for work and they are taking their children out of school, all due to this recession we had to have. I repeat: the effect of the recession on young people has been catastrophic. I quote from an article in the Age on 28 March written by Margaret Easterbrook:</PARA>
<PARA> Jobs, education and money are the personal issues of most concern to young people . . . </PARA>
<PARA> While people under the age of 25 are often generally worried about their finances, the rest of the community underestimate their concerns and consider unemployment, followed by drugs, as the main youth issues.</PARA>
<PARA>This poll was conducted by the Australian National Opinion Polls and it shows that, while many young people are interested in travel, employment is their primary interest and expectation in the near future. There is no question where the priorities of young people lie. These priorities are being denied them because of the economic mismanagement of the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the youth who are feeling the effects of the recession that we had to have. An article in the Australian on 15 February by its science and technology writer, Julian Cribb, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Jobs are becoming harder to find for university graduates, a national survey by the Graduate Careers Council revealed yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Of 84,000 graduates surveyed on leaving university last year, less than 60 per cent had found full-time employment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So our academics are also facing difficulties under this recession we had to have. An article in the Australian of 9 January stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Young people should consider staying at school rather than seeking work in the face of the recession, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a very apt cartoon in this article. It shows a young child saying, `Hawke says we should stay at school till after the recession!' The other young child is saying, `And then go straight on to the pension!' Mr Hawke advised school leavers to make full use of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> While unemployment would rise, training programs were ready to deal with the problem, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the point in training people if no small business is around to employ them? I will return to that subject a little later if I have time. What has been the effect of keeping people at school? I quote again from the Age, where the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, is reported as having said that:</PARA>
<PARA> High unemployment has caused overcrowding at universities across Australia . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The situation has reached the stage where students at New South Wales universities are being locked out of lecture theatres and are forced to take their courses in cafeterias. This situation is not going to improve, particularly while the policies of this Government are still in operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken about the prospects for the young unemployed and university graduates. What about the apprentices? As Senator Richardson said, small businesses would benefit through apprenticeship training schemes. The apprenticeship scheme is probably one of the most effective ways of training young people, yet in Victoria, we see from the Age, apprenticeship vacancies are down by 43 per cent. The Federal Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation, Mr Wayne Blair, said that the figures show that employers lack vision. What those employers lack is money and confidence. That is why they are not taking on apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has to start encouraging small businesses to get going again. They cannot do that while we have this high inflation, high tax, high unemployment situation. The figures that became available today have been commented on, but to reiterate: the unemployment beneficiaries in this country have risen in the past 12 months, from March 1990 to March 1991, by 204,000-from 392,000 to 596,000. In the same period, job vacancy figures have fallen by 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If we needed more evidence of the ever increasing victims of the Hawke Government's economic mismanagement, we need go no further than my own State of Tasmania. Senator Button, in answer to a question from Senator Harradine today, said that Tasmanian youth unemployment had always been high. I can guarantee that it has never been as high as 37 per cent on a State basis. In my own city of Hobart there is 40 per cent youth unemployment. I am not quoting the March figures; those are the February figures. So I cannot be accused of trying to fiddle the figures, as Senator Giles said in her speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button said that the figures had always been high and asked what the Government could do about it. The previous Premier of Tasmania and his Liberal Government tried to do something about it. They tried to establish a pulp mill, and yet they got rolled. They were rolled by the Greens with the help of the Commonwealth Government. Now we have Mr Field in a minority Labor Government trying to do the same thing and it looks as if he will also get rolled by Greens. One only has to hear what Senator Walsh said about the effect that the Greens are having on the economy of Australia. I wonder how they feel about the unemployment figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures that I quote from Tasmania are quite horrific. In the statistical region of Hobart the number of full time unemployed youth rose by a massive 85 per cent, or 1,100 people in the last 12 months. The youth unemployment rate for the same period has risen from 20.6 per cent last year to 40 per cent this year; in other words, it has doubled. There were 1,600 jobs lost, which translates to a 30.8 per cent fall in jobs that are available. The same figures show that in Hobart adults fared little better than young people. Total adult unemployment in Hobart is 42.6 per cent, which reflected a rise of 2,300 adults, and 1,700 full time jobs were lost during the same period. In the north of the State the figures are a little bit better, but the percentage rises have been just as dramatic. On a State-wide basis, youth unemployment has risen by 37.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The young people of Australia are suffering and suffering very badly. As we have said, in the main, it is all as a result of the irresponsibility of this Government and its economic policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join this debate on a matter of public importance introduced into this place by Senator Alston. The topic for discussion is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The worsening plight of the ever increasing number of victims of the Hawke Government's economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA>What we have heard from Opposition senators today is a very confused argument. They are not quite sure whether they are talking about what should be done under welfare to assist people or about economic considerations. Most of the time they have been trying to tell us that what this Government has done under welfare is a disgrace. That is quite curious. How can Opposition senators criticise us for not doing anything when they stand on policies that will do even less?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) pointed out that the Opposition has a policy whereby after nine months it would not assist people on unemployment benefits any more. They would either have to take jobs they did not want or they would get no benefits and have to manage for themselves. That was a quote from Dr Hewson and I am only paraphrasing it because I do not have it here. The best defence Senator Alston could mount against that was that it was not really reasonable to criticise the Opposition for this, that or the other piece of policy that it might or might not have. Honourable senators cannot come into this place, criticise the Government and not cop the same back if their policies do not shape up, judged by their own arguments or matters of public importance. Why should the Opposition criticise the Government, saying that it is not doing enough to help people under welfare when it has policies that will do much less?</PARA>
<PARA> At one stage Senator Alston reached dizzy heights of illogic by telling us that the number of women in the work force had gone from something like 28 per cent to more than 40 per cent. I am not at all sure what women in the work force has to do with a debate about unemployment, unless of course Senator Alston, like Senator Harradine, wants to suggest that there is a causal connection between women and young people-that women are taking the place of young people. Certainly Senator Harradine has mentioned that kind of argument quite often-that if only women got out of the work force and stayed at home where they have the preferred prospect of looking after their families, then there would not be anything like the same problems in work force participation for young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that Senator Harradine has never spoken to any woman in the work force and asked her whether she chose to get that job, whether she is pleased to get the income it returns to her or whether she finds herself more satisfied because she is able to go out and work. I certainly do not think that any of his Opposition colleagues have ever asked men whether many of them would prefer not to have to go to work each day. It demonstrates an insufficient understanding of what people do when they choose to go to work. As I said earlier, to actually suggest that the increased participation of women in the work force is some measurement of unemployment is an example of some dizzy heights of illogic reached by Senator Alston in his contribution, unless of course he means, as Senator Harradine does, that women in the work force are some kind of replacement for young people. By and large, if people understood female participation in the work force, they would know that women are doing jobs that do not replace other workers. Almost invariably they are taking jobs in the work force that are specifically for women and very rarely are they replacing either young men or older men. </PARA>
<PARA> As was spelt out, the Opposition wants to privatise many areas of welfare. I have a big concern about this because in telling us that some things will be privatised-for example, the assistance given to people who are in need of furniture; the household assistance that people in need receive; or the social work contribution from the work force-Opposition senators do not tell us who will pay for them. Does Senator Alston presume that unemployed people or very poor people will be able to afford to go to social workers under a private arrangement? Certainly no explanation was given as to how deserving people who have certain needs would actually benefit by having this sort of service being provided through the private sector. Somewhere along the line someone will have to pay. If it is a private provision of services, presumably it will be a user pays system; at least I think that would be consistent from Opposition senators. But nowhere do they explain how people who are poor could possibly then be able to afford those services currently provided through the public services of this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Opposition criticises the Government for not doing enough in the welfare area and says that we should do this, that and the other. But never does it say that it appreciates one of the most important values of good economic management-fiscal restraint. We see Opposition senators come in here and, by way of criticising us, simply allow us to conclude that they would increase outlays. If they do not mean that, they really must explain it. If they do mean that, then their policies would undo the enormous gains contributed to that section of the economy by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not appreciate that in the area of social security under this Government there has actually been a reduction in the outlays of that portfolio and, at the same time, an increase of each payment because these are more targeted and more stringent in their application. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees from the Australian Democrats wanted to make the point that the Liberal Party of Australia or the Opposition was just as culpable as the Government because the Opposition has supported the Government in a number of tough measures in the welfare area. I will not run through those again, but anyone who is interested might read Senator Lees's contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees cannot have it both ways. If she wants economic restraints, a good economic policy, and fiscal policy that is actually providing for that healthy country that we are looking for, she cannot continue to expend outlays under welfare. Does Senator Lees want to increase those payments to people who are eligible for welfare and at the same time increase expenditure or does she see what I have cited is the record of this Government-to reduce outlays and at the same time increase all payments-as a huge gain?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees also made a very important point that some people seem to be beaten down by the eligibility criteria whether they be the requirements of where they have to go, how many forms they have to fill in, or whatever. I think that point needs to be very thoroughly examined. Certainly, there are people who from time to time find that fronting those systems or services in this country is very forbidding and very frightening and all of us would agree there are people who are eligible for those payments who do not actually get them because they do not make it across the barrier. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a matter of grave concern to this Government and all the Ministers in the social security portfolio from Senator Grimes to Mr Howe to Senator Richardson have addressed how precisely to deal with that point. If people have eligibilities, they must not be prevented from getting them because of a hesitation, a nervousness or some barriers to their application. If Senator Lees knows of any examples and brings them to the attention of the Minister, he will very much want to address them. It has been his policy to make those eligibility criteria a critical part of the Government's policies. The Opposition has dismissed this out of hand this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Before this recession and before the undoubted needs of people who are currently unemployed-in a time of growing jobs and falling numbers of people depending on welfare-this Government was concerned to see that anybody on welfare did not anticipate a lifetime of being locked into welfare. This has been addressed by the provision of training programs, the assistance of payments, the recognition of poverty traps, the counselling services and the new subsets of welfare to special groups of people on pensions and benefits to assist them across that barrier from being on welfare to going back into the work force. Those programs are in place and will be assisting people with those needs now. I have not yet heard of any demand for those services being too high for the Department to supply. I am quite sure that that is a matter that the Minister has a close eye on and I am quite sure that, if there were that need, the Government would provide officers to assist those people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made another point. Senator Calvert seems to suggest that it is a dreadful thing to have overcrowded universities. Maybe there is not enough infrastructure in our universities. In saying that, Senator Calvert does not acknowledge the dramatic growth in university places under this Government. If that falls short-and I suspect it will continue to fall short for quite some time-let us talk about the shortfall and not suggest that it is some type of indictable offence to have people preferring to go to university than to go directly onto unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought it quite encouraging that so many people in this country would want to seek out those training opportunities and to get through university. Indeed, I think the most important point that needs to be put into this debate is that, despite the tragedy and the difficulty confronting people at the moment, because of the opportunities for training not only introduced now and being taken up now but also in place for a number of years, which are continuing to grow, particularly with the further announcements in the recent industry statement that more and more people are taking up that opportunity for training for skills development, as this recession recedes the Australian work force and people in Australia will be much better placed to take advantage of the opportunities that present when that recovery occurs. That point has not been spelt out by the Opposition. It seems not to be recognised by it. It is one of the reasons that makes this time in history so very different, even from that in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The book written by Mick Young during the Fraser years, I think, pointed out the terrible tragedy of losing so many trained and qualified people, particularly in the apprenticeship trades and crafts area, because there is at least a five-year lead time to get that skills base to where it can be used in a growing productive sector. That gap will not happen now. Because the Government has recognised the dreadful loss of skills disappearing in those years, it has particularly targeted programs to say to people, `If you have to be unemployed for a time, make constructive use of that time to get that training, to get your skills up so that as soon as the employment opportunities present themselves you, and on behalf of the community, this country, will be very well placed to move those skills into the work force where they are needed'. That point cannot be emphasised too often and too loudly. </PARA>
<PARA> As Minister Richardson said, this Government does not run away from the very sad consequences of the figure of higher than 9 per cent unemployment. Who would want it? Certainly not the Government. We recognise the pain and anguish that it is causing to so many people, particularly the personal deprivation of loss of job and loss of income. At the same time the Opposition does not acknowledge the commitment by this Government to those people, both in times when there were jobs and now, of not forgetting them or wasting them on the unemployment heap but of providing the counselling, the focusing, the training, the assistance, and even the educational programs for literacy and numeracy, recognising how many people in the Australian work force do not even have those basic skills. All those opportunities will be of benefit to those people in the short term and in the longer term and will, of course, be of benefit to this country. That increased educational base of Australia's work force will make this country that much stronger in the future and it will make it so much better able to face the recovery when it arrives. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years, we have been talking about the sad loss of skills in this country. That is one thing that will happen while this Government is in office and while it has its programs in place. From listening to the debate today, I only hope that, should the Opposition ever get into government, it would not insult Australian people by taking away those tremendous programs put in place by this Government to assist people at whatever time in life they find themselves able to benefit from training programs either during their working life, as they come into their working life or during a period of unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to Senator Crowley talk, one would think that Australia was not faced with an enormous tragedy. Blandly she spoke to the Senate. At no stage did she really tell the Senate what the Government will to do; what new policies the Government will enact so as to reverse this tragic trend in unemployment that we are seeing today. The Government owes it not only to the Parliament but also to the people of Australia and to the unemployed to tell us and them what new policies the Government will come up with and enact so as to relieve this tragedy. Instead, in the last few minutes, we have heard political point scoring and a false characterisation of a number of things that have been said by other honourable senators and by me. I will come to that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, let me remind the Senate of the enormity of the position which Australia and this Government faces: near record unemployment; a decrease in male and total seasonally adjusted employment, the largest monthly falls since the monthly surveys began in 1978; and youth unemployment at record levels. As my colleague Senator Calvert said, in the Hobart area 40 per cent of people are unemployed. What is the Government going to do about it?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley has attempted to falsely characterise what I have been saying about the participation rate and to falsely suggest that I have not been speaking to women in the paid work force. I happen to be the President of the Tasmanian branch of the largest union in Australia, a union which has a very large number of women members. What I have been saying is the policy of that union, determined at levels where women have been in the majority. Clearly, those women are concerned that they and/or their daughters at some stage will be in a one-income family situation. They know that this Government is discriminating against the one-income family. They know that the policies of this Government have forced families to have two and three incomes in order to make ends meet. A large number of those women are forced into the paid work force through economic necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 10 years, the number of families with at least one child under 4 years of age, both their parents being in the paid work force, has increased by 65 per cent. Why? A large number of them have entered the paid work force because of increased housing costs, inflation, higher taxes and reduced disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked the Government to look at the construction of the paid work force to see who in that paid work force desires to work to pursue socially constructed alternatives. They are not my words; they are the words of the Prime Minister. It was the Prime Minister who said that we cannot rely on economic measures alone and that we have to look at this other aspect to relieve the pressure. This was said in 1984, yet nothing has been done. No person should be compelled to leave the paid work force; neither should any family be forced by economic pressures, by government policies largely, to have both parents in the paid work force to the detriment of the family. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at family allowances. They have lost their value enormously. A family with three children is now $68 a week worse off than it was in 1976. Why not restore the true value of family allowances and extend child-care payments to all mothers, including those at home. Those changes are required to end the economic discrimination suffered by one-income families, and this could relieve the unemployment situation. </PARA>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH LEGISLATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE (HOSPITAL COSTS AND HEALTH INSURANCE)</PARA>
<PARA>May I first congratulate the Committee for its hard work in preparing a well balanced Report covering such a wide range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was appointed in June 1989 to inquire into and report upon the implications of clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which related to the introduction of the Government's Vocationally Registered General Practitioners arrangements. In addition to that task, the Committee was requested to inquire into and report on the Health Insurance Industry Structure. The Report we are addressing today relates to the latter Term of Reference. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that the Committee, which had all party representation, submitted a unanimous Report which endorsed Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been some recent debate on paying for health care instigated by members of the Opposition other than those on the Committee, which is once again proposing that Medicare be abolished. Will those members of the Opposition never learn. Three times the Government has gone to the people with Medicare as an integral part of its election platform and three times the people of Australia have endorsed the Program. The Opposition, which puts so much emphasis on results of surveys, should read the press releases put out by the Health Insurance Commission following its surveys of the acceptability of Medicare by the community-more than 71% of the population support Medicare. When is the Opposition going to accept that it is here to stay. </PARA>
<PARA>I make this point having regard to the introduction by the Committee that said ``This debate (in relation to Medicare and funding of public hospitals and the pressures on available resources) has, in the past two decades, all too often degenerated into a brawl between rival interest groups seeking to defend or promote their own views of, and positions within, the health system.'' (Para 1.4)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee continued with ``It is important that attention be focused on the real issues which affect health outcomes in this country and that the health debate be conducted in a well informed and non-partisan way.'' (Para 1.5)</PARA>
<PARA>It is within that context that the Government established the National Health Strategy-more commonly known as the Macklin Inquiry-to look at the real issues that affect the health of the population and the way in which services are financed and provided. </PARA>
<PARA>To that end, the Minister for Community Services and Health has referred the Committee's Report to the Macklin Inquiry and requested that the Inquiry take into account the Committee's recommendations in the course of its investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Select Committee broadly examined four aspects of the health care system:</PARA>
<PARA> - The Medical Context;</PARA>
<PARA> - Is Medicare Achieving Its Objectives?;</PARA>
<PARA> - Private Hospitals; and</PARA>
<PARA> - The Private Health Insurance Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend addressing in detail the Report or the recommendations contained therein. However, there are some significant issues which need to be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA>Reforms to the hospital system feature prominently in the Committee's Report. The Government has acknowledged on several occasions the need to closely examine existing mechanisms for hospital funding and where identifiable, shift the emphasis of that funding to address areas of need; for example, the stresses placed on the system because of the ageing of the population. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes the Committee's reference to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;RC) Working Party on Ethics and Resource Allocation and its desire to see a debate initiated on the ethics of resource allocation in hospitals. The Government would be happy to see such a debate and will refer this issue to NH&amp;RC. </PARA>
<PARA>On the more general issue of resource allocation, the Committee recommended that the NH&amp;RC be asked to develop goals for public hospitals and establish priorities for resource allocation. While welcoming input into the debate on health care outcomes, goals and objectives by an independent body such as the NH&amp;RC, the Government doubts that this is an appropriate body to do that task. The ultimate decisions about hospitals on, for example, location of hospital services, type and sophistication of services and number of beds, is a State Government responsibility. The Commonwealth has no direct role in the provision of hospital and related services, but provides funds to States to address areas of need. The determination of priorities is a matter for Ministers and it is in the Australian Health Ministers' Conference process that many of these issues are determined. </PARA>
<PARA>Two other recommendations made by the Committee related to changes to funding for hospital services. These related to the way in which Nursing Home Type Patients are charged and the possible introduction of casemix funding for hospital provision and services. Both of these issues are being looked at by the National Health Strategy. In addition, Cabinet has recently considered the role of casemix information and funding systems in improving efficiency and equity in the hospital system. As a result, discussions will be held shortly with State and Territory Health Authorities aimed at developing a co-operative approach to the uses of casemix information. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that the Committee rejected proposals for changes to be made to the Medicare Program. Some of the proposals were similar to those adopted by the Fraser Government which led to the abolition of Standard Medibank, namely, to allow individuals with private health insurance to opt out of Medicare, encouraged by increasing the Medicare levy and tax deductability of contributions. The Committee opposed these proposals because they would impact adversely on the principles of simplicity and equity of access, which are vital elements of the Government's Medicare program. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee made some interesting observations about possible reforms being made to the private health insurance arrangements. Many of the recommendations would have far reaching implications for the health insurance industry, the private hospital sector, and the community-in particular the suggestion that private health insurance might move to experience rating. Given the adverse impact on cash flows of private hospitals and the affordability of health insurance for the elderly and the chronically ill, the Government will need to be convinced that a move away from community rating is justified. There is, of course, within that principle the need to look at how reinsurance is operating. Nevertheless, these are matters which the Macklin Inquiry will no doubt be looking into closely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to this Government response to the report of the Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance entitled Hospital Costs and Health Insurance, and I believe a number of my colleagues may want to do that too. The response by the Government to the report has been incorporated in Hansard. I would like to highlight some of the points made by the Government in response to that Committee report, which the Committee called, `What Price Care'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges that it was a well balanced report, covering a wide range of issues. The Committee, as the response tells us, was appointed in June 1989 to inquire into and report upon the implications of clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, relating to vocational registration of general practitioners. In fact, that part of the reference was dealt with in 1989 and a report from the Committee was tabled in about August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to that, the Committee tackled the task of the second term of reference, going much more to health insurance and hospitals. I have commented before on the terms of reference. They were written in haste and promoted for political reasons; so they were less than tight and focused terms of reference. But the Committee was able to conclude that what we were really being asked to look at was Medicare, private hospitals, public hospitals and the efficiency of those three sections. </PARA>
<PARA> The response from the Government notes-and I think it is important to put it on the record-that it was an all-party committee. At the time of writing its report and concluding its deliberations, the Committee consisted of myself as Chairperson, Senator Peter Baume, Senator John Herron, who joined the Committee later with my colleagues Senator Michael Beahan and Senator Susan West, and Senator Coulter of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was widely representative. Indeed, it was thickly represented by the medical profession until Senator West-who is a very competent double or triple certificate sister, if I can use such old fashioned language to describe nursing-joined to assist us, at which time the Committee became representative of the health professions. I do not in any way denigrate her capacity or the information and expertise she brought to the Committee. It is important to note the construction of the Committee and also that that all-party representation submitted a unanimous report in part of its work endorsing Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 1 of the `What Price Care' report opens with a quote of the then Senator Puplick in a debate in this place talking to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. He described the Bill as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the next step to patch up this ramshackle, shambling and discredited health system of Medicare . . . in the face of all evidence that what [Medicare] in fact requires is radical surgery. </PARA>
<PARA>Our report did not find that, and the Government response to our report notes that, we did not focus on shooting our guns in the wrong direction but on trying to redirect the health debate so that it could be a constructive debate. The Government response picks up some of the comments from the Committee report. To quote again from the report, in part, it said:</PARA>
<PARA>This debate-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the debate about Medicare and funding of public hospitals and waiting lists-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . has, in the past two decades, all too often degenerated into a brawl between rival interest groups seeking to defend or promote their own views of, and positions within, the health system.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that attention be focused on the real issues which affect health outcomes in this country and that the health debate be conducted in a well informed and non-partisan way. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government response goes on to say that it is within that kind of context that the Government has established the national health strategy-more commonly known as the Macklin inquiry-to look at the way the real issues affect the health of the population and the way in which those services are financed and provided. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), in his response, has recommended that our report and its recommendations go to the Macklin inquiry, to be picked up by that inquiry and used as part of its deliberations, and indeed requests that the Macklin inquiry take into account the Committee's recommendations in the course of its investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government response says that the Senate Committee addressed the following: the medical context; is Medicare achieving its objectives?; private hospitals; and the private health insurance industry. It concluded that that would be very useful information for the Macklin inquiry in its deliberations. The Government response notes that reforms to the hospital system featured prominently in the Committee's report and states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has acknowledged on several occasions the need to closely examine existing mechanisms for hospital funding and where identifiable, shift the emphasis of that funding to address areas of need; for example, the stresses placed on the hospital system because of the ageing of the population. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government noted the Committee's reference to the National Health and Medical Research Council working party on ethics and resource allocation and its suggestion to see a public debate initiated by that NHMRC working party to look at resource allocation in hospitals. The response says that the Government will be happy to see such a debate and will refer this issue to the NHMRC. As the Chair of the Committee I am delighted that the Government is prepared to refer this issue to the NHMRC and encourage the NHMRC to look at ways it can establish that public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee realised that the pressures of increasing costs of health care in this country are not going to lessen; they are only going to continue. Not only is there increasing pressure as a result of people living longer-that is, the ageing of the Australian population-but also there is a significant push for increased expenditure for the ever-increasing high technology in medical care and delivery of surgical procedures and so on. Some of those high technology areas, which are very expensive, are in the investigative or diagnostic area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognised that increasing costs will only continue to apply pressure on governments when they already have another requirement, another pressure-that is, to keep the lid on the total outlay of health costs in this country. When there is a push for increased expenditure and a lid on how much can be expended, in the end we are going to have to look at agreeing that what is occurring now has to be discussed formally-that is, rationing the delivery of services. We have asked that the NHMRC go to the Australian public and say, `These are the sorts of challenges that we have to look at'. </PARA>
<PARA> While I can illustrate the point with all sorts of examples, from the wildly emotional to the much less than emotional, we must appreciate that if people have a fatal disease -I was going to say `are dying from a fatal disease', but I am sure Senator Watson would be amused at that contribution to the Rex Mossop prize; therefore I will not use that tautology-should they still be entitled to the surgical procedures that may be under pressure of supply? To what extent would a person with a fatal disease be eligible for much more than palliative care? That needs to be seriously addressed. It is a very hard question and we believe that it ought not be one that falls on the caring doctor or the practitioner nurse at the time. Also, it ought to be something that is beyond the hospital administration's decisions. It ought to be something on which the community has come to some agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> If it costs, as it does, $75,000 to keep an underweight baby, a tiny-weight baby, alive through the humidicrib and intensive care procedures, how do we put that cost against, for example, the general requirement of inoculation against measles? To what extent do we balance the cost of a liver transplant? Originally the cost was about $300,000. I understand that the cost has been reduced a little. One way of looking at it is to say that that one liver transplant to assist a very ill person is equivalent, we are advised, to the provision of 30 nurses for a year. Does the community have a view on such things? I believe it is time the community looked at these facts and had them presented to it in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> If we leave the health debate to be run by Derryn Hinch, I do not believe we will have a constructive outcome. It is no easy way to ask any individual patient or any individual patient's family to not want the best care for that person but, at the same time, we ought to be able to make decisions about what is a reasonable allocation of health resources. How do we decide between prevention and cure and, among those curative provisions, how do we make decisions? When my grandmother was alive she never even thought of having a hip replacement; it was not an accessible procedure. I suppose for many of the people who were alive not too many years ago-maybe 20 or 25 years-hip replacements were not a possibility. The technical know-how and their provision was not possible. When the operation was first introduced patients were a very expensive drain on hospital resources because of the number of days they were required to be in hospital. Nowadays the length of stay in hospital for such a procedure is remarkably short and patients are back on their feet in a very short time. That reduces the outlay of costs for such a provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Would anybody in the Senate say, `Certain groups of people are not going to have hip replacements', even though quite clearly they have severe arthritis, are in considerable pain, have disability with walking, and are getting back problems from the disability? Are we going to say that people are not to have a hip replacement? Somebody may have to make that decision. We believe that, to assist government or hospital administrators to make that decision, we should be putting the conflicting facts and values to the community and getting them extensively discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to ask people what their view is on the costs of health care. Do we see a push for the prevention side of health care that may assist people to keep out of hospital? At the same time, do we appreciate that the inoculation of children in this country has contributed to the demand on hospital services because so many more people survive? I am not suggesting that we go back to letting a large percentage of children die. I am suggesting that what we have to do is face up to the consequences of that kind of delivery of health care. That is what the report found-that there are many areas where some kind of rationing that is currently happening needs to be formally discussed and considered by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> One area that we heard about, although not in great detail, was the provision of a lithotryptor-that is, a machine that can reduce or do away with kidney or gallstones without any invasive surgery. Where should such an expensive piece of equipment be put and who should be eligible to use it? The Government, in dealing with this a few years ago, determined that such an expensive piece of equipment ought to be provided in a way that facilitated the optimal use by the maximum number of people. It may indeed be provided in the private sector, but it ought to be for the use of the public sector; or it may be provided through the public sector, but private patients should have access to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Herron might be able to say more about the state of play in Queensland in that and other high-tech areas. If he were able to contribute to the discussion along those lines, I for one would appreciate his updating it. He certainly made a very useful contribution to our deliberations about these matters and how government should deal with them. I hope that I have not anticipated Senator Herron's speech. </PARA>
<PARA> These things are currently happening. Indeed, the debate in this place in the past about waiting lists has sometimes been quite unseemly. The size of waiting lists has been used to thrash the Government. It would seem from some contributions that the only proper way to deliver health care in this country is to have a waiting list of nil. Any amount of evidence given to the Committee points to the fact that no hospital would have a waiting list of nil, meaning either no patients or no days to wait; that the majority of people who would visit their doctor and be judged as deserving of certain elective treatment are the people who are on waiting lists. A four- to six-week waiting list is seen as the optimal. By the time people put arrangements in place for their own businesses, their own family arrangements or whatever, no-one could just go straight into hospital. By definition, that is what waiting lists and elective surgery are about, and they are quite different from accident and emergency or urgency provisions through the health care service. </PARA>
<PARA> Waiting lists are a current, already-in-place method of rationing. One of the things that was of concern to the Committee was whether the extension of waiting lists in the public sector was disadvantaging public patients-that is, people who were insured under Medicare only. The very conclusive evidence before the Committee is that one cannot say. The data about waiting lists is very insufficient. The criteria from State to State was not comparable. First of all, the number of people on the waiting list was in doubt in terms of the accuracy of those figures and the criteria people had as to those who got onto the waiting list. The clear evidence was that there was duplication of waiting lists and, indeed, grave doubt about the reliability of the figures. </PARA>
<PARA> When I point out that the Committee received no absolute evidence about waiting lists, this does not mean that the Committee denied their existence. We know that waiting lists exist. What is in doubt and in considerable dispute is their size. The Committee concluded that a better way to look at this whole question was to take waiting times. The number of people on a waiting list could be very large, but if all those people were dealt with within six weeks nobody would have too much of an objection. But, in terms of numbers, one could say there was a very extensive waiting list. We recommend that a more useful way of looking at waiting lists for people who collect this data would be to look at waiting times. </PARA>
<PARA> We were advised that the public hospital system does a remarkable job in taking huge numbers of patients who come to it through accident and emergency-that is, as urgent matters for treatment-and that 100 per cent of people arriving in a hospital in the public hospital system, certainly in the two major States of Victoria and New South Wales, are dealt with within 24 hours. That is a remarkable achievement and an extraordinary acknowledgment of the ability to be effective in our public hospitals. I do not want to be understood as justifying having lengthy or growing waiting lists, but their size compared to the number of patients who go through the public hospital system is a small percentage. I could not reliably put a figure on the number in New South Wales, but it would be about one per cent-and that is perhaps an overstatement. The problem, as I said a moment ago, is not the actual number of people on that list but how long any one person on it waits. If one counts the numbers in the monthly statistics, one sees that many of those people are new numbers, but many have been there for the last three or four months. </PARA>
<PARA> We also found evidence, either from canvassing literature or asking people, that the waiting list problem is not new. It has been around for at least 20 years in more or less the same areas of specialty. That is a matter of concern. We suggested ways in which governments might like to consider addressing that matter-in particular, more movement between the public and private hospital provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Much could be said about this report. I think the Government's response to it suggests that we did provide very constructive information for the Macklin inquiry. I shall read very closely the papers that emerge from that inquiry. Already we are up to paper No. 4. I shall also look forward to seeing its recommendations to Government and how the comments in our report are taken into account by the Macklin inquiry. I believe that a few quotes from our report are already included in the most recently released paper. </PARA>
<PARA> We also in our report turned to private health insurance and suggested that there was room for considerable improvement in the private health insurance area. We discovered from senior surgeons that they could not advise their patients of how much it would cost because they could not read their way through the insurance forms either. I do not know how many honourable senators have recently looked at applications for private insurance, but one may have a gold star option or more modest bed assessments, and one can have extras or supplementaries. I find it somewhat challenging to work out the difference between an extra and a supplementary, but they have two very different meanings in terms of private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting through what the private health insurance people are advertising is one of the challenges. Evidence was given to us, as I say, by senior surgeons that they could not help their patients because there was such a maze to read through. We would like to see the health insurance industry picking up on that comment and our recommendations to that effect. It should try to simplify the system so as to make it easier for people to understand and therefore to exercise their option to take out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to see some serious deliberation and consideration about the whole private health insurance area. The wall around it from the rest of insurance means that it is a very comfortable area in some ways. Maybe it is time for the private health insurance area to take a long hard look at itself, and indeed for Government to look at it. For example, is it time to look at whole of life health cover that is included perhaps with superannuation, workers' compensation and so on? Could we be looking at a new way of providing health insurance that might make it an option that is more likely to be taken up, and perhaps even more likely to be less expensive?</PARA>
<PARA> We seriously looked at what has been used in the past, and that is the opting out of Medicare if one takes up private insurance. The Committee recommended strongly against this because of its dramatic capacity to cut into the efficacy and optimal outcome for Medicare. In particular, the Committee is concerned that the benefits of Medicare that have been now so well established are not diffused or lost. We do not want to go back to a sense of Medicare patients only being a stigmatised lot who cannot afford private health insurance or who are somehow less than virtuous in their health care provisions. Medicare has assisted through its universality and its cover of all in doing away with any of that kind of stigmatisation. We would certainly not want to see it return. We saw even on those grounds no good justification for the opting out provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Once one starts looking at the consequences of opting out-that is, the encouragement to take up private health insurance-one has to address the very serious question of what this will do to health costs. In general, it is an encouragement for them to increase because of the reduced restriction on what doctors will charge. It is within the category of privately insured people that we see a percentage of doctors who charge well above the schedule fee. They cannot do that for Medicare patients. So it is in the private health insurance area that this happens. We had anecdotal evidence about this. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator Walters</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they can charge above the schedule fee, and the Medicare patient pays the rest.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters might like to question that. I shall leave it to her to explain that to the Senate. Certainly we were concerned that if there was not that type of brake or check on those costs, that problem would arise. People took out private health insurance thinking that it would cover them, then they received a bill from the hospital and from their doctor that meant they were very much out of pocket. They thought they had bought private insurance to cover themselves but indeed, the very fact that they had private insurance put them more at risk in terms of an out-of-pocket expense. That was one of the reasons we were told, again only in anecdotal evidence, that people were not preferring to take out private health insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, representatives of the private health industry were unable to give us hard data on how many people might have left private health insurance for that reason. They were certainly concerned that there may be now almost a generation of people who had grown up without private health insurance, who had found their health needs were being met under Medicare provisions and who may never be persuaded ever to take it out again. Certainly, while the Committee appreciated the points raised by the private health insurance industry, we also recognised that we did not have the time or the direction under the terms of reference to fully and adequately canvass the area of private health insurance. So our recommendations went to highlighting areas that we thought could be usefully developed further. Indeed, in his response the Minister is suggesting that the Macklin inquiry take up those points and develop them further in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> The real question that emerges from this report is that in summary there are numbers of issues that are of concern. For example, one is that we have an excellent public and private health system but we have different ways in which those systems are funded. The public hospital system faces a real challenge to try to manage within its budgets. We had evidence of the ways in which the public hospital system increases its funding or reduces its outlays by shifting its costs to the Commonwealth. One small example was that patients who previously would have been sent home with four weeks' supply of pharmaceuticals are being sent home with two or one week's supply. The rest they then buy through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme system and that is then an outlay from the Commonwealth. The highlighting of the pressures for cost increases against the capping of budgets means that less than optimal practices are happening, and that these are exactly the sorts of things that the Macklin inquiry ought to address. </PARA>
<PARA> We were also interested to hear a number of complaints by the representatives of the private hospital system that there was insufficient bed usage in their hospitals. However, the evidence given to the Committee, and very well documented, shows that the story is actually otherwise-that there is very good use of private hospitals, even though there is a reduced number of people with private health insurance, and that is largely because the move to day surgery and shorter stays in hospital has meant a very much increased throughput of patients in the private hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to deal with what are described as efficiencies in the health care area, and these are ongoing challenges for those people who look at health economics. Essentially, an empty bed in a hospital is cheaper than an occupied bed, but that is not the sort of efficiency any of us who build hospitals or fund them would really be looking for.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite so. Senator Coulter reminds me that we were very entertained by being reminded of the Yes Minister program that addressed exactly this problem. A very efficiently run public hospital-according to the television program-was able to economise splendidly by making sure that a bed was never occupied. We do not believe that is a way to encourage practice in this country and I do not believe it is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also appreciated that more use of public and private bed arrangements between the two institutions would be a very constructive thing to do. That is exactly what is happening in the Illawarra district of New South Wales. The patients, especially those with eye problems, are being treated at private hospitals. That is actually contributing very much to reducing the waiting time for people with eye problems in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a very useful inquiry. The Government recognises that we have contributed to the body of information that can be part of the health debate. We hope that, in some ways, by suggesting that we start focusing on facts rather than promulgating preferred fictions, we might assist in helping the community appreciate the challenges ahead of it in the health area. </PARA>
<PARA> We need this debate about rationing resources. The community cannot do that until it has those facts and figures presented to it. I hope the National Health and Medical Research Council is very successful in conducting that debate, just as much as I look forward to the final recommendations of the Macklin inquiry and the way in which it can make use of our contribution to that inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I totally reject the third paragraph of this Government response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this is a unanimous report which endorsed Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>The Medicare system is in crisis; the Government has shown that by the establishment of the Macklin inquiry. The Select Committee addressed the problems associated with hospital costs and health insurance. If one asks people what Medicare is, one gets varied responses. Indeed, in the Select Committee's report it is defined thus:</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is primarily a system for the distribution of funding to implement the Government's commitment to providing access to public hospitals and reimbursement for all Australians of a proportion of their medical costs. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand the Macklin inquiry defines Medicare in its latest paper thus:</PARA>
<PARA>Medicare is a national public insurance program. So the Government cannot even agree with itself in two different reports as to the definition of Medicare. Therefore, it is absurd to say that the report gives a unanimous endorsement of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 the Medicare levy, which is 1.25 per cent of income brought in $2,545m, while the Federal Government expenditure was $7,497m. If the Medicare levy were to bring in this amount of money, it would need to be increased to an extra 5 or 6 per cent of income. One must bear in mind that Medicare does not include the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), nursing homes and hostels and the Department of Veterans Affairs and its repatriation hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> The Macklin paper No. 4 has a quote that the public believes that Medicare pays for public hospitals and 85 per cent of doctors' bills and that one in five is unsure or incorrectly believes that private hospital care is covered under Medicare. So the public itself is confused about Medicare, let alone the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). Page 2 of this report refers to the static proportion of gross domestic product consumed by health services, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> This makes explicit what has always been an issue in health care provision-the rationing of resources and the ethical problems associated with this. Because they are policy and ethical questions the community should be involved in addressing them. It follows that they must be resolved in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA>Since this report was written, the New South Wales Government has produced a booklet, Health Care at Any Cost, to stimulate debate in this area. There are major problems in health care in this country at the moment, otherwise this Committee would not have addressed them, nor would the Macklin inquiry be addressing them. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the use and cost of technology, which is dramatically increasing at the moment. The use of pathology and radiology has increased 42 per cent per patient in the last five years. The medical service use per person has gone up 23 per cent in the last five years. Health insurance rates have increased by 72 per cent in the last three years, and have risen by 100 per cent in the last five years. The use and cost of pharmaceuticals has dramatically increased. The Government has made some attempt, by introducing co-payment, to rein in this cost but in 1990 it cost $1,500m and in 1982, $658m. There has been a dramatic increase in the population and the number of aged persons. We must bear in mind that two-thirds of health expenditure occurs on people over the age of 60 years. The population, which is now 17 million, has 2.6m over the age 60 years-15.5 per cent of the population. A little over five years ago it was 15.6 million and 2.3 million over 60 years of age. So not only is the population increasing but it is also rapidly ageing. Waiting lists have been referred to. The Australian Private Hospitals Association Ltd believes that at any one time there are 75,000 people waiting for admission to public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Something that is not addressed in the report is the dramatic increase in the number of doctors in the community. It is estimated that there are over 38,000 doctors now in practice whereas 10 years ago in 1980 there were 25,700. The report by Sir William Keys on behalf of the National Office for Overseas Skills Recognition has been previously referred to. This year, 800 overseas doctors will be sitting for examinations so that they can be registered in this country to add to the burgeoning number of doctors who are coming into the community. The medical schools themselves already graduate 1,200 Australian students. The possibility arises of this dramatic increase being furthered by the National Office for Overseas Skills Recognition and, indeed, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. There has to be some resolution of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other problems including the mal-distribution of health personnel where only 23 per cent of doctors are outside the cities; the gap between medical fees and Medicare refund which has been increasing; the increasing demand for nursing home beds; and the dramatic increase in pensioner health card holders, benefit card holders, sickness benefit card holders, and their dependants, which now totals 3.8 million of the population of 17 million. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also problems with the demand for screening in relation to mammography, acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other diseases. Costs in the public hospital sector are increasing 12 per cent per year. There has been cost shifting between the State and Federal governments particularly in relation to pharmaceuticals, which has already been referred to by Senator Crowley. Also of concern is the shifting of outpatients out of the hospitals into the private sector and the billing of privately insured public hospital patients. The Minister says that the Committee gives a unanimous report which endorsed Medicare. It is an unbelievable conclusion. The level of private insurance is now down to 43.1 per cent, whereas it was nearly 70 per cent only eight years ago, and capital investment in the public hospital system is now down to 3 per cent of recurrent costs. </PARA>
<PARA> This is supposedly a report which endorses Medicare. Page 6 of the report refers to the introduction of case mix base charges. Since the report was written I attended the inaugural national conference of the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals on Monday this week, 8 April. A paper was presented by Johannes U. Stoelwinder, who is chief executive officer of the Monash Medical Centre in Melbourne. He referred to an earlier paper entitled Dear Minister, Please Save Me From Case-Mix Funding, which was an open letter addressed to the Minister for Community Services and Health and which was published in the Australian Health Review last year. Stoelwinder states in this paper:</PARA>
<PARA> The model for case-mix funding is Medicare in the USA where it was implemented to contain the growth of costs. Australia does not have a problem with growth of cost. Our total spending on health care has hovered in the 7.6 to 7.8 per cent of GDP for over ten years. Hospital costs have been at 3 per cent of GDP over that time. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The economic argument about efficiency is essentially a theoretical one. Australian hospitals have, in fact, improved their efficiency as demonstrated by growing throughput with less beds by shortened length of stay. The economic argument goes that competition creates efficiency, our current funding of hospitals does not create competition between public hospitals and between public and private hospitals. Therefore, by moving to case-mix funding we will have competition and, ergo, efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> While one can never argue that efficiency could not be improved (significantly, in my view), the lack-of-efficiency argument needs to be put to justify such radical funding reform. However, it would not be the first time that significant reform in the administration of the health system was based on a lack of credible need.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if it is not broken, why fix it? Page 41 of the Committee's report reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact there is no evidence that Medicare has encouraged overuse of either medical or in hospital services. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the report was published, the Department of Community Services and Health has published figures from the Medicare claims data file that show a rapidly increasing average use of medical services per person by State. In my own State it has increased by 23 per cent in the last five years and there has been an increase of 42 per cent per patient in the use of pathology and radiology. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 78 of the report in fact promotes private insurance and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The public sector has a vested interest in maintaining an active private sector, both to provide choice for some services to the community and to attract resources . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe this should be emphasised. Here we have the Minister saying that it is a unanimous report which endorsed Medicare. On page 101, the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee therefore recommends that the Macklin inquiry establish a working party to examine the likely impact of reforming private medical and hospital insurance. The findings of the working party should be presented with the final report of the Macklin inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>However, since that was written, again I have serious reservations about the impartiality and objectivity of the Macklin inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been brought to my attention that not only does the Committee have no practising doctor on it, but also its chairman is not an economist, neither does she have any medical or nursing expertise. She has been a researcher and journal editor at the Labor Resource Centre in Melbourne. This centre was opened by Mr Gough Whitlam in 1976 as a `research organisation supporting the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement'. The present Federal Minister for Health has been Chairman of the Centre's board of directors. </PARA>
<PARA> Ms Macklin presented a paper discussing the work of the Labor Resource Centre at the Marx centenary conference in 1985. In this paper she stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the time I have been thinking about strategies for the 80's challenging capitalism and building socialism. </PARA>
<PARA>Further she stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The essence of this is that it is a strategy for a war of position where we can gradually make incisive interventions into the sovereignty of capital. </PARA>
<PARA>Hardly a recommendation for conducting an impartial inquiry into the health insurance, health system and health strategy of this country. I no longer regard Ms Macklin as impartial and objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has stated that the Committee rejected proposals for changes to be made to the Medicare program. That is not correct. The Committee supported the principles of universality and simplicity but stated quite clearly on page 52:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth seek to extend use of private hospitals by the public sector where it is a cost-effective way of providing treatment, particularly in specialist areas which are characterised by significant delays in providing elective treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on page 78, the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The public sector has a vested interest in maintaining an active private hospital sector, both to provide choice for some services to the community and to attract resources into the health sector. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister needs any further evidence of the impending collapse of Medicare, I refer him to yesterday's Courier-Mail under the heading `Equipment loss may close clinic'. This article refers to the Royal Brisbane Hospital, the major and largest hospital in Queensland, where financial restrictions have left it with only two functional bronchoscopes, with operating theatres that are being closed and with lists being cancelled. My understanding is that the hospital has already exceeded its budget to the end of June and is now running in deficit. It is obvious that Medicare in its present form cannot sustain Australia's health system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on I am not too sure what because, for the first time while I have been in the Senate, we have a Government response to a report before we are actually technically debating the report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance entitled Hospital Costs and Health Insurance and they are both on the same Notice Paper. But I notice that the previous speaker, Senator Herron, addressed both and Senator Crowley seemed to confine her remarks fairly much to the actual report rather than the Government's response to the report. Having said that and remarked on the peculiarity of the situation, I just wish to make some remarks on both the report and the Government's response to the report.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. In his remarks, the previous speaker picked up on paragraph 3 of the Government's response, in which the Government is noting that the Committee had all-party representation and had submitted a unanimous report which endorsed Medicare. It seems to me that that is drawing somewhat of a longbow because, quite clearly, while endorsing the fact that a national health care scheme along Medicare lines needed to be retained-and it is something that I think everybody on that Committee did endorse strongly-the report, nonetheless, made recommendations for modifications, both in the public and the private area. So I think what is endorsed is the need for the underpinning of a health insurance scheme by a scheme which is very similar to Medicare, perhaps with some modifications. I would like to address some of those modifications in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things to which our report drew attention, and something which I have mentioned in this chamber on a number of previous occasions, is that there is a desperate need in the Australian community-indeed throughout the developed world-to encourage public debate on the emergence of new technologies, particularly expensive technologies, and the role which they should play in the treatment of patients. Both previous speakers have instanced examples of some of these very expensive technologies, their costs and what can be achieved with them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite unsatisfactory that the application, or non-application, of these technologies should be left in the hands of doctors or medical personnel in hospitals: for example, decisions about patients getting kidney transplants or heart replacements or lithotrity, which is mentioned, or some of the more expensive imaging technologies should be made under a cap of economic constraint and they should be made by medical personnel under that cap. It is quite clear to me, and it has been for a long time, that we need a wide-ranging public debate as to just what sorts of services should be provided. If there is to be a limitation on those services, that decision should be made by the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in responding to that matter the Government draws attention to that fact and then says that the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) ethics and resource committee allocation will be looking at that. It mentions its desire to see a debate initiated on the ethics of resource allocation in hospitals. It says that the Government would be happy to see such a debate and will refer this issue to the NHMRC. It has made a partially positive response to that recommendation because, quite clearly, what is needed here is an ongoing debate. We are not at the end of the process of introducing new expensive technology; this process will continue. As these technologies emerge, we need to continue that public debate as to the application of those technologies, and the debate needs to range far more widely than just in the medical area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a case, as Senator Crowley mentioned, of whether we immunise 1,000 children against diphtheria compared with a very premature baby-I think that was her example-with little chance of survival whose care is associated with enormous costs. We need to consider the costs of medical care in the community against a whole range of other community needs. Is it more appropriate to provide more adequate pensions for elderly people so that they can live with a greater level of dignity or to provide better kindergartens for children rather than some of these increasingly expensive medical treatments? I do not choose to answer those questions for the very real reason that these are questions which really need to be opened up for public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is true, as both previous speakers have said, that we have, quite remarkably, kept medical costs in this country to somewhat less than 8 per cent of gross domestic product for more than a decade, nonetheless, that cap is being administered by medical personnel under increasingly difficult circumstances. Doctors are being asked to make ethical decisions which should really be made in some wider context. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the Government has responded to this particular recommendation in a way which is far too narrow. We do need a debate, but we need an ongoing debate. It needs to be a very wide debate, not just within the medical area, and one which makes comparisons more widely with other social services provided by government. Of course, that debate might show-and here again insufficient figures are available on this-that some of the preventative medicine measures which have been implemented in recent years, such as health and education measures aimed at reducing smoking or health and education measures aimed at improving diet and exercise which have probably led to the significant reduction in coronary heart disease, may be a great deal more effective in dealing with these conditions than allowing people to develop diseases as a consequence of faulty lifestyles and then trying to pick up the pieces afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not know that at the moment. The results of such inquiry and debate may well come out with the opposite conclusion. Again, the results will emerge only if we spend more money in the area of health research. Even in the area of health education we do not really know what means of health education are more effective than other means: for example, whether certain types of advertising campaigns to encourage people to stop smoking are more effective than others or whether it is better to aim them at young people at this age or that age. A great deal more research needs to be done in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the Government has rejected the NHMRC as a review body in relation to goals for public hospitals and public funding for health. If I recall correctly, the Committee made that recommendation because it cast around for a suitable body that was already in existence rather than face the task of creating yet another body. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the point I made at the beginning: that the Committee quite clearly recognised the Government's acceptance, and the desirability, of having both a public and private health insurance program in this country. I will speak to that point for a moment. There is a strong tendency, in both government and opposition, to say that the market system will provide best for Australian society in a general sense; there is a tendency to leave everything to the market. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a clear cross-party recognition by this Committee that in the health area-and my own view would extend it to many other areas-the market system simply cannot provide adequately. The market system will make allocations which are inequitable. Left to itself, the market system would provide the second Rolls Royce for the rich before it provided the mere basics of medical care for the poor. It is in that context that a continuation of a publicly-funded-tax-funded-Medicare system is absolutely essential. In this context, it is distressing to note that where the Committee has recommended that it may be appropriate for the private health insurance system to go away, either entirely or partially, from community rating towards a risk-rating system-in other words, towards a more purely market-driven system-the Government rejects this totally. </PARA>
<PARA> In that response from the Government I see a very dangerous philosophy emerging, and that is that the Government also sees private health insurance as a necessary underpinning of an inadequate-and I stress, inadequate-Medicare scheme. If the Medicare scheme was adequate to provide the underpinnings, then it would not be necessary to impose the very complex community rating system which is imposed on private health insurance. If the Government really wants to get out of this confusion, it seems to me that it would provide a more adequately funded Medicare scheme and, at the same time, perhaps, allow the market system to operate more freely within the private health insurance area. The fact that it is not prepared to do that I read as a rather sinister sign of the continuation of inadequate funding of the public health care system. </PARA>
<PARA> Our report draws attention to the ageing of the Australian population. Previous senators' remarks also included reference to that increase in the age of the Australian population, the heavy dependence of some part of the aged population on health care and the high cost of that. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that while there is an increase in the age of the Australian population, two other factors bear very strongly on the costs of providing social welfare services in the health and other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> They are that the Australian population has fewer young people in it, and the overall total costs of providing education, therefore, may well be falling. The way that we might pick up the increased costs of supporting the elderly may be through a shift of resources. Secondly, as a consequence of the decrease in the number of young people in the Australian population, and even taking into account the ageing of the population, the number of working people in the community relative to the number of people who are supported-in other words, the dependency ratio in Australia, to use a demographic term-is better now than at any time since the Second World War and will continue to be like that for the next 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to be careful when we wave the flag of ageing population and say, `Whoa, whoa, whoa. We need to spend a lot more money in this area'. We need to recall that there are other demographic shifts in the Australian population which, if properly addressed, might well allow us to shift those resources to the areas where they are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> In that connection our Committee recommended that if the current reinsurance scheme, which is part of the community rating scheme, is to be retained, then all over 65s should not be classified as a high risk group for reinsurance purposes. We are all aware that there are many people in the community over the age of 65 who are perfectly healthy and who remain healthy for many years, and within that group it is a much smaller group which is heavily dependent, particularly in the last stages of life, on the health care scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point that I would like to pick up is the decrease in the number of people who have taken out private health insurance in recent years. Attention was drawn to that and it was made a feature of the evidence before the Committee. The Committee received some evidence, quite strongly put, that what was necessary was for the Government, essentially, to underwrite the private health insurance system so as to encourage more people to take out private health insurance. The evidence which we received on this point was controversial and conflicting and, in general, the Committee came to the view that if more money was to be put in, rather than underwrite private health insurance it would be better to more adequately fund the Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA> If private insurance is steered towards a risk rating system it is quite clear that there will be some people who will be encouraged to go into private health insurance who now no longer take out private health insurance. The young and the healthy may well enter private insurance schemes because, for them, the costs would be much lower than at present where their health insurance premiums underwrite some of the risk being picked up by the elderly or people with chronic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, there will be other people who would leave private health insurance because, under a risk rating scheme, the premiums would rise. As I recall the evidence before the Committee, it was that probably the numbers in private health insurance would fall still further to somewhere around 20 per cent. I seem to recall that that was the evidence before the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. That may be the system towards which we are moving. Perhaps we should move towards a system based on the philosophy, which is strongly espoused by the Government and the Opposition, that we continue to have a private health insurance system, but a private health insurance system which is based on risk rating, in other words, a free market type system. If we are to go down that road-and I return to the point that I made earlier-then the existing underpinning of that scheme through a publicly funded, tax based, Medicare type system must be far more adequately supported than it is at the present time. It is quite clear, as we move into these more expensive modes of treatment-and if we are going to apply those to the Australian community-that it is quite unconscionable that the rich will have access to those facilities and the poor will simply not have them available at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was absolutely staggered and amazed at the Government's response to the report of the Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. For the Government to claim that the Committee, which had an all party representation, submitted a unanimous report which endorsed Medicare was just not factual. It is a pity that the Government has resorted to that sort of falsehood to try to get some political advantage. How can a committee unanimously endorse Medicare when it puts forward six or seven recommendations-I have not counted them all-asking for change? That is not endorsing Medicare. It seems to me that there are so many flaws in what the Government has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government also said in its reply-again, far from the truth-that the Health Insurance Commission, following its survey of the acceptability of Medicare by the community, found that more than 71 per cent of the population supports Medicare. He asked, very sarcastically, `When is the Opposition going to accept that it is here to stay?'. </PARA>
<PARA> If we have a look at the Health Insurance Commission survey, we come up with some very different figures. It says, quite rightly, that 71 per cent of people were in favour of Medicare, but-as with the findings of the Committee-51 per cent of those surveyed said that they wanted a change to Medicare, 45 per cent said that they wanted it kept as it is and 4 per cent were unsure. The change people wanted varied considerably from some minor change to an emphasis on making membership of Medicare voluntary. I am reading from the Health Insurance Commission report. What absolute rubbish and indeed misrepresentation the Government has put forward in its answer to the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference the Committee were to look at were the effectiveness of the current health insurance industry structure, in particular, the ability of hospital Medicare to meet its two main objectives, namely, accessibility and equity and the type of restructuring which may be necessary to assist in this regard. I wonder why the terms of reference only mentioned those two objectives? The Department does not agree with that. Indeed, it says that Medicare's objectives have been concisely summarised as universality, simplicity, equity, accessibility and cost containment. I am reading from the report. That is what the Government's Department believed the objectives were. Cost containment is very important to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of Medicare says that it is really just a place where money is handed out, first to the States and secondly to the private patients. In looking at the issues of universality and simpli- city, I agree that Medicare has been successful in those regards. Everyone is covered by Medicare and although not fair it is simple. But let us come to equity. It is pretty important that we look at equity and accessibility, and cost containment, because to my mind those are the most important objectives as seen by the people of Australia. Even the Committee admits that equity was compromised. And boy, how it is compromised!</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to read into Hansard a letter that was given to the Committee in evidence. It is a letter sent by the Medical Director of Williamstown Hospital to the Executive Director, the Director of Nursing and the Admissions Clerk. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The financial position of the Hospital has deteriorated throughout the month of January and the over-run is now in the order of $385,000.00. This amount has to be recovered before the end of the financial year. In particular VMO-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, visiting medical officer-</PARA>
<PARA>payments are presently $92,000.00 over budget with pathology and radiology payments also over budget. These over-runs reflect a public/private mix of 66.2% public patients year to date-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, 66.2 per cent public patients to date this year-</PARA>
<PARA>an over-run of 6.2%. It is therefore necessary to adjust the number of public patients admitted for the balance of the financial year to the level budgeted for. </PARA>
<PARA> In consequence all future elective bookings of public patients will be on the basis that any number in excess of one public patient per elective list will require approval from the Medical Director. This restriction will not be introduced for patients for whom request for admission has been received as of today the 23rd February, 1988 but will be active for all requests for admission received after today. The restriction will remain in place until future notice. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that because this public hospital had an overrun and because, according to its budget, it had too many public patients, too many Medicare patients, being treated-66.2 per cent-it said that there would be no more public patients on elective surgery lists, except one on each list, until private patients were brought into the hospital to fill those elective lists. That is an extraordinary situation. My impression was that the public hospitals were there to serve Medicare patients primarily. But this public hospital in Victoria was told, and I would like to emphasise it:</PARA>
<PARA>In . . . future elective bookings of public patients will be on the basis that any number in excess of one public patient per elective list will require approval from the Medical Director. </PARA>
<PARA>What an extraordinary situation. Yet the Minister says that Medicare is effective and that Medicare has been `endorsed' by the Committee. The Committee was given that sort of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> We now know that 41 per cent of people over 60 years of age are privately insured. That is 41 per cent of the majority of pensioners. About 700,000 pensioners are spending a large proportion of their pension on health insurance because Medicare cannot service their requirements. But 20.6 per cent of those privately insured have weekly incomes of $160 per week. What do people have to go without to pay private health insurance when they are getting only $160 per week? As to single parents with dependent children, 21.5 per cent of those privately insured have private health insurance. These people are struggling to make their priority health insurance because Medicare is not satisfying their requirements. As the Health Insurance Commission survey says, 51 per cent of people want changes made to Medicare. I have taken those percentages out of the latest Macklin background paper No. 4. So we have a situation where true equity and access-one of the prime objectives-does not exist in Medicare at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian public hospitals admit to an average waiting list of 20,400. Senator Crowley said that the waiting list figures were inaccurate and that there had to be waiting lists; she went on with all sorts of excuses. But when we see a letter written by the medical director to the admissions clerk of one of the public hospitals in Victoria, we certainly understand why those waiting lists are so high. Public patients are to be debarred from the hospitals because the hospitals have had an overrun in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 2 of the report asks, `Is Medicare achieving its objectives?', but it does not answer the question. I was very surprised, knowing former Senator, now Professor Peter Baume as I do, that he did not insist on some aims and objectives. The requirement for the National Health and Medical Research Council to take up that recommendation to go into the aims and objectives was made because none were able to be put forward by the Department. Of course the Government is right in its response. The National Health and Medical Research Council cannot do it for the Federal Government because it is a State issue. That is one area where I believe the Government was correct in saying that it could not really give that task to the National Health and Medical Research Council to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing again with waiting lists, I point out that the Australian Private Hospitals Association compiles a considerable number of statistics in this area. It says that about 75,000 Australians at any one time are waiting to be admitted to public hospitals. If Victoria has about 20,400, that figure of 75,000 is not a figure that anyone could dispute. I know that in my State at the moment in orthopaedics the waiting time for a hip replacement is about 85 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to the other objective after equity and access, which is cost containment. Yes, cost containment has taken place because services have been rationed. From the report we see that over the five years between 1982-83 and 1987-88, 800,000 bed days have been cut from the public hospital system. That is some rationing and that is some way of putting a cap on the costs! But is it an equitable way? I certainly do not believe that it can be said that it would be particularly equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go through the recommendations. The one that interests me and the one that I would agree with most is the recommendation that the National Health and Medical Research Council be asked to establish priorities for resource allocation decisions by the Government. Containing the costs of new technology in the health field is something we have spoken about for a number of years. Who makes a decision on who gets what medical service? Who is entitled to some of the most expensive medical costs when it comes to people with varying health problems?</PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that the National Health and Medical Research Council is as good a body as any to give the decision to. It cannot be given to the doctor treating the patient; every doctor wants to do the best for his or her particular patient. It cannot be given to the nurses; every nurse wants to do the best for her particular patient. Nor can it be given to the matron of the hospital. All are too heavily involved with both the patient and the patient's relatives to be able to say who gets the best health care in this country. What the Government is saying is that we must have a cap on the costs. If people are not prepared to pay more taxes for our health care, the Government has to ration health care. Senator Crowley spoke about that issue today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has come up with the recommendation that this very difficult task be given to the National Health and Medical Research Council. I wish it the best of luck because I really think that that is perhaps the most difficult job that anybody could be asked to do. The mother of a four-pound baby would quite rightly want all the best health care and new technology, et cetera, for the care of that baby in order to give it a healthy life. I think that it would be very difficult for someone to tell that mother, `No, I am not going to allow that to occur. Your baby isn't worth saving.'. If the National Health and Medical Research Council can come up with something along those lines, I wish it luck. As I say, the other recommendation seeking the Council's assistance to define goals for public hospitals is a State matter and I do not see how it could be expected to come up with that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards standards and aims I point out that at the moment 143 private hospitals have accreditation, which is 42 per cent. Only 23 per cent of public hospitals are accredited. Of course the standards for accreditation are the same for both public and private hospitals. So it is really up to the public hospitals to get their act together and have accreditation-to make sure that they come up to scratch with their standards. If they do not, the State or Federal Government has to supply the answer because patients will be requiring the standards to improve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's next recommendation says that, where a case mix system for costing hospital services is introduced, private patients in public hospitals should be charged the full case mix base cost of their treatment to reduce the disparity between fees in public and private hospitals for private patients. I do not understand the justification for that. If as a privately insured patient I go into a public hospital, I have already paid my levy. Therefore, my costs should be taken into consideration in that public hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that I am privately insured but am using that part of my payment of the medicare levy means that I should get public hospital treatment free. A privately insured patient pays the levy, pays a private contribution to the fund, pays 25 per cent of the doctor's fee if he or she is in a private hospital and is paying over and over again. There is no justice in asking a private patient who goes to a public hospital for his or her fund to pay that amount in the public hospital. That person's levy payments should be taken into consideration and he or she should get the same treatment as someone else who is getting that treatment in a public hospital. I found it interesting that the Committee would recommend deregulation in community rating to allow experience rating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the recess I was referring to the fact that the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance was recommending that deregulation of the insurance industry should look at getting rid of community rating and, instead, should look at experience rating, for example, by age, gender or group. I presume that means non-smokers or similar groups. It seems incredible to me that the Committee would go as far as to say that the industry should be deregulated to a very large extent by allowing it to opt out of the community rating and go into experience rating or at least that it should even be looked at. There are so many things against experience rating and, indeed, the Committee says further that the problems with experience rating could be overcome by having priorities made for the aged and chronically ill, for instance that they could be permitted to enter public hospitals first. The Committee acknowledges that there are a lot of problems with experience rating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later the Committee recommends that the Government should get into the private health insurance industry in a big way and to regulate it in another sphere. It recommended that the costs of standard fees for accommodation, approved surgical implant prostheses and same day treatment in public hospitals, including gap cover for 100 per cent of the medical benefits schedule should be mandatory for private funds. I find those two recommendations hard to understand. One recommendation says that the industry should be deregulated to a large degree and another says that it be regulated in another area. If surgical implant prostheses were included, the cover for private medical insurance would have to go up. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another main recommendation of the Committee which stated that National Health Strategy, known as the Macklin inquiry, establish a working party to examine the likely impact of reforming private hospitals and medical insurance. I do not know the Committee was set up. I thought that that Committee was to look at this matter but it seems to have ducked for cover. The Government has also indicated that it believes the Committee has already ducked for cover because it has handed the report on to the Macklin inquiry. The Federal Government has said nothing in its response to the report that would indicate that it was taking up any of the recommendations. It has handed the whole caboose over to the Macklin inquiry and the Committee is saying that it is not prepared to go into this matter in detail and that the Macklin inquiry should take it on by establishing a working party. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only a few moments left tonight and I would like to discuss just one other area in the report which I find incredible. The report says that the Committee could not find any evidence that Medicare had encouraged overuse of either medical or hospital services. I find that quite unbelievable because I know that several years ago the Joint Committee of Public Accounts dealt with this matter. Mr Deputy President, you will remember the Edelsten case in which there was tremendous controversy. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts found that Medicare had formed the basis of the overservicing, when it had inquired into that particular clinic, and that, had it not been for Medicare and the bulk billing that had been brought in under Medicare, Dr Edelsten would not have been able to rort the system in the way in which he had. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that Medicare had instigated all these entrepreneurial groups-not even doctors, but groups-of businessmen who set up these clinics and the overservicing that has gone on is not just in my imagination, because the Government has claimed it as well. Tonight Senator Herron said that to a large extent overservicing is attributable to these organisations. I believe that there is ample evidence and, as I said, the evidence brought forward by that particular Committee of the Parliament was sufficient. I cannot imagine how the Committee would have ignored that evidence and why that evidence had not been brought to its attention. Perhaps the Committee will have another look at it and put a small amendment to the report pointing out that that evidence is available, not only outside but also within the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be brief in speaking to the Government's response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, entitled Health Costs and Health Insurance, as one of the members who joined the Committee after 1 July 1990. At that stage the deliberations were fairly well down the track. However, we did undertake one set of hearings over two days in Sydney which I consider to be of great importance, great significance, and something I would like to recommend to other Committees, that is, we had an open forum. Prior to my going onto the Committee there had been a number of people coming before the Committee putting differing points of view. The private hospital associations, public hospital associations, private insurers and insurance companies were all disagreeing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This open forum enabled us to put about seven different groups together. We were the catalyst for discussion which opened the eyes of those who were appearing before us as to the complexities of the problem in relation to health insurance and health legislation. It is a very complex issue. It is one that we wrestled with for some time. I think that this open forum was of great value and of great benefit and has given rise to a number of recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased with the Government's report in response to our report and I thank it for congratulating us on our hard work because a lot of hard work was done on that matter. Former Senator Peter Baume representing the Liberal Party was on that Committee and his contribution needs to be recognised, as does that of Senator Crowley, the Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters has raised the issue of why we did refer a number of matters to the National Health Strategy, known as the Macklin inquiry. I think anyone would feel it was appropriate that we were looking at a small section of the health industry but when there is an inquiry on health matters, it is appropriate that we not come down with a number of conclusive and concrete recommendations but should make sure that our report was available for the inquiry. That is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also that our report has been used as one of the reference texts to National Health Strategy Background Paper No. 4, entitled A Healthy Risk? Use of Private Insurance. That report highlights what I thought was one of our key findings-that is, the complexity of private insurance arrangements. I agree fully with everybody who has written on this: private insurance arrangements are extremely complex, in the writing format and in the explanatory notes. I think there is a high degree of misconception and misunderstanding on the part of a number of people in the general community as to what their rights are when they have private insurance, at what level they have private insurance and how that impacts upon Medicare. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> Strategies to improve public understanding of these issues need to be developed so that people can make informed choices about the relative merits of Medicare and private health insurance. That is a very important point because that is a very complicated and unclear area. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some discussion about the relative merits of Medicare. For many years, I have been supporting, first, Medibank and then Medicare. With a health professional background, I have worked and cared for many people who felt discriminated against because they could not afford to buy private health insurance. In pre-Medibank days, someone visited people admitted to hospitals and conducted a means test. If the patient did not have a low enough income, they were classified as having to make a contribution. I have vivid recollections of people with chronic and acute illnesses, some of which were life threatening, signing themselves out of hospital because they could not afford what the health costs were going to be. </PARA>
<PARA> In the days of the Fraser Government, pre-1983, I worked in the community. I know of a number of families who did not get adequate care and medical attention for their children because they could not afford it and because they did not have health insurance. We need to remember that two million people, who should have had health insurance and were not covered under the previous arrangements, were forced to pay for every item of health cover or health treatment that they ever undertook. I know of people who could not afford health cover; I know of people who were eligible to be classified as disadvantaged but who did not want to be so classified. They did not want to be discriminated against; they did not want to be stigmatised by being labelled `disadvantaged'. If anybody wants to have a debate on Medicare, I am more than willing and more than ready to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government's response to this report. I also urge people to read Background Paper No. 4. I suggest that more people should work in the area of public health where they will learn what it is really like to have to balance a budget while one is sick.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>During 1989 both the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration completed inquiries into aspects of departmental annual reporting. Both Committees found extensive non-compliance with the guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports. The Senate Committee and some witnesses appearing before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts advocated a review of the guidelines by the Joint Committee and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The document before us today is the result of that review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry, which was numbered 304, found that for departmental accounting to be compatible with the emerging performance emphasis in management the approach to annual reporting must change fundamentally. If departments are to be judged by results, those results must be reported; and if annual reports are to facilitate and encourage assessment which emphasise results, annual reports must report those results. To do otherwise is to report, at most, half a satisfactory story. </PARA>
<PARA> The emphasis on results does not remove the requirement for reporting on resource usage and the methods employed. Parliament has an interest in what departments achieve, the cost of that achievement and whether the means used are acceptable. I am particularly pleased that the document before the Senate has consequently recommended clauses 26 and 27. Clause 26 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The annual report is to contain a separate section for each program, which discusses the major activities undertaken by the department.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 27 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The annual report is to identify the operational approaches adopted and issues confronted in the implementation or maintenance of each program over the past year. Descriptions are to be provided of program activities and outputs, including those related to or arising from evaluations and program planning and review exercises. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, I remind the Senate of the change of name of the explanatory notes to `Program Performance Statements', which more accurately reflects the role of those statements. Program performance statements address the separate and more strategic issue of whether the activities have been effective in meeting program objectives. Unlike annual reports, the program performance statements present both a retrospective and prospective view of program performance and resourcing. In addition to reporting on outcomes for the past year, program performance statements present the strategies to be pursued and the outcomes sought for the coming year and identify the resources required to achieve them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased to see that the guidelines have incorporated recommendations Nos. 9 and 23 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I quote firstly recommendation No. 9:</PARA>
<PARA>Departments which perceive a need to produce an annual account of their operations for public relations purposes consider the cost effectiveness of producing a smaller document for that purpose if the annual report is considered too large.</PARA>
<PARA>For some time it has been a criticism that too much money has been spent on lavish reports. Recommendation No. 23 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Departments take necessary measures to ensure that they are able to reasonably estimate the costs and benefits of significant changes in business regulations for which the relevant Minister has responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>Those recommendations are there for departmental heads and parliamentarians to note. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes new legislation to provide bounty assistance to Australian manufacturers of citric acid by fermentation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision announced in the Industry Statement to provide bounty support for the continued development and commercialisation of leading edge Australian fermentation technology in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>The bounty arrangements contained in this legislation provide in clause 9 for a bounty to be paid at a rate of $700 per tonne in the first year reducing to $150 per tonne in the final year. The bounty applies to citric acid produced from 12 March 1991 to 31 December 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>While the support relates only to the production of citric acid by fermentation, it has much wider strategic implications for the development of an Australian fermentation-based biotechnology industry. </PARA>
<PARA>A particular opportunity for Australia, given its competitive advantages in agricultural production, is the production of organic chemicals based on the fermentation of carbohydrates such as wheat and sugar. These chemicals are widely used in the food, cosmetic and health industries and include: proteins, enzymes, antibiotics, vitamins, amino acids, gums and organic acids. </PARA>
<PARA>The world market for chemicals produced by fermentation is estimated to be in excess of $10 billion per annum and, in the longer term, the technology offers the opportunity to replace many petrochemicals with ecologically sustainable products as well as to develop export opportunities in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. </PARA>
<PARA>At the moment, however, the realisation of this potential is severely threatened by price distortions in both the domestic and overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA>Domestically, the structural adjustment arrangements currently in place for the sugar industry substantially increase the price of sugar over that available to producers in competitor countries. In this regard, opposition by the Coalition in the Senate precluded the adoption of the Government's original tariff proposals for the sugar industry which would have had less impact on domestic sugar users. Whilst a speeding up of tariff reductions on sugar was announced by the Government in the economic statement, domestic prices are likely to remain substantially above world prices for some time. This issue will continue to be addressed in the context of the forthcoming Industry Commission inquiry into the sugar industry due to report in March next year. </PARA>
<PARA>Internationally, governments are intervening to assist the production of citric acid and other fermentation based chemicals through subsidizing the price of fermentation substrates and by providing tariff protection to their local industries. </PARA>
<PARA>EEC producers, for example, are able to purchase sugar or other carbohydrate substrates at world competitive prices through a system of rebates on raw material costs. </PARA>
<PARA>In contrast to the duty free access of citric acid to the Australian market, tariffs of 30% apply in Indonesia, 24% in Japan and 6.0% in the USA. Imports into Australia are mainly from Ireland, China, US and Indonesian producers which benefit not only from subsidized raw material costs but also a protected domestic market. In other words, a combination of domestic and international policies have distorted the operating environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1984, Sirius Biotechnology Limited has been developing technology in this field, originally invented by CSIRO. Some $14 million of shareholders funds has already been committed to the development of the technology and the commissioning of scale up production facilities. The first product developed by Sirius has been citric acid. </PARA>
<PARA>Sirius has also developed strong strategic linkages with industry and the research community. Research into a number of other applications of the technology is currently underway in collaboration with the CSIRO and the University of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>In recognition of the strategic importance of the technology, its development has been strongly supported by the Government through the industrial research and development board programs. Sirius has received $375,000 in grants relating to citric acid production, and research projects with the CSIRO and University of Melbourne are receiving a total of $932,000 in Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of the Sirius operation derives not only from the commercial opportunities for the technology. The skills and production facilities at Sirius represent a key base on which future fermentation based biotechnology potential can be built in Australia and are not available elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the importance of the Sirius technology and production facilities as the foundation of a carbohydrate-based fermentation industry in Australia, the Government has decided to introduce this bounty assistance scheme. The bounty is to be payable on the production in Australia of citric acid by the high technology production process involving the fermentation of carbohydrates in air lift fermenters. This is contained in clause 4 and clause 6 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The bounty is not a protection measure but is a support mechanism aimed at offsetting the distortions which prevent the intrinsic competitiveness of the Sirius technology being realised, enabling the company to achieve commercial viability in citric acid production. </PARA>
<PARA>This will provide a vehicle for the continued development and commercialization of the technology in new areas and the maintenance of a unique production facility in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In reaching a decision to provide support for this high technology production process, the Government considers it appropriate to make the bounty assistance contingent on a number of conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>This will be achieved by requiring bounty recipients to be registered under the Act, with registration subject to:</PARA>
<PARA>First, that the bounty recipient continue to research, develop and apply the technology to the commercialisation of citric acid in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>Second, that the bounty recipient contribute to research in new product development arising from or associated with the fermentation technology the subject of the bounty, with a view to the commercialisation of those new products in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>Third, that the bounty recipient explore international market opportunities for the technology and the product; and</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, that the bounty recipient take all reasonable steps to ensure maximum advantage is taken from the expertise and know-how associated with the development and production of citric acid and other new products in Australia by suitable licensing, franchise or other arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers support in the form of a production bounty, incorporating the conditions I have mentioned, is the most appropriate form of assistance. The level of support will be linked to success in commercialising the technology in Australia and it directly addresses the pricing distortions.</PARA>
<PARA>Sirius will need to make substantial investments in plant expansion in order to benefit fully from the support and its major shareholder, Bunge Industrial Limited, has indicated it will be commencing a program of research aimed at reducing the cost of wheat based fermentation substrates. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is firmly committed to realising opportunities to apply Australia's scientific and research skills to the development of new industries in Australia. Few areas offer better opportunities than technologies which add value to Australia's intrinsic strengths in agricultural production, particularly in the food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics sectors. The bounty, which is the subject of this legislation, is aimed at ensuring that the opportunity to capitalise on Australian developed technology for citric acid production as well as to build a substantial chemical fermentation industry in Australia, is not lost overseas. In addition, the bounty will position Australia to develop a strong international competitive base upon which to achieve significant net export growth across a number of sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The amount of money available for the payment of bounty, or advances on account of bounty, under this scheme is limited by that amount which is appropriated by the Parliament for that purpose. This limitation is contained in subclause 11(2) and clause (30) of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>It is anticipated that the total cost of this bounty will be $7.27 million (in current prices) on a financial year breakdown as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> $1.05 million for 1991-92</PARA>
<PARA> $1.65 million for 1992-93</PARA>
<PARA> $2.17 million for 1993-94</PARA>
<PARA> $1.85 million for 1994-95</PARA>
<PARA> $0.55 million for 1995-96. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the annual report of the Privacy Commissioner was addressed some weeks ago in the chamber, and I spoke on it then, more examples of corruption have been revealed by the investigations of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) being undertaken at the moment. Evidence has come to light since I last spoke that the ANZ Bank has regularly obtained information from private investigators relating to the Department of Social Security (DSS), Medicare, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Telecom Australia and Australia Post. The Westpac Banking Corporation has obtained government information from private investigators in a similar way to ANZ. The National Australia Bank Ltd has also obtained confidential government information from DSS, Telecom, Medicare, Australia Post and the Australian Customs Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through the ICAC investigations, it has also been demonstrated that one official from the Department of Social Security disclosed information about clients of DSS over a period of 15 years. When he left the Department, he passed on that role to another senior person in the Department. So the next person in line took on the role of providing that information. The second officer who provided the information, after the first officer's retirement, had responsibilities which included security of the DSS computer system. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that this sort of evidence is coming out of ICAC. The Privacy Commissioner has, over two years-I have noted this before when speaking on the report-called on the Government to bring into force amendments to the Privacy Act to allow him to investigate the circumstances surrounding these events and also to investigate un- authorised disclosures. He wants the Privacy Act amended to allow him to impose liability for damages on those who procure the improper disclosure of such information and also to tighten up the criminal law so that it is amended to enable the prosecution of those who are party to these transactions and to place some liability on the principals. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing has been done. Senator Tate has said that a code of conduct is being drawn up, but how, when and in what circumstances information about credit commitments should be disclosed has yet to be decided. Senator Tate claims that the aim of the legislation and the code of conduct is to require the consumer credit reporting industry to observe principles of privacy. But there is no mention that the code will make any mention of the direct or indirect use of personal government information that has been corruptly disclosed by public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> There are usually two parties in these things-a debt collecting agency, or an information service that provides information to organisations such as banks, and the public servant at the other end providing the information. There is no point in having legislation or codes which place restrictions on the debt collecting agency if there is no concomitant legislation to ensure that the information is not freely available, especially when we have recently had discussions about the claims transmission system that pharmacists will be using. Under that system, there will be more information available in the public arena-names and addresses of people-which can be used inappropriately. I think that as a society and as a parliament we need to address those issues. I am again calling on the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to address them. I have already discussed this with the Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that has come out of ICAC is the extent of corruption. Each week we are seeing more and more evidence of the extent of the corruption, which is of great concern. It ought to be of concern to all senators in this chamber that information about individuals, given for the purpose of social security or because one is receiving medical treatment, is then used and abused in other forums. I think we need to address this. I think that I need to constantly bring to the attention of this chamber the evidence that is coming out of ICAC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Anti-Dumping Authority on its annual report and the work it does in investigating and identifying areas of dumping goods onto Australian markets. The report notes that under current Australian law the Government may take action against only one kind of dumping-that is, dumping which causes or threatens material injury to the Australian industry producing like goods to those being dumped, or which materially hinders the establishment of such an industry. A broadly similar rule applies in the case of subsidisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the year of investigation, the Anti-Dumping Authority looked into a wide range of cases ranging from black lead pencils to outboard motors, woven bags, woven worsted fabrics, audio tape webs, cement clinker and bulk brandy. I do not know much about many of these goods, but I do know a little about the wide range of horticultural goods which are currently being dumped onto the Australian domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Boswell has raised this issue on many occasions. He has spoken of the plight of many farmers who not only have to fight the rural crisis but also see their products competing on the supermarket shelves with goods dumped from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year I was able to speak to a motion raised by Senator Boswell on anti-dumping legislation. I was glad to be able to take part in that debate. Similarly, I was very pleased to be able to attend a luncheon last week when the anti-dumping committee was in Kingaroy looking at the problems being caused by dumping to the peanut industry and the navy bean industry in our town and district. </PARA>
<PARA> In the midst of the crisis currently hitting our rural community, Australia is importing about $2 billion worth of food products every year. Australian horticultural products are fast becoming an endangered species. The list is growing every week. First it was pineapples. Now it is bananas, canned fruit, peanuts, navy beans, peas, beetroot, beans, potatoes and other vegetables as well as apricots, dried vine fruits, rice, orange juice, apple juice, jams, mushrooms, dairy products and fresh meat. As Senator Boswell said last year:</PARA>
<PARA>A whole smorgasbord of imported foods is entering our market as cheap and subsidised products. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time our farmers are having to plough back their products into the soil. This problem is not just one for farmers, but we can understand how farmers feel about the matter. I feel very upset about it. Certainly, too, I can understand housewives who under current economic circumstances try to buy the cheapest products when shopping. Who can blame them when we have seen our household incomes seriously eroded since this Government came to power? Many of those households now face life on the dole as unemployment rises, which the figures released today indicate. It is very sad that this figure has now rocketed to 9.2 per cent unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, any sensible shopper will try to cut costs by buying cheaper brands, but with many of these dumped brands the products are not as tasty or as nutritious as Australian-grown fruit and vegetables. Most housewives would know that Australian-grown and Australian-processed products guarantee the best quality in the world. Our goods are grown under strict guidelines and processed under high standards of hygiene using the best and most advanced technology available. However, it is not only the farmers who suffer from the dumping of these products. Almost every part of the Australian community, both in the city and in the country, is affected. There is an entire support network servicing these farmers and their products, which is also affected. I am talking about the rural communities, the transport workers, the processors, the cannery workers, the packers, the storemen, the factory workers and, of course, in the end all Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said on this issue last year, it is bad enough that Australian farmers are suffering because of irresponsible policies of this Government and then having to compete in a corrupt and dishonest world trading market, but dumped products add another dimension to the problems of the rural industries. It means that farmers are having to compete on their home turf with inferior products which are deliberately dumped onto our domestic market. I commend the Authority on its excellent report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Grants Commission Report on Interstate Distribution of General Purposes Grants for Local Government is a very important document, particularly for local government. It results from a reference that was given to the Grants Commission by the former Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Stewart West, and following the decision made at the Premiers Conference on 18 May 1989. In those terms of reference the feasibility of three options was included. The major one in which local government is interested relates to whether the application of the principle of fiscal equalisation was appropriate to determine the distribution of this assistance in the future. I, like many of my colleagues, and I imagine quite a few members of the Government and perhaps the Australian Democrats, have received many letters from different local government bodies since this report was put down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Local government representatives, quite rightly, ask why local government funds should be distributed in a different way from the way in which the States are funded. The States have been funded under a fiscal equalisation principle for many years, yet local government has had different and varying methods of funding for quite some time. When I was a warden of a municipality in Tasmania our funding was distributed under a system of part needs and part per capita funding. The Government decided to adopt one of the recommendations of the report of the Self National Inquiry into Local Government Finance and move to the funding of local government on a per capita basis, and in the past five years this has happened. That has had varying effects on different councils. In Tasmania, for instance, we have gone from around 3.4 per cent of the funding down to about 2.1 per cent, and in the last year we received a minus percentage increase. On the other hand, those States with a large populace in local government areas received more under the per capita system. Now it seems that the role will be reversed, and it is not surprising that local government authorities in New South Wales and Victoria are making their voices heard. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at some of the theoretical results, at what could happen under fiscal equalisation, one notes that New South Wales, which currently receives $243m, would possibly receive only $81.9m. Victoria would go from $182m to $90m. That is under a complementary relativities system. To make matters a little more complicated-and the Treasury and the Office of Local Government support fiscal equalisation in principal-the present Government, I understand, intends to absorb road funding into general purpose assistance grants. If we look at what could happen under that scenario, we would find that in total New South Wales, for instance, which would have received $320m, would have its funding reduced by $176m to $144m. Obviously one can understand why New South Wales is getting upset. </PARA>
<PARA> Set out in the report are three options. The first option relates to a system that is similar to State Government funding; option two contains some variations; and option three has even more variations. It is not the last we shall hear about this matter. I shall be interested to learn the attitude of the Australian Local Government Association. It has not yet decided on its attitude to the report, but whatever happens I hope that parochial matters or parochial interests in different States will not have the effect of ruining what I believe is a very good report which has set out for everyone to see the options that might occur in the future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The reports of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody make for very sober reading. They all highlight the tragic details of lives lost unnecessarily, and the documentation in this report of the life and death of Faith Barnes is particularly poignant. Not much is known about Faith Barnes, but what is known presents a depressing picture. It is not even certain where or when she was born. She was probably born in Kalgoorlie, as this is more commonly given in government records as her place of birth. </PARA>
<PARA> Her mother died in August 1957 when Faith was not yet three. Little is also known of her childhood or her schooling. Apart from the respiratory problems, which led to her hospitalisation at Princess Margaret Hospital, Faith Barnes suffered during her childhood from a considerable number of minor ailments of a kind which generally result from poverty and deprived living conditions. These are noted on her records from the Menzies Nursing Post and include sore eyes, infected wounds, burns, boils and scabies. </PARA>
<PARA> Between the time when she was 21 and her death at the age of 27, Barnes was the victim of numerous severe assaults. She was admitted to Kalgoorlie Regional Hospital for head injuries on five occasions, received outpatient treatment on two occasions and was treated at the Menzies Nursing Post on nine occasions for head injuries. During this period she also received treatment many times for other traumatic injuries to various parts of her body. </PARA>
<PARA> On 21 October 1982, only a week before her death, she again attended the hospital. It was noted that she was having difficulty in breathing and smelled of alcohol. She complained of pains in her chest and thought that she was at risk of having a fit. The report says that attendances such as this may have represented a cry for help from a person who retained sufficient insight to perceive the hopelessness of her own condition. </PARA>
<PARA> The death of Faith Barnes presents a picture now familiar to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. At about 11 am on 26 October 1982, she was found lying, apparently asleep, in the street beside the Kalgoorlie Police Station. She had, it seems, been there for at least an hour. Known to have an alcohol problem, she was thought to be drunk and taken to the lockup without any further inquiry being made as to the cause of her unconsciousness. She could not be roused and had to be carried or partly dragged to the exercise yard where she was left lying on the bare concrete. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of cell checks were made between that time and four in the afternoon when it was noticed that there was dried blood on the side of her head. After further attempts to rouse her were unsuccessful an ambulance was called and she was taken to the Kalgoorlie Regional Hospital. There Barnes was found to be semiconscious but unresponsive to spoken command. </PARA>
<PARA> Admitted in the early hours of the following morning, she was found to have a severe head injury. An emergency operation was performed to remove blood clots from inside her skull. After surgery had been completed she suffered an unexpected cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful and she was declared dead at 7.36 on the morning of 27 October, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Faith Barnes did have a severe alcohol problem. The report concludes that her treatment by those who took her into custody at Kalgoorlie for the last time was totally devoid of kindness or humane consideration and that her treatment at the hands of some members of her own community was even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1975 and her death she received medical treatment for head injuries on at least 16 occasions, being admitted to hospital on at least five of these occasions. A proportion of these injuries resulted from severe assaults. She was also treated for other traumatic injuries at various times. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not know how she came by the severe head injury which caused her death, but however she did come by it the neglect demonstrated by the Kalgoorlie police responsible for her custody is described by this report as `disgraceful'. She should never have been placed in custody in her semiconscious condition without a prior medical examination to ensure that her unconsciousness was alcohol related as thought and not caused by injury or illness. </PARA>
<PARA> The report claims that the indifference of those responsible is even more reprehensible when one considers that another Aboriginal, Roy Norman Walker, had died the previous year after being held in custody in the same lockup in similar circumstances; that is to say, while unconscious as the result of a severe head injury when thought to be drunk. </PARA>
<PARA> Her death is associated with a neglect not only by those responsible for her custody but also by the wider community, which regards those known as fringe dwellers as a public nuisance to be put out of sight and out of mind. I quote from the conclusion of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Until the community addresses the problems of these unfortunate people, they will continue to die like Faith Barnes in circumstances which will bring them back to haunt the conscience of thinking Australians. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Bernard Albert McGrath was in a public house when he was apprehended under authority of a warrant by two police officers, one of whom was Senior Constable Suiter who knew Bernard. </PARA>
<PARA> Bernard was asked to leave the tavern with police officers and did so without offering any resistance. He was then taken to the Kalgoorlie Police Station and lodged in the lockup shortly after 11.50 p.m. This case is important because it concerns an Aboriginal person in the custody of police who was, on the evidence before the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, killed-probably by other prisoners also present in the gaol. Therefore, the police failed in their duty to properly supervise persons in their custody and, a little like the Gundy case, continued to cover up, after the death was discovered, the circumstances in which Mr McGrath met his death. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the facts of the case. Bernard was not eligible for bail, essentially for the reason that the warrant commanded that he be apprehended and brought before the Kalgoorlie Court of Petty Sessions to answer the complaint that he failed to complete 50 hours of community service as ordered previously in 1986. We should pause and consider that here we have a person who had failed to complete 50 hours of community service-obviously a penalty imposed commensurate with an offence which could not have been too serious and which was given to him to enable him to rehabilitate himself, and yet in these circumstances he met his death. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence before the Commission shows that Mr McGrath was placed in the lockup together with two other prisoners who, previous to the events described in this report, claimed that he had on numerous occasions-including to some police officers-made the comment that he wished to kill himself. Upon being placed in the cell with those two prisoners, he took a towel and tried to place it around his neck and on a doorknob. Subsequently, evidence was given by one of the other prisoners that another had torn a strip from a towel, put it around Bernard's neck and around the doorknob and virtually said, `Well, there you go'. This happened while Mr McGrath was in the custody of police in a police station. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the constables were subsequently charged under police regulations and convicted for their failure to act on the claim of one other-a third prisoner who reported the death but who was not believed by the police who were in another part of the police station. The total sum of these events showed an extremely casual, not to say contentious, attitude by the authorities to people in their custody. </PARA>
<PARA> It does recall to our minds the fact that we have just passed in this Senate the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill, which limits the time that police officers may inter- rogate the person. There has been a fair amount of controversy about the restrictions that we are able to place on police officers. I believe that events such as the death of Mr McGrath fully justify caution to the extent to which we are prepared to give latitude to law enforcement officers. These are the persons who are not used to our legal system but are placed in their custody. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak to this report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody which concerns the inquiry into the death of Ricci John Vicenti. Ricci died at the age of 19 in the Royal Perth Hospital late on the evening of 31 March 1982. He had been shot in the head by an armed prison guard in the course of his attempted escape from the remand centre in Canning Vale. Vicenti was a remand prisoner at the time he was shot, having been remanded by a magistrate in the East Perth Court of Petty Sessions for the preparation of the pre-sentence report which was put in, having admitted four charges of breaking, entering and stealing. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to effect his escape, Vicenti somehow climbed on top of the roof and negotiated a number of walls and barbed wire entanglements. He was seen by a prison officer, who warned him and subsequently fired a warning shot which was well wide of the prisoner. When Vicenti tried to escape, the prison officer shot, aiming not to kill, according to his evidence, but at the lower mass of the body. These were the words of the prison officer. As it was, the shot actually lodged in the head of Vicenti who died. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no suggestion in the report that the prison officer concerned acted in excess of the regulation covering his behaviour. It would appear that prison officers in this situation, after having warned an escaping prisoner and having fired a warning shot, may then shoot to kill. I believe that this raises the question of whether we, as a civilised society in these circumstances, should condone such actions and whether we feel that prisoners who are in an institution and try to escape should do so at the risk of their lives. We should consider carefully whether we wish to place people's lives at risk in that sense and whether the protection of property and public law and order extends to the licence to kill when somebody in custody attempts to flee. I leave that question open for the consideration of honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the Advance to the Minister for Finance for March 1991. I particularly want to take note of the advances through the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to the Antarctic Division. The first part of the Advance requires an amount of $67,720 for the purpose of providing for the transport program to resupply the stations, et cetera. Attached to that is a letter from the Assistant Secretary of the Portfolio Coordination Branch to the Secretary to the Department of Finance. I actually get a mention in that letter because I had previously raised the matter about the spillage of station fuel and, as is pointed out in this letter, I was totally incorrect. I apologise to the Senate for making a comment that a few hundred thousand litres of oil was spilt when, in fact, only about 20,000 litres of station fuel was spilt. I certainly was wrong. I think it was a slip of the tongue because I was aware that it certainly was not hundreds of thousands of litres. But, anyway, I probably got carried away in the heat of the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, there is a difference in what I had believed because the original $700,000 extra asked for was, of course, for bunker fuel. The reason is that the price of bunker fuel oil increased quite startlingly because of the Gulf war situation. I am pleased to note that there was then a credit of $81,000 because of a reduction in the price during the course of those negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The second request is for an amount of $158,696 to effect a legal settlement. It does not mention here what it is about and I have no argument about its correctness. But I will be pursuing that matter in Estimates committees to find out what it is about, because $158,696 does seem a fair amount of money in relation to a legal settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The first application talks about extra contractual requirements for the Aurora Australis and the Iceberg. I might just pass on to the Senate a matter I noted during the week regarding the Aurora Australis because I think it is rather sad. A magazine article from the Australian Ships and Ports magazine of March-April 1991 is headlined `Carrington Slipways in receivership-What happened?'. Through the article it says what went wrong. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Carrington Slipways was a close knit family type of organisation. It appears that some of the founding members of the team left the company and the successful ingredient which was then lost, needed to be reworked. Whether or not the new team were galvanised as well as the original team will never be known. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on the article points out:</PARA>
<PARA>Without doubt the mortal blow to Carrington Slipways was the construction of the icebreaker `Aurora Australis'. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This vessel . . . should have been constructed overseas. No doubt through the Australian Government's wishes, the `Aurora Australis' was built in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>I have always supported the building of the Aurora Australis in Australia and I am on record as saying that. But I was against the fact that, through matters which the Auditor-General has already pointed out, contractual agreements between P and O Polar, Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd and the Government in fact cost Australia $25m more than it should have. Anyway, it is very sad to see that Carrington has gone into receivership. I still believe the decision to build the ship in Australia was right. I was very concerned to read this article. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue my remarks on the annual report of the Australian Institute of Criminology. Senator Baume has already referred to the timing of this particular report, with qualifications, and I will not go into that aspect. An institute such as this is regarded as having a function of rigorous research and members of parliament should be able to presume that an organisation which receives in excess of $3m of taxpayers' money should be beyond reproach in its research activities. The Institute does of course conduct some very interesting, detailed and rigorous research, but its credibility is undermined by the selection of one or two researchers-particularly the Deputy Director of Research, Dr Wilson-as publicists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it comes to the question of the credibility of this organisation, I refer particularly to the continuing attempts by Dr Wilson of the Australian Institute of Criminology to belittle the work, or at least the overall majority view, of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material so far as that view relates to X-rated videos. That Committee held extensive discussions and received extensive evidence, yet Dr Wilson continues to quote the National Committee on Violence which he and the Institute acknowledge paid scant attention to the question. Indeed, at the last Estimates Committee E hearings-I refer to pages E99 to E103 of the Hansard-I challenged Dr Wilson about an article that he had written. I referred to a statement by Dr Wilson from an article which appeared in the Melbourne Herald on 21 February 1990, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite intense pressure, the committee-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Committee on Violence-</PARA>
<PARA>in its final report backed away from advocating increased censorship of X-rated movies. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Wilson admitted that there was no intense pressure. I invite honourable senators to read that article. Honourable senators might recall that the same Dr Wilson criticised the findings of the Meese Commission on Pornography in the United States and cited, in support of his opposition, persons named Nobile and Nadler. It was not until later that we found out that Nobile and Nadler were, respectively, the Editor and Deputy Editor of Penthouse Forum magazine. In fact, Professor Donald Downs, in an article in the American Bar Foundation Research Journal, said of Nobile and Nadler:</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, Nobile and Nadler are absolutist libertarians with axes to grind . . . not only do they reject any restraints on sexual material . . . but they treat all opposing views as presumptively illegitimate and intolerable. </PARA>

<PARA>I was struck this morning by a news report, the first few lines of which I will read. It had come in from Cukurca in Turkey and it stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Six small bodies of Iraqi refugee children, wrapped in muddy wet towels, lay in the mosque of this border village today. </PARA>
<PARA> They had perished of cold at a makeshift camp overflowing with families who fled Iraq in terror of Saddam Hussein and who are now fighting to survive freezing rain and hunger. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Kill me,'' shouted Ihsan, a middle-aged Iraqi jostling with a soldier trying to push back crowds fighting for bread. ``Drop a chemical bomb on us. It is better than dying slowly like this.'' Two other bodies lay beside the dead children in the mosque-a man of 40 who died of exposure and a girl of 18.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of enormous international embarrassment. It is something of which the entire international community should be ashamed. At the end of the Gulf war the Kurds and other minorities were encouraged by the allies-and we should remember that Australia was part of that alliance-to rise up and replace Saddam Hussein. But they had no capacity to do so and they have been ruthlessly dealt with by Hussein's military. They have fled to the north, to the borders of Turkey and Iran. We are told that on the Turkish border there are now some 300,000 Kurds; some on the Turkish side of the border and some still on the Iraqi side. Some have been restrained from crossing the border, an area of windswept mountainous terrain. At this time of the year it is freezing cold. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Iran border there are even many more. It is estimated that there are about 900,000, expected to rise to perhaps 2 million, and many have crossed as Iran has allowed more to cross, although there have been recent reports that that border has closed as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The ceasefire agreement that was negotiated at the end of the war contains no protection for minorities. It did, in fact, permit the retention and use of helicopters by Saddam Hussein from which he has attacked the Kurds, his own people, since. The subsequent Security Council resolution on the ceasefire to which I referred a moment ago, although in many ways the most comprehensive resolution of its kind in the history of the United Nations (UN), also gave no security for the Iraq minorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia could have lobbied for the inclusion of such protections in that resolution but it failed to do so. We raised the question with Senator Gareth Evans the other day as to why Australia did not argue for the inclusion of such basic protections in the resolution, as we lobby for many variations to Security Council resolutions even though we are not presently a member of the Council. Senator Evans's reply to that question was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is well aware of all of these developments as they are occurring in the United Nations, and it is simply a matter of making a judgement as to whether or not there is anything more we can usefully do than is already happening as these things are negotiated to fruition. We made the judgement that, particularly given our status as not being a current member of the Security Council, there was little we could add to a very lively debate on these issues that was already proceeding. That is the view that we continue to hold. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a most disappointing statement from the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Basically, it is a statement in which he indicates that Australia washed its hands of the issue because it was too difficult, it was a complex matter and we are not currently a member of the Security Council. As he said, in his view there was little that we could constructively add, so we did not make any effort to include the basic protections that were necessary within that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who will argue-and it has been said by those defending this position on behalf of other nations-that it would be inappropriate for the United Nations to act because this is basically a matter internal to Iraq. I thought that that particular question was addressed very ably by Douglas Davis, a correspondent from London, reporting in the Australian on 5 April 1991. He looked at that question and said:</PARA>
<PARA>But such a narrow, legalistic ledge is proving to be a perilous perch for those who seek to justify their position on the spectator stands of this tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not express it any better than that, because that is exactly what Australia has done-it has stood on the spectator stands of this tragedy and has taken no action at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The narrow, legalistic ledge that he talked about simply does not stand up to current analysis. The UN Security Council resolution which was passed shortly after the one on the ceasefire condemning the abuse of the Kurds, in fact, leaves open the capacity for the UN to maintain its sanctions against Iraq while these abuses continue. So the United Nations, through that, has indicated that there are sufficient international aspects to this conflict to allow it to so act. We already have the precedent that the United Nations will not rely on that narrow, legalistic ledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the abuse that is occurring at the moment in Iraq arose out of the war and the settlement of the war which, of course, was an international matter. What is particularly distressing is that one suspects that it would have required little or no enforcement. If, at the time of the ceasefire, when Saddam Hussein's generals sat down in the tent, they had been told that one of the conditions that they would be expected to comply with was to demonstrate respect for their own people, I am sure that no further action would have been taken. Saddam Hussein was simply not in a position to negotiate, in the same way that he did not negotiate any of the other terms that were imposed upon him in that ceasefire. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a lesson that we have not learned. One suspects that if the international community had been equally as firm with Saddam Hussein when he was demonstrating an intention to invade Kuwait, indicating that it would have been intolerable to the world community and would have brought a massive response, that invasion would not have taken place. But the message was not given on either occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was it not given? One suspects because of fears of the reaction of countries such as Iran, Turkey, Syria and the Soviet Union, all with Kurdish communities; fears that if the Kurds gained autonomy, or some form of independence in Iraq, perhaps that sentiment might spread to adjoining countries' Kurdish populations and that would be something that they would regard as unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> There were also concerns about encouraging other minorities. As the Senate is aware, at this invitation of the international community the Shi'ites also rose up in southern Iraq and were beaten down, and the international community stood aside, one suspects because the Shi'ites were supported by Iran and there was a view that Iran should not be given any further encouragement or be allowed to attain a power base within what is now Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> What that means is that the old balance of power arguments still rank supreme, and the question of balance of power is seen as more important than basic humanitarian concerns. It demonstrates what little progress has really been made towards-using this engaging expression-a new world order. It indicates that there is such a long way for the international community to go before it is prepared to use its international might to stop the sorts of abuses that we are witnessing in Iraq at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we have not observed the lessons of history. If we look at the Kurds, they have been abused over the centuries by the Persians, the Turks-the Ottoman Empire-the Arabs and, in more recent times, Saddam Hussein in the most atrocious way that one could imagine. Whereas they may now say that they were encouraged by the international community to rise up, in the mid-1980s they were encouraged in Iraq by Iran to rise up during the time of the Iran-Iraq war, and they did so. At the end of that war, in 1987, the revenge of Saddam Hussein upon them was absolutely appalling. One remembers the use of poison gas. In one village alone more than 4,000 Kurds died in a cloud of poisonous gas-that is the town of Halabja-according to the magazine the Economist which has not been disputed. In 1988 the Iraqi offensive to put down the Kurds was brutally effective. </PARA>
<PARA> What then happened is that they were forcibly moved by Saddam Hussein out of their villages. It is believed that four of every five Kurdish villages in Iraq were levelled over the years by Saddam Hussein. They were forced to the south. Of course, after the victory of the allied forces they moved back to the north and sought to regain their ancestral lands, only to be attacked by Saddam again and forced to flee, as I said, to refuge in either Iraq or Turkey and to have the vengeance of helicopter gunships turned on them and even the Scud missiles that became so prominent during the war. </PARA>
<PARA> The world community has now finally reacted. There are those, particularly Britain, arguing for a temporary zone in the north of Iraq that will give them relief, and that has some international support. Although the United States does not quite support it in those terms at the moment, it has nevertheless taken the step that I and many others would have liked to see it take some time ago, and that has at least delineated part of Iraq in which it will not tolerate Saddam Hussein attacking his own people. The British, I am pleased to say, see this as only a temporary measure. Their second objective after the provision of a short term safe haven is to enable the refugees to return to the safety of their homes. That must be the ultimate objective. </PARA>
<PARA> We are faced with an immediate humanitarian concern to which we must respond. I am pleased that the Australian Government is at least providing a minor response in the form of some money. We will no doubt be faced with a refugee question to which we and the rest of the international community must positively respond. But the real answer is to ensure that conditions pertain in Iraq that will allow the Kurdish people to return to their homelands and to be able to live their lives in security and peace. </PARA>
<PARA> A delegation of Kurds visited this place the day before yesterday and saw the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and I saw them with Dr Hewson on behalf of the Opposition. They made the point that their community was not looking for independence; they did not want an independent state, which they once had. They asked for reasonable autonomy so that they could practice their religion and their culture, and peace and security in their ancestral lands, which does not seem to be an unreasonable request. They asked the international community to ensure that those reasonable conditions upon which they could live were open to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge this motion upon the Senate in circumstances in which I do not think Australia can be proud of its contribution to date. I particularly urge as most important the last paragraph of the motion, which proposes that the Senate urge the Security Council, on behalf of the international community, to take such action as is necessary to bring to an end this human tragedy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Hill dealing with the tragic situation of the Kurdish people. First of all, I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that this is not the only motion of which notice has been given this week dealing with this situation. I gave notice of a motion on Tuesday in the Senate and Senator Vallentine yesterday gave notice of a motion on the same matter. I think Senator Hill moved his today, and I do not know from the record whether any other senators moved motions dealing with the situation of the Kurds. This is a matter of considerable concern to all members of parliament on all sides and to the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of people-members of the community in my own State-have spoken to me about what they have been observing on the television over the last couple of weeks concerning the terrible experience which ordinary Kurdish citizens are suffering as they attempt to flee the attacks of the army of Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I can agree with much of Senator Hill's motion, I cannot agree with parts of it, because I think he has attempted to bring a partisan note into this tragic situation by attacking the Australian Government. My motion dealt with the same issue. It read in part, `notes and supports the Government's speedy response'. I understand that the Opposition objected to that part of the motion yesterday and to the motion being dealt with as formal. I am not going to debate here at great length why I thought that was a reasonable proposition to put forward and why I think the Opposition was unreasonable to object to that so that the motion could not be treated as formal. In a moment I will give some details of the Australian Government's response to this tragic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that my motion could have been accepted quite reasonably by the Senate as a formal motion. There are parts of Senator Vallentine's notice of motion of yesterday which I would find totally objectionable and which I do not think are factually correct, but obviously she may argue with me about that. I think Senator Vallentine's notice of motion was based more on trying to justify her position in opposing the United Nations (UN) resolution, supported by the allies, to evict Iraq from Kuwait. I do not think Senator Vallentine does her cause much good by trying to blame the problems of the Kurdish people on the fact that the allies were successful in liberating Kuwait. She attempts also to try to talk about the new world order in a way that is quaint, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with Senator Hill's motion, which we now have before us, I would like to make a few comments, as a member of the Government, about what the true situation is and the way the Australian Government has quite responsibly responded to the developing situation. I think it has acted with all reasonable haste in dealing with a situation which is extremely complicated and is changing every day. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, like most members of the international community, has been appalled by the actions of the Iraqi armed forces in bombing, rocketing and shelling Kurdish civilians while putting down a revolt in northern Iraq over the past few weeks. The Australian Government has expressed its outrage as the full scale of the tragedy has emerged, and we have unreservedly condemned Saddam Hussein's Government for this latest example of unconscionable brutality. As a Government senator I take this opportunity again to repeat that condemnation, which all members of the Government would support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Iraqi Government's reaction to the Kurdish uprising was entirely in character. Over the last decade at least, Saddam Hussein's Government has demonstrated a degree of ruthlessness in suppressing domestic opposition and a disregard for human life in its international ventures unparalleled elsewhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been active in international forums, particularly the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in highlighting Iraq's human rights record. At the Commission this year, for instance, we co-sponsored a resolution appointing a special rapporteur to examine the human rights situation in Iraq. In 1988, the Iraqi military used chemical weapons against Kurdish civilians. I am sure that few of us can forget the photographs of women and children collapsed in doorways and on footpaths having been caught by the poisonous cloud of gas. Australia was one of the first countries to express its condemnation of that outrage and we moved quickly to provide an expert to the United Nations investigation of that tragic incident. </PARA>
<PARA> The UN Security Council resolution-resolution 687-establishing a cease-fire in the Gulf war was adopted on 2 April. It is probably the most complex resolution ever adopted by the Security Council, and the most intrusive in the sense of imposing international supervision of Iraq's disarmament program and of its reparation program for damage caused in Kuwait. Prior to its adoption, the resolution had been negotiated over more than two weeks, in the first instance amongst the permanent five members of the Security Council, then between the Permanent Five and other members of the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA> When the resolution was first drafted and throughout much of the negotiating period, the situation in Iraq was quite unclear. Kurdish rebels had captured several cities in the north and Shia rebels were making progress in the south. In this chaotic situation no-one knew whether Saddam Hussein's Government would survive. </PARA>
<PARA> By the time it became clear that the Iraqi forces were winning the war against the Kurds and that a flow of refugees had commenced, resolution 687 was in the final stages of negotiation. It was recognised then that any attempt to expand its ambit to provide protection of minorities inside Iraq would place at serious risk the consensus that had been painstakingly built up amongst the Permanent Five, jeopardising the prospects of the resolution being adopted by the Council. In short, the risk was that the baby would have been thrown out with the bath water. Instead, at France's suggestion, the question of the Kurds was dealt with in a separate resolution-resolution 688-which focuses international attention specifically on the repression of Iraqi civilians by the Iraqi armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the period of the negotiations of both resolutions, the Australian mission in New York was in close touch with the principals. Both there and in the capitals we exchanged ideas on the developing text. However, the reality is that Australia is not a member of the Security Council and thus does not have a direct input into the Council's deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Evans said on 9 April, the international community is now looking closely at how it can use the two resolutions to force the Iraqi Government to cease its repression of the Kurds. The Australian Government has given in-principle support to an idea endorsed by the European Community that a safe haven be set up inside Iraq under UN auspices, where civilians fleeing the fighting could take refuge from attack and where relief operations could be organised. As I have said before in other forums, and as Senator Evans has said in this place, the proposal raises complex issues going to the capacity of the UN to intervene directly in disputes occurring within, as opposed to between, states. That is a matter that I will come back to later on in my remarks. The idea will require a good deal of thought and development if it is to be implemented effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The UN Secretary-General has appointed Eric Suy, a former UN Legal Counsel, to lead a mission to Iraq to investigate the plight of the civilian population-in particular the Kurds. The mission, comprising four or five officials, is expected to arrive in Baghdad on 13 April, which is next week, and to remain in Iraq for seven to 10 days, during which time it will visit affected areas in both the north and the south of that country. In addition to discussing relief operations, Mr Suy will be taking up with Iraqi authorities the idea of a safe haven. Further Security Council consideration of the situation is expected to be held over until the Suy delegation has returned and made its report. Members are following the situation closely and are continuing to work on ideas for dealing with the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from this activity, as Senator Evans said on 9 April, UN Security Council resolution 687 makes specific provisions for sanctions on items other than food and arms-related trade to be maintained, subject to review every 60 days, depending on the policies and practices of the Government of Iraq. If the Iraqi Government continues its repression of the Kurds and obstructs the international community in its efforts to provide relief to the victims of that repression, the Security Council will no doubt take up the question of whether the sanctions regime might not be used to force a change in those policies. </PARA>
<PARA> On the humanitarian front, the UN Secretary-General has appealed for US$400m to support the relief activities of various international multilateral agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and so on and has appointed an executive delegate, Sadruddin Aga Khan, to coordinate the relief operation. On 10 April, Australia chaired a meeting of the UN Humanitarian Liaison Working Group in Geneva which is mapping out a coordination plan between the different relief agencies. As has been announced earlier this week, Australia is contributing $1m to this relief operation as well as providing much needed tents and blankets, which are being flown to Turkey by the Royal Australian Air Force over the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any good news in the bulletins reporting an ever increasing tide of refugees making their way to the nearest border, it is that the Iraqi Government has announced an amnesty and has apparently ceased for the moment its military attacks on civilians fleeing the country. If these reports are confirmed and the Iraqi Government does cease its repression of the Kurds, the challenge for the world community beyond the immediate need to provide food, clothing, shelter and medical treatment for these tragic victims will be to ensure the conditions which will permit them to return to their homes and pick up their lives in peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much discussion in the world, including in this place in various debates, about the UN resolutions authorising the allies to take action to liberate Kuwait. That has resulted in the jargon of `the New World Order'. Many people are sceptical about the New World Order and the fact that any move under it to achieve peace and better human rights in the world will fall apart with the first difficult situation that arises. Some people quite rightly question whether the situation of the Kurds is one in which the possibility of the New World Order will fall apart. I hope that that is not the case. But one should not dismiss the fact that, for various reasons, the problems of the Kurdish people and the difficulties in which they find themselves may not be able to be dealt with efficiently and effectively in a short period, thus enabling them to go back to live in their homes safely and securely with their human rights protected. </PARA>
<PARA> What I find interesting is that some of the people who, during much of last year and the early part of this year were very critical of the allied involvement in the war to liberate Kuwait, are now saying that we should also take action and involve ourselves directly in liberating the Kurdish people. Many of them are asking for an involvement in the internal affairs of Iraq which last year they were not willing to support in any way. Instead, when the Australian Government supported the UN resolutions which authorised such involvement, they accused it of being involved in an unwarranted interference in the affairs of that region-particularly in relation to the military aspect. I believe that it is time for the countries of the world to discuss whether it is any longer relevant to say in outright terms that the Kurdish situation is nothing more than an internal matter for the Iraqi Government to deal with; that it should be left as such; and that we should not positively or aggressively intervene in the internal affairs of Iraq to deal with the successful conclusion to the Kurdish dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> All countries of the world are in the New World Order. If we want it to work, we will have to take a more positive attitude in putting pressure not only on a country such as Iraq because of its appalling human rights record against its own population but also on many other countries. I do not make any bones about the fact that I believe it is moral and legitimate in international affairs for the rest of the world to make value judgments when people are being oppressed within a country in an appalling way such as is occurring in Iraq at the moment. I hope that such action can be taken through the UN. Though this will be a new area for the UN, I believe that it is something that cannot be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many countries in the world other than Iraq that have appalling human rights records. It would take several minutes to stand here and list the scores of countries around the world that have an appalling human rights record. Were we to ask the ordinary people in those countries whether they would favour UN intervention to remove the government and to liberate them and protect their human rights, they would welcome that intervention to give them such liberty and give them a better standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Would it not have been great for the world in the mid-1970s to have been able to intervene and to stop the genocide of Pol Pot against his own people? Would it not have been fantastic during the past 25 years had the UN been able to effectively intervene to stop the massacre of hundreds of thousands of people in various internal civil wars inside Ethiopia? Would it not have been fantastic 25 years ago had international pressure been effective in bringing to an early end the apartheid system in South Africa? Would it not have been fantastic had we been able to bring to an end much earlier the madness of the Idi Amin regime in Uganda? These are just a few examples around the world where regimes have persecuted their own people in massive violation of their human and civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that during the 1990s our country in a bipartisan nature can argue in the UN that it is time to say that the international order can intervene and make itself effective against regimes that oppress their people in such an appalling way. It will not be easy but I do not think we can afford to ignore it. The world is becoming more complex. The situation and difficulties in one part of the world affect us all. Therefore, we all have an obligation to think much more seriously about making the so-called new world order effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I note Senator Hill's remarks about meeting with a delegation of Kurds yesterday who said that they were not asking for independence but a form of autonomy within Iraq that would give them the right to follow their own religion, their own culture, their own language, and so on. I think that is quite a reasonable request. I am meeting a delegation of Kurds tomorrow who are coming to Canberra and I will be very interested to hear whether that delegation has a similar view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that in those countries where there are ethnic minorities, the only way that we can effectively deal with and give those ethnic minorities a sense of purpose and participation within the larger country is through a democratic form of government. It is overwhelmingly the case that the ethnic minorities that are oppressed are in countries that have a totalitarian form of dictatorship and where human rights are abused. Naturally, when that starts taking place those ethnic minorities will see that the only they can protect themselves from such abuse is to demand independence, whether it be the Kurds of Iraq, of Turkey or Iran; whether it be the Armenians of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; whether it be the Eritreans or the Tigreans of Ethiopia; or whether it be the Negro population of southern Sudan. The list goes on endlessly. In every one of those countries, an ethnic minority believes that the only way out of its oppression is to demand independence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine may be right about Croatia. He may be right about Slovenia, Bosnia or Montenegro in Yugoslavia. My view about many of those countries is that, because they have lived in a totalitarian regime, they are demanding independence. That is the reason that they have demanded independence. That is the only way that they can get out of the nightmare they are in. If Yugoslavia had been a proper democratic pluralistic society during the past 40 years, maybe the Croatians or the Slovenians would have had no need to argue for an independent country. If their country had been a proper democracy where they had a fair say, where they had democratically elected their representatives to a national parliament, where there was give and take and an acceptance of minority views, that country would have a better chance of survival. I think it is because a totalitarian regime, not necessarily the worst totalitarian regime in the world but certainly a one party state, existed for so long that the various ethnic groups of that country clearly felt the only way forward was to call for independence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The nub of the question about dealing with ethnic minorities is to have a democratic form of government established in the countries of the world so that human rights are protected, so that the consent of the minority is freely given to be governed, so that they know their rights are protected, and so that they have a chance to elect the government of their choice at regular, free, democratic elections. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no bones about saying that the Kurdish situation is a tragic one. The Kurds have been one of the unfortunate peoples of the twentieth century in the oppression that they have suffered. They have been caught between other more powerful groups of people in the Middle East, whether it be the old Turkish Empire, Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Iran or the Soviet Union. Hopefully, out of the mess that is now there and because of the possibilities of the new world order, at long last this may be the opportunity during this decade for the Kurdish people to at last get some freedom and autonomy, to protect their culture and to get a sense of purpose in being able to participate openly in the governments of those countries, even though they may not be able to achieve what many Kurds may want, that is, an independent country because they have been so oppressed by various dictatorial regimes. I look forward to the new world order being able to assist not only the Kurdish people but also many other minorities to get a better deal in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems obvious to me that Saddam Hussein's Iraq army feels a desperate need to prove that it can annihilate someone and the Kurds are the current victims. Not only current, of course, because Saddam Hussein has been trying to eliminate the Kurds from their ancient homeland in the north of Iraq since 1975 when he was Vice-President of Iraq and he made a deal with the Shah of Iran to assist in Iraqi persecution of the Kurds. The Kurdish people have a saying that the Kurds have no friends. The recent appalling tragic sights we have witnessed on the news broadcasts are only the latest in the long and very pitiful line of events which underline the plight of the Kurdish people. Obviously, the brutal human rights abuses committed by the Iraqi regime against the Kurds for many years are totally unacceptable by any measure of international law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 4 April I received a report from Amnesty International on what is now happening to the Kurdish people. I will just read a little of it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>In the Kurdish region, large scale massacres have apparently taken place in at least eight towns, where the streets are said to be strewn with hundreds of civilian dead, including children. </PARA>
<PARA> Hundreds of civilians have apparently also been killed after being ordered to leave their homes. Eyewitnesses from Najal also claimed to have seen 50 dead bodies of men, presumably suspected rebels, whose hands and eyes were bound, who had been shot in the back of the head. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraqi forces have reportedly taken some 10,000 Kurdish males as hostages from the area of Kirkuk, Toz Kharmato and other Kurdish cities and may be holding them in Tikrit. Torture is also alleged to have been used on the rebels. A reporter claims to have been shown a torture chamber in Kirkuk containing body parts on the walls. </PARA>
<PARA>This is obviously a systematic attempt to eliminate the Kurds from Iraq; in fact it is not the first attempt. The Kurds in Iraq have been subjected to a massive onslaught from the Iraqi army, which has indiscriminately murdered thousands of Turkish children, women and men. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, the West in particular found it convenient to support Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran while at the same time turning a blind eye to the Iraqi dictator's human rights abuses against his own people. More than four million Iraqi Kurds have suffered for more than 20 years under that dictator's regime. In the last years of the Iran-Iraq war, thousands of Kurds were massacred through the use of poison gas and chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, more than 3,000 villages in the northern part of Iraq were destroyed and thousands of people were forcibly removed to other parts of Iraq. The world took notice briefly, but apart from some token words of condemnation and a little international aid-most of which did not reach the Kurds-little was done. Meanwhile, the international community continued to support the Iraqi regime by selling as many weapons of destruction as possible to the brutal dictator. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade in military arms without proper monitoring was bound to lead to a situation where insane tyrants, such as Saddam Hussein, could use their military equipment for aggressive and territorial expansion, such as the Kuwaiti invasion, as well as use tools of destruction against their own people. The irony now is that, even though the United States and its allies may have won the war against Iraq, we are well and truly in danger of losing the peace which we hoped to gain. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest resolution from the United Nations Security Council does not augur well in this regard. As the motion which we are discussing tonight correctly points out, the Security Council resolution fails to include any provision mentioning how the Kurds' plight would be addressed. This is a glaring omission. The Australian Democrats would like to see the maintenance of economic sanctions against Iraq until the Iraqi regime ceases not only its war against the Kurds but also all human rights abuses. In fact, we had some encouragement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) earlier this week in an answer to a question I asked of him. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the United Nations organised sanctions against Iraq should continue until the appalling campaign of terror aimed at the Kurds stops. Sadly, the international community is once again in danger of letting the Kurdish people down. Already we are seeing the switch from a policy of calculated aggression in the Gulf to one which the Guardian Weekly termed `a policy of calculated inertia'. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the chief proponent of this inertia is now the United States Government, which seems intent on doing as little as possible. What a paradox it now is to witness the United States arguing for a minimalist interpretation of United Nations resolutions when for so long during the Gulf War it found it convenient to take as broad a definition as possible of what the United Nations had supposedly authorised. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the `new world order' mean to the Kurdish people, encouraged to rise up against the Iraqi Government and now abandoned by the international community and left to die of hunger and cold in the mountains on the Iraqi-Turkish border? Massed in some of the wildest country on earth are 600,000 Kurdish Iraqi refugees. In the Hobart Mercury today Bruce Wilson wrote that they are:</PARA>
<PARA> In the open, perched like mountain goats on the slopes, dying in hundreds, giving birth, freezing at night, eating trees and roots. </PARA>
<PARA>The more we witness what is happening to the Kurds, the more difficult it is to believe that there is peace there and, even more so, that justice has been brought to that region of the world. The world is faced with a very clear choice. The international community can either accept the status quo of the situation, as most of the world prefers to do, or it can actively and positively deliver a solution that finally and comprehensively delivers a just peace to this whole region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats point out that there is an inconsistency in logic in bombing Iraq almost continuously in a 40-day war and then ending up with a policy which argues against intervention in the internal affairs of another country. At the very least, for instance, the destruction of Iraqi helicopters, which were used against the Kurds, should have been undertaken as part of the cease-fire agreement. Ultimately, however, as the Democrats have argued, a just peace in the region will only come when the international community recognises and works towards a comprehensive Middle East settlement, including the establishment of a separate and independent state of Kurdistan. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this is where the plan of British Prime Minister John Major falls down. It fails to go far enough. We believe that the establishment of an autonomous Kurdish state is probably the only way of stopping the many decades of entrenched brutality against the Kurds. Surely, self-determination for the Kurds is their right under the International Bill of Human Rights, which states in article 1:</PARA>
<PARA>All peoples have the right of self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA>If the United Nations fails to act on this issue now, history will undoubtedly record 1991 as the second spectacular international betrayal of the Kurds. The first, of course, occurred just after the First World War. The irony is that the Kurdish people were dealt their cruelest blow in another post-war period when they were promised a separate Kurdish State in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres. But Sevres was rejected by the Turkish Nationalist leader Kemal Ataturk, as were the agreements recognising Kurdish rights, agreements which were subsequently overtaken by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the world conveniently chose to forget commitments and promises. It sacrificed the Kurdish homeland to appease Turkey. The provinces of Mosul and Kirkuk, which should have formed part of the State of Kurdistan, were instead annexed, together with their oil wealth, by Britain in 1925 and given to the newly created arab state of Iraq. For the Kurds, this was a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the First World War, they were split between the Ottoman and Persian empires. After 1925, they found themselves split between five states: Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Soviet Union. In truth, despite the atrocities committed by the Iraqis in recent weeks, not one of these five nations mentioned has a record it can be proud of when it comes to the Kurds. At best, the Kurds are discriminated against; at worst they are repressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union's record of repression of minorities is well known and quite appalling. Syria is a military dictatorship which allows no dissent. In Iran, although the Kurds do have some cultural rights, their attempts to win autonomy after the 1979 revolution were brutally crushed by Iran's revolutionary guard. In Turkey, the Kurds are not officially recognised as a distinct ethnic group, but instead are called `mountain Turks'. The repression of the Kurdish language and culture in Turkey is a matter of fact. It is a crime in Turkey to speak Kurdish. We now witness the dreadful behaviour of Turkish soldiers at the border with Iraq. They have been pushing the Kurdish refugees back into Iraq, sometimes using rifles. In many ways, therefore, it is understandable that the creation of a Kurdish state has been opposed by all these countries at various times over the last 70 years and still is opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The international community has always been faint-hearted on the question of an autonomous Kurdish state. It would be tragic indeed if the world remained inactive on this question any longer. It is time to act right now and to do so in a decisive manner. The Democrats believe that Australia should actively support the legitimate rights of the Kurdish people and seize the opportunity in the United Nations to argue the case for the establishment of an autonomous Kurdish state. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kurds have modest aims. Today their leaders aspire to autonomy within Iraq-not a separate state of their own. Given the way in which the world has treated the Kurds over the last 70 years, to do less than that is to once again ignore our moral responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that this motion is put forward with proper outrage at what is happening in Iraq to the Kurds. Certainly the first plank of this motion must be supported by everybody. The first plank of the motion reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the appalling abuse of the Kurds in Iraq by Saddam Hussein and his military. </PARA>
<PARA>As we all look at the television and see the most harrowing scenes, which have been well described by the speakers who have gone before me, we all must be moved to the most profound pity. Unfortunately, I think we are all moved to the most profound frustration. The notice of motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the United Nations Security Council resolution on the ceasefire did not include provisions to protect minorities in Iraq;</PARA>
<PARA>That is so. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) regrets that the Australian Government failed to lobby for the inclusion of such provisions;</PARA>
<PARA>There is in that plank of the motion an implicit, if not explicit, condemnation of what the Government has failed to do. If it was proper and in place for the Australian Government to lobby for the inclusion of such a provision, which would have assisted and even saved the Kurds, if it was within the Australian Government's ability to do that and it did not do it, then the Government should rightly be condemned. Any government that stands aside and fails to do something which would have saved any of the Kurds who made that awful trek that we saw on television, any government that failed to lobby properly, deserves to be condemned. But when one goes further and asks what were the provisions that the Australians should have lobbied for to do what we all want to do-that is, to save as many of the Kurds as possible-when we ask what the Australian Government should have specifically asked for, it does not appear in this motion. I do not point that out in any way to take away from the proper intent of Senator Hill in bringing forth this motion; I point it out to show that it is very difficult indeed off the cuff, as it were, to set up some procedure which would bring peace and proper justice to the Kurds. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bourne has faced that and said that we should set up a state of Kurdistan. She would get over the problem by setting up an autonomous state within the general jurisdiction of the Iraqi Government. It seems to me that when one pronounces on that and simply states that as what is wanted, one sees the futility of taking such a step. Will Saddam Hussein peacefully allow a Kurdistan state to be taken out of Iraq? If so, will Turkey, Iran and Syria allow the same thing to happen? That is what must happen if what is sought by the Australian Democrats occurs. Senator Hill says that perhaps more could have been done, but is unable to specify what. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a good motion in a couple of respects. First, it points out that we should properly take note of and, more than that, feel deeply for the plight of the Kurdish people in Iraq. It also illustrates by its very terms the great difficulty for a country like Australia to do sufficient to enable the Kurdish people to somehow be brought back into a decent place in which to live and enjoy their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has contributed aid, and there seems to be no condemnation or cavil on the part of the Opposition or the Australian Democrats with the action taken by the Government in that respect. It may have been a better avenue of attack by the Opposition, if that is what it wanted to do, to say that the Government has not given enough and that it should have given more aid to the Kurds than it has. But that seems not to be the thrust of what the Opposition is saying in this motion. The thrust of the motion seems to be that there should have been some unspecified provisions put into the United Nations Security Council resolution to protect minorities in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have been more specific than that. They have said that there should be an autonomous state in Iraq. I am not sure whether they would include parts of Iran, Turkey and Syria, but that seems to be the thrust of what they say. I simply say that that, unfortunately, is a solution which, although motivated by the best of intentions, is doomed to failure, unless we want to start another war not only with Saddam Hussein but also with the countries surrounding the Kurds. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to events that took place in Melbourne at the weekend, and I understand that similar events took place elsewhere in Australia during the same weekend. First, I want to talk about a demonstration by Kurds in Melbourne which started off at the General Post Office and ended in the City Square. It was conducted by the Kurdish Association of Victoria, which was ably represented by such people as Mr Muslim Kocamis. The Association put out a circular which is not long and which I intend to read. It gives a flavour of how the Kurdish people in Australia think and it gives an idea of their outrage and frustrations as to what has happened in the land where their forebears lived. The document, headed `Democracy and Human Rights in Kurdistan', reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Kurds are the only nation in the world with a population of approximately 30 million who have repeatedly been denied a state. Kurdistan is occupied by Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey where they are forbidden to practise their culture, speak Kurdish, and to have their own schools amongst many other. Depending on which part of Kurdistan the Kurds are, they are Persians, Arabs or Turks, but to cover their racism from the international arena they then define the Kurdish people as either people from Iraq, Iran, Syria or as from Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA>In Kurdistan, a monstrous crime is perpetrated.</PARA>
<PARA>South Kurdistan under the occupation of Iraq has been subjected to the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime once again. The most recent genocide in August 1988 was the use of chemical weapons against the Kurdish people where thousands of villages were also wiped off the map. </PARA>
<PARA>The Kurdish people are being slaughtered by Saddam and his army. Tens of thousands of people perish trapped between the Turkish army and Hussein's army. The Kurds have been forced to flee their villages and towns (which have been totally destroyed by the Iraqi army) to the Turkish and Iranian borders. However both Iran and Turkey have again closed their borders after the acceptance of a small number of women and children. Two million women, children, and men are waiting in freezing temperatures without adequate clothing, lack of food, shelter and proper medical attention for the sick and the wounded. </PARA>
<PARA>Iraq has not only bombarded the Kurdish people via the helicopters they have also used Napalm bombs. The genocide against the Kurdish people still continues. </PARA>
<PARA>Why don't the United States and allies intervene? It was said they went to liberate Kuwait in the name of Democracy and Humanity. But now they say they have no authority to intervene in Iraq's internal affairs. Who then economically and militarily supported the people in Nicaragua and Afghanistan? Everybody knows that international law and the U.N. charter were bent to free Kuwait. Why then this sudden excess of legalism, these wise thoughts about the undesirability of a divided Iraq? Saddam Hussein has no more right to Kurdistan than he had to Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>The Kurds are not rebels, they are called ``peshmergas'' who are freedom fighters fighting for a free Kurdistan. </PARA>
<PARA>We, the Kurdish Community in Australia, would like to call upon the Australian Government, the media, democratic and humanitarian organisations and individuals, Christians, Moslems, Buddhists, Jews and all the other believers and non-believers, who believe in democracy and humanity to support the Kurdish struggle. </PARA>
<PARA>This can be done by:</PARA>
<PARA> - Putting pressure on United Nations to resolve the Kurdish question, in the meantime sending a peace keeping force to stop the genocide,</PARA>
<PARA> - To publicly support the Kurdish people's right to self determination,</PARA>
<PARA> - Condemning Saddam Hussein who is the wretched of the earth. </PARA>
<PARA> - Donations via Care Australia Campaign Kurdish Appeal at any Commonwealth Bank branch Account No: 2919930237. </PARA>
<PARA>PLEASE ASSIST</PARA>
<PARA>Then there is an address at the bottom. The other meeting was held on the Sunday by the Turkish Community Resource Centre Human Rights Committee, the secretary of which is a Ms Sevinc Sezen. The circular issued as a result of that meeting reads, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Every human being is entitled to all rights and freedoms set forth in the International Bill of Rights, without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, language or political opinion. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet every day in country after country these rights are being violated. </PARA>
<PARA>The circular then talks about the location of the Centre's next meeting. That quote from this circular sums up what we should concentrate upon. Until we stop seeing people as Palestinians, Israelis, Kurds, Kuwaitis, or El Salvadoreans and start seeing them as human beings and fellow dwellers on this planet, neighbours and brothers and sisters, which is the teaching of all the great religions, we will probably hear in this chamber, year after year, the same sorts of speeches as we have heard tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to and been present during the whole of this debate. I feel that there is a degree of unanimity right around the chamber about most issues relating to this debate. Firstly, there is strong condemnation of the action taken by Saddam Hussein and his army in their persecution of the Kurdish minority. The ruthlessness of that persecution is absolutely appalling. There is no need for me to reiterate what has already been stated quite adequately and competently by each of the speakers tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is some difference of opinion on whether there was some failure to lobby for the inclusion of provisions in the United Nations Security Council resolution on the cease-fire to protect minorities in Iraq. That is what the debate boils down to. There is also agreement around the chamber that the tragic situation being experienced by the Kurdish people is the result of a number of factors including the Gulf war, the action taken by the coalition forces in pursuance of United Nations (UN) decisions, and the perception by the Kurds that the coalition forces would not oppose but welcome their uprising. In those circumstances the UN Security Council should have included in its resolution some form of protection for the Kurds against the onslaughts by Saddam Hussein. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is it? Well, about four weeks ago I asked a question of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) about the action of the coalition forces in bombing a retreating force of Iraqis along a 90-kilometre stretch of roadway. I asked a number of questions: whether that was legitimate and whether it was militarily nugatory. I have received a written response from the Minister, which does not take his original answer much further. But I might say this to that interjection: I wondered why that column could not have been put in a position of surrender at the northern end of that road and disarmed?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What military equipment is being used in the onslaught by Saddam Hussein against the Kurds? It is that sort of military equipment that is being used. Why were more prisoners of war not taken? Had they been, they would not have been able to be used by Saddam Hussein in the onslaught against the Kurds, and some arrangement surely could have been made for the protection of the Kurds. I am inclined to support the motion proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the amount of $1m being put forward by the Government is chickenfeed in a circumstance which is facing us here and now, particularly as we expended a large sum of money in support of the coalition effort in the Gulf. Instead of frittering away moneys on the type of trendy population control projects that are still very hazy-and we still have not received information on where the $5.1m is going-what about some of that money being used to assist in this tragic situation to feed the starving and to clothe those who face the freezing temperatures in northern Iraq?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cooney" NAMEID="SF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I read the motion, it deplores the appalling abuse. Yes, it is true that it does not, but I assume from what Senator Hill said that he is in favour of action being taken by the Government along those lines. I think that Senator Schacht made it clear that he is in favour as well. But Senator Cooney is right in saying that there is nothing in the motion that says it. But I assume that it is the general view around the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not my intention to repeat what has been said today. But it just seems that whilst we have a tremendous degree of unanimity around the chamber about this most important subject, there is just that small difference between us. On balance, I would have liked to see our Government, with all the information at its disposal, lobby for the inclusion in the United Nations Security Council resolution on the actual cease-fire for a provision to protect minorities in Iraq. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I doubt whether the Senate will debate, during the whole of 1991, an issue more tragic in its ramifications than the plight of the Kurds. The Kurdish people have suffered greatly, not only in an immediate sense but over generations. They have suffered very greatly during the period that Saddam Hussein has occupied the presidency of Iraq.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is wise to look at the issue in the context of the war in the Gulf. That war, of course, was provoked by the aggression of the Iraqi regime, by its occupation of its peaceful neighbour Kuwait and by the subsequent pillage and rape that took place there. When that war commenced a number of public figures and a great many commentators drew attention again to the plight of the Kurdish people and made reference to the horrific way in which the Government of Iraq had treated them. Certainly since the armistice agreement had been signed with Iran, the Iraqi regime had treated its Kurdish citizens with the utmost brutality and ferocity. The Iraqis had used technologies available to them to bring about some truly terrifying developments and I refer, of course, to the open use of chemical weapons against Kurdish villages in the north of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great pity that more attention was not paid to those appalling incidents at the time when they first occurred. But nonetheless, the war in the Gulf did serve to bring the plight of the Kurdish people into focus. Perhaps for the very first time the plight of the Kurds became a truly international issue with international ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to look at a very brief chronology of recent events by way of examining the backdrop to the revolt that has taken place not only in the northern part of Iraq but in Iraq generally. It was only on 2 March that the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 686 requiring the Iraqi regime to accept all the previous resolutions of the United Nations and to rescind its purported annexation of Kuwait. The meeting the next day of coalition commanders and Iraqi commanders did agree upon the implementation of an informal cease-fire. </PARA>
<PARA> That is useful to know because it was only 24 hours later that reports began to be received in the region's media, particularly in Iran and then in the western media, of a deteriorating security situation in that part of Iraq which is inhabited largely by Shi'ite citizens. That resulted in the city of Basra falling within a very short time to rebel forces. A few days later, reports surfaced of unrest in the northern part of Iraq in the Kurdish centres. </PARA>
<PARA> For the following two weeks, the Iraqi military-and I commend Senator Bourne for her remarks about the Iraqi military-displayed an exemplary capacity for failure when fighting other military forces but displayed an exemplary capacity for brutality and bravado when fighting largely unarmed civilian populations. The Iraqi military concentrated on quelling the rebellion in the southern part of the country, including the recovery of the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala-holy to the religion of Islam. Then, with the south largely suppressed, the Iraqi military could turn its attention upon the Kurdish people and use the same capacities in repression that it had applied in the cities of Basra, Najaf and Karbala. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was drawing together a short chronology of recent events as a background to the revolt in Iraq. Between 10 and 28 March 1991, the Kurdish people made very significant gains, occupying many of the major centres in the region, including the major oil town of Kirkuk. By 28 March Kurdish rebels had effectively wrested control of an Iraqi air base south of the city and were preparing for a counterattack. However, within two days, fortified by its successful military intervention against its own civilian population, the Iraqi army began arraying its firepower against the Kurdish people in the northern region of the country and by use of artillery, helicopter gunships and other heavy weapons, virtually all of the Kurdish-held towns and centres fell to the advancing Iraqi military. Of course, it is a matter of terrible history that the recovery of that part of the country was accompanied by brutality on a massive scale, including widespread executions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a dramatic failure in the language of diplomacy. That precipitated the intervention by the Iraqi military against its own people, and that has resulted in the flow of refugees to Iran, Turkey and Syria. The failure of the language of diplomacy has had direct consequences on the tragedy that we have seen over the last week or so. Of course, I am referring to the statements made by the United States President, George Bush, calling upon the people of Iraq to rise up against their own Government in the expectation that sections of the Iraqi military would depose Saddam Hussein.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of course, flies in the face of virtually all we know about the nature of the Baathist regime in Iraq which has assumed, during the decade of the 1980s, through purges and murders, all the trappings of a monolithic, political and military structure. That was witnessed during the long period of the war against the Islamic Republic of Iran, it was reinforced during the time of the Gulf war and it is being seen graphically demonstrated again. The dictatorship of Saddam Hussein has remained secure. Hopefully that may change.</PARA>
<PARA> Saddam boasted that when the allied coalition began its war of liberation in Kuwait it would mean the mother of all battles. That, of course, was nothing other than rhetorical nonsense, but one thing we can say about Saddam Hussein is that he is the father of all murderers in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the plight of the Kurdish people represents the first test of the new world order to which this Parliament is committed. There is no doubt that it affords an additional sense of immediacy to all the endeavours by Australia and other like-minded countries to see the United Nations (UN) intervene more effectively and more forcefully in these types of appalling situations.</PARA>
<PARA> It gives an additional sense of immediacy to the calls that have been made for the creation of an international peacekeeping force under UN auspices. I hope that that is one of the recommendations that will emerge from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which has been looking directly at the question of Australia's involvement in UN peacekeeping operations.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is entirely fair to say that the Australian Government has been forthright in terms of its condemnation of Iraq's behaviour. It has been forthright in its defence of the interests of the Kurdish people both in terms of international forums and in terms of talking directly with delegations from Australian Kurds. A delegation met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) very recently.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that, like a number of senators from all the parties in the Parliament, people received yesterday or today an urgent facsimile transmission from the Kurdish Victorian Association detailing the slaughter of the Kurdish people that is occurring as we speak here in the Senate tonight. The facsimile also outlines what the people of Kurdistan would like to see occur. I must say that in very large measure the demands are more than reason- able, especially given the awful slaughter that has occurred and which continues to occur.</PARA>
<PARA> In that light it has been a very important development that within the last 24 hours the United States of America has detailed an aerial exclusion zone in the north of Iraq which will afford the refugees some measure of protection from marauding Iraqi helicopters. It is true that hindsight is always 20 : 20 vision. It is true that no less an authority than General Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, has said that given the time again the coalition would have insisted that all Iraqi helicopters along with fixed wing aircraft should have been grounded. It is a lesson that needs to be learned for the future not only by the countries in the coalition but also by those committed to peaceful settlements and solutions everywhere. Dealing with dictatorships of the nature and structure of Saddam Hussein's regime means that it is absolutely necessary to exercise extreme care in terms of the detail of agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the Kurdish Australian people, they are asking simply for the safe return of people to their homes, for support for people's rights to live in peace, for UN peacekeeping forces to be present and for urgent humanitarian assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I was impressed not only by the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the House of Representatives a matter of a day or so ago on the Australian Government's action in terms of providing humanitarian assistance, but also by the immediate response of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, in support of that initiative. That means that the effective breaking down of the bipartisanship as represented by Senator Hill's motion is all the more regrettable. I have said in this Senate before that in my view issues such as foreign affairs, defence and trade ought to be largely above partisan considerations. That is why I think that point scoring is unfortunate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say, in answer to Senator Crichton-Browne whose interjections I always enjoy, that it is a two-way process-there is no doubt about that. I draw attention to a statement made at a press conference a day or so ago by Senator Evans, in which the Australian Government welcomed the initiative of the British Prime Minister, Mr Major, for the concept of a safe haven in Iraq-something which has been endorsed by the European Community and now given effect by the announcement of the United States Government that the United States Air Force would guarantee the safe haven against the Iraqi air force. This is a new development in international affairs. It has come a little too late on this occasion, but it is a very useful step for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The plight of the Kurds affects us all. The response of this Parliament is very important. It is unfortunate that the degree of bipartisanship we have shown on these issues has broken down on this occasion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating a motion by Senator Hill deploring the appalling abuse of the Kurds in Iraq by Saddam Hussein and his military. I do not think anyone would have any argument with the matters raised in the first part of the resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the resolution goes on to note that the United Nations (UN) Security Council resolution on the ceasefire did not include provision to protect the minorities in Iraq. I think most members of this Parliament would know that the Security Council certainly did not take into consideration what might happen following the end of hostilities in Iraq and Kuwait. Probably at some time in the future, if we talk about the new order, the United Nations should start to take note of what might happen, and take into consideration the end of hostilities and what action should be taken to resolve the position of the Kurdish people or minorities in relation to those conflicts. </PARA>

<PARA> That the resolution of the Senate of 31 May 1990 relating to the broadcasting by television stations of Senate proceedings be modified by omitting condition 6 in paragraph (3), which prohibits the broadcasting of the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that that is really an issue of burning importance that should keep us here until 3 o'clock tomorrow morning. I suggest to the mover of the resolution that she be kind enough to amend her motion. Perhaps the one that is of burning interest-the one relating to the Kurdish situation-should suffice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-There is absolutely no doubt that the motion relating to the plight of the Kurdish community is of overwhelming importance and must be dealt with by the Senate tonight. We have been most diligent in putting up only one speaker-Senator Hill-because it was our view that the motion should be passed. The Australian Democrats likewise had only one speaker-Senator Bourne. I know for a fact that other Democrats would very much like to have spoken, as would I, Senator Teague and many other Opposition senators. We have been faced with the situation where the Government has had Senator Schacht speak for what I thought was 30 minutes, although he said it was 25; I would have to say that it seemed like 30. Senator Loosely has spoken for 30 minutes so far; Senator Cooney spoke for 15 minutes; and Senator Jones is just two minutes into what will obviously be a riveting speech on the same topic. That presumably means that about another 26 senators on the Australian Labor Party side are prepared to keep us here until morning. If need be, that is the way it will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the motion relating to the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust is concerned, we intended that our speaker, Senator Michael Baume, would speak for probably no more than five minutes merely to put the situation on the record. The Australian Democrats, as I understand it, were going to do likewise. I do not know what the Government's intentions were. Although Senator Vanstone would like to explain the third motion, she has no burning desire to do so and is happy for it merely to be put to a vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I want to respond briefly to the remarks that indicate in some way that the Government has acted improperly by debating a very important issue before the Parliament. The fact of the matter is that this is a very important issue. As Senator Cooney said, 30 or 40 senators quite properly came in to speak on the very important issue of the war. We now have the important issue of the Kurds, a human tragedy, and we are asked not to speak on it, but to allow it to go through so that a resolution that the Opposition wishes to carry criticising the Government can be put on the record and for no other purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate is a very important chamber in which people are entitled to express their views about important issues. Procedurally, not one person spoke to me or to the Whips about this arrangement and that is why we did not get any agreement on it. We are quite relaxed about debating it. We are not saying that we will not debate it; I am simply saying that we will not stand here and take lightly criticism that we have done something inappropriate by debating an issue that deserves to be debated. We quite properly and appropriately will continue to debate this until everybody has said what he or she wishes to say on the matter and contributions on this and on the other two matters have been concluded. </PARA>

My time certainly did not run out. I have to say that no indication was given to me that there was an informal time limit on any speakers in the debate and, as I was the first speaker on the Government side, I thought it was only reasonable that I put the information from the Government's perspective on a very important issue dealing with the Kurdish situation. As I say, I was given no indication that there was an informal arrangement that we were all limited to 5, 10, 15 or 20 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, really? I think that past practice will demonstrate that, in procedural matters and arrangements of courtesy on both sides of the House, I am as amenable as anybody in this chamber. I think that is a matter of fact. I have just discovered, from a conversation with a Democrat, that I need to correct the record in here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Reid has delivered a load of rubbish in her contribution to this motion this afternoon that needs to be corrected. It has already been corrected by Senator McMullan and, indeed, by Senator Schacht. Let me say that we all know these arrangements; they are made constantly, and properly, in here. Allusions have been made to arrangements being made to limit speeches-arrangements being made for one speaker a side. No arrangements were made with me-none. I was not spoken to. The Whip has just confirmed that Senator Reid's assertions about bad practice on our part and trying to avoid votes are also untrue so far as he is concerned. No arrangements were made with him as the Whip, nor with the duty Minister. I would like to know whom they were made with. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of reasonable practice and reasonable behaviour in this chamber, and a little bit of courtesy on both sides, which does help us all through the day every now and again, I thought it would have been reasonable. I could see all the machinations going on around the chamber. It was not up to me to be as rude as others were, to go and stand over the Democrats while other people were talking with them. I did not know what was going on. I would have thought it would have been courteous. </PARA>
<PARA> I have now been informed by a senator that a suggestion was made that it would have been reasonable to speak to the Government briefly, and the Opposition indicated that it was not its intention to do so. It is a bit rough, I would say in fairness, when the Opposition has quite happily indicated to the Democrats that, as far as it was concerned, this was going to be an ambush. That is fine-ambushes are okay-but the Opposition then claims that somehow or other we have behaved improperly, or badly, in not limiting speeches, whereas I can say, as the person in the chamber at the time, that we were not asked to do so. I had no idea that not only was this debate to go on, but that two other motions were also to be moved in General Business, because no-one had the courtesy to tell me. I am not suggesting that people have to but, if they want the courtesy extended, that is a two-way street. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest that the normal arrangements should prevail, that is, to have a one-minute chat to whoever happens to be the duty Minister in the House and to at least have a talk to the Whip to institute those arrangements that Senator Reid referred to-limiting speakers on each side, and so on. None of our speakers knew. In fact, in terms of conversations, out of courtesy I actually walked across and told the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) that Senator Loosley wanted to speak in this debate. Silly old me, not realising there was going to be an ambush, I tried to prevail upon Senator Loosley not to speak. I will tell the Senate why-pure self-interest! I have to get up at five o'clock to go and catch a plane that leaves at 6.30. I actually wanted to go home. Terrible, is it not? Senator Loosley had actually prepared a speech-16 points, all typed out. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator McMullan has already alluded to, Senator Loosley actually wanted to make a contribution to this debate, as he does to a great many debates, because he felt strongly about it. I said, `Okay Steve, this is a House of debate; if you want to talk, talk'. It is just nonsense. Senator Loosely had no idea that some arrangements had been made to limit speakers, neither did Senator Schacht nor any other speaker on this side. </PARA>
<PARA> The point needs to be made-I did have a fairly civilised conversation with Senator McLean, as the Whip, about this-that in future if assertions are to be made and accusations are to be made, as they just were, about bad practice on this side of the House, it might be better to make them on a little more solid ground. The solid ground that Opposition members would need next time is to at least have had the courtesy of a 30-second conversation with either the duty Minister or the Whip before they start accusing us of bad practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Can I make it clear that I was no part of any arrangement on how this matter was to be discussed. I did not take Senator Reid to be suggesting what is being discussed. I think that she was suggesting that there was an understanding on her part that this would be disposed of tonight because it was a very important motion, which it is. In my speech-I think that everybody agreed with me-I said that it was a proper thing for Senator Hill to raise and I thought that everybody made great contributions, and may I pay tribute to Senator Harradine who also had no idea that there was some understanding amongst some people here that there may have been a limit to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take it that Senator Reid was not suggesting that. She was suggesting that it was an important matter that should be disposed of tonight. Perhaps the words that she used were capable of a construction that she did not intend. I simply put it that way because it seems to me a great shame that a very important debate about a most tragic issue should end up in the way it seems to be ending up where we are in fundamental agreement about the terrible plight of the Kurds but somehow the whole debate has taken a tone that nobody really intended. I ask Senator Reid, the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine to accept it from me that I certainly did not have any intention of acting other than in a proper way, and I am sure that those on this side who debated the motion did not. I am absolutely sure that Senator Harradine is of the same mind and perhaps we could get on with the matter. I did say to Senator McMullan, as he has very properly said, that it seemed to me that this was a crucial debate and, given the time we spent on a proper debate on the Gulf war, we could have spent a bit longer on this one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Senator Cooney is the one person who has it right and understands the situation. The difference between the sort of debate that Senator Collins is talking about and the debate tonight is that we are talking in General Business, which is restricted to 2 1/2 hours and which tonight would have ended at 10.50 p.m. The only comment that I made to the Government Whip about it was to tell him that the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) was speaking briefly. I asked him how long Senator Schacht would speak and he said about half an hour. I said, `If he does, we will be running into trouble'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole point of the matter is that this debate is restricted to 2 1/2 hours. It is Opposition business time and we are entitled to that time to get our business done. If the Government wants all of its 30 senators-or however many it has-to talk on this debate, it is a matter that ought to be brought on as Government business when everybody can talk. That is the complete difference between this and the debate in January that has been referred to. It is quite different. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the division, I was going through the clauses of the motion moved by Senator Hill. I dealt with clause (b) and I was coming to clause (c), which I will come back to in a moment. Clause (d) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(d) urges the UN Security Council to take such action as is necessary to end this human tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anyone would have any argument with seeking some sort of action from the United Nations Security Council. Clause (c) claims that the Government has failed to lobby for the inclusion of provisions. As Senator Hill will be well aware, the Government will not agree to that clause. I am not sure that I am in order, but I would like to move an amendment to remove clause (c) from the motion. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Omit paragraph (c). </PARA>
<PARA>One of the other points I would like to make before I talk about the Kurds is that it is fairly important to remember that tonight a number of speakers from the Government spoke on the issue of the Kurds and the problems that they have. I think it is reasonable to say that a large number of senators in this Senate spoke in the debate on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, including Government and Opposition members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kurdish problem at the moment is a result of the conflict in the Middle East. I think what we are discussing tonight is just as important an issue. I note that the Opposition has had only one speaker. Members of the Government have shown that they certainly have some interest in the fact that the Kurdish people are suffering from the problems of being isolated in the north of Iraq by Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> Just let me go back for a moment and deal with the United Nations (UN) and the new order. A number of speakers tonight have mentioned the new order. It is quite obvious that some people do not believe that the new order will work. In attending the United Nations, I was impressed by the number of nations, including the Soviet Union, the United States of America and European countries, and to a lesser degree China, where changes have taken place. They had a view of cooperation with one another. I believe that it was that view of cooperation that permitted the Security Council to carry the resolution that allowed the coming together of a force to go to the Middle East to deal with Saddam Hussein and the problems in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> If it had not been for the so-called new order and the special cooperation that had developed between the countries of the United Nations, I do not believe that the Security Council would have taken the action it did and carried the resolution that allowed a coalition force to go to the Middle East to remove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have to say that taking that action and moving Saddam Hussein and his forces out of Kuwait created the problem of the Kurdish people. It is because of the creation of that problem that we now find ourselves debating the question in this House. I believe that anyone who watched television tonight and last night would have been shocked at the way in which the Kurdish people were suffering in the cold in the northern part of Iraq. It would appear that because of the treatment of those people and the way in which they were suffering and the number of refugees who will come out of that area the international community has to stand up and say something, to see that there is some end to the problems in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if the international community applies pressure on the United Nations about what is happening to the Kurdish people, the UN will have to rethink what it is doing in relation to moving into countries where there is an internal problem. I do not believe that the United Nations-if it is talking about a new order-can sit back for a long period and allow the situation that is developing in Iraq with the Kurdish people to continue. The United Nations has to change its charter to allow it to move into that area and it needs to do it fairly quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that happened is that the United Nations believed it was acting in relation to the new order that had developed. It passed the resolution that allowed the coalition forces to move into Kuwait, but it did not think about what might happen beyond the end of the war. We should take note of what was said in today's press by James Bone in New York. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>United Nations forces have been embroiled in a variety of wars and communal conflicts around the world, but the organisation has never sent military personnel to establish a safe haven in a country's territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Often, as in Cyprus or Lebanon, it is difficult to say that such involvement does not amount to interference in a country's internal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The UN Charter allows such intervention only when it is necessary as part of enforcement action to maintain international peace. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the United Nations should look at its charter, which spells out that it should not interfere in a country's internal territory. Some action should be taken to see that in the future the United Nations, under the new order, ensures that people are not dislocated because of war, as the Kurdish people have been because of the conflict in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was at the United Nations I viewed the tapes that were shown to the Security Council of the atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein in Kuwait. They left me with no doubt that the action that was taken by the United Nations to move into Kuwait and remove Saddam Hussein was correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that the one mistake made by the United Nations was that it did not stop to consider what might happen after the conflict finished. I believe that it is important that in future it should consider that. Mr Shevardnadze, then the Soviet Foreign Minister, said very clearly that steps should be taken to reinstitute the military committee of the United Nations. If that had been done, maybe the military committee would have given different advice to the United Nations when it drew up the conditions of surrender for Iraq. It might have drawn up conditions that would have taken into consideration what might happen to minority groups in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is very important that members of this House, particularly members of the Government-and for that matter, I know that the Opposition has not spoken on this matter, except for the Leader of the Opposition in this place-if they are really interested in the Kuwaiti issue and what has happened in the Middle East, if they are really interested in what is happening to the Kurds, should get to their feet and say something about the matter so that some pressure is put on the international community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the important issue of the Kurds. I am surprised that more Opposition members have decided not to participate in the debate. It is an issue that we all have to be most concerned about. It is an issue that deals with the civil rights and human rights of the Kurds who live in Iraq. Australia did protest, and has a history of protesting, at the actions of Saddam Hussein in 1988 when he used chemical and gas warfare against the Kurdish civilians. We saw graphic pictures then, and Australia certainly was one of the first countries to express its condemnation at that outrage. We moved quickly to provide an expert to the United Nations investigation of the tragic incidents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been active, as I have said, in international forums, particularly in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in highlighting Iraq's human rights record. It is a record that goes back over a decade. At the Commission this year, for instance, we sponsored a resolution supporting a special rapporteur to examine the human rights situation in Iraq. The United Nations Security Council resolution which was established on the cease-fire in the Gulf war was resolution 687. That was adopted on 2 April. It was a very complex resolution adopted by the Security Council because, as the Senate will recall, there were members of the Security Council who had reservations about its extent. It was the most intrusive in the sense of imposing international supervision of Iraq's disarmament program and of its reparation payments for damage caused in Kuwait. Prior to its adoption, the resolution had been negotiated for more than two weeks-in the first instance among the five permanent members of the Security Council, and then between those members and the other members of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> When the resolution was first drafted and throughout much of the negotiating period, the situation in Iraq was unclear. Kurdish rebels had captured several cities in the north and the Shia rebels were making progress in the south. In this situation no-one knew whether Saddam's government would survive or not. It was in that situation that the resolution was adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> By the time it became clear that the Iraqi forces were winning the war against the Kurds and that the flow of refugees had commenced, resolution 687 was in the final stages of negotiation. It was a bit difficult then to pull it back and renegotiate. What happened, at France's suggestion, was that the question of the Kurds was dealt with within a separate resolution, resolution 688. That focuses international attention specifically on the repression of Iraqi civilians by the Iraqi armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the period of the negotiation of both resolutions, the Australian mission in New York has been in close touch with the principals. Both there and in the capitals we have exchanged ideas on the developing text. Australia is not a member of the Security Council and does not have any direct input into the Council's deliberations. However, we have been an active participant in assisting to formulate the resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to know that Australia has had a major role in looking at this. We have promised aid. We only have to look at some of the recent very graphic television footage coming into our homes nightly to see what atrocities are being committed and what hardships the Kurds are having to exist under. Some are not existing. We do not know how many Kurds have been killed or have died in this last conflict. It is a situation that we have to redress and it is something this Australian Government is doing; that is very important. It is very important to make people aware that Australia has been an active participant in trying to resolve the problem and also in trying to provide the aid and succour that is necessary to these people who are suffering greatly under this hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a new occasion for the Kurds. They have suffered frequently at the hands of many groups, but I think this would be one of the worst atrocities that they have ever experienced. On that note, I think it is important to support the Government's efforts in attempting to solve this problem, in attempting to assist in the easing of the trauma, the suffering and the hardship that the Kurds have had inflicted upon them by the Iraqi Government and army, but not necessarily by the Iraqi people. Turkey, Iran and the neighbouring countries are going to need assistance because the problem is absolutely monumental. We are talking about possibly millions of people being displaced. That brings us to the size of displacements of population that we really only saw in World War II. It is something that we are not geared up to meet or to cope with very well at present. But this resolution and the world's actions in trying to meet this need and to overcome these problems are to be praised. I think Australia stands very high and very proud by virtue of the fact that it has been one of the countries which has contributed greatly in an effort to overcome the problems that are being faced by the Kurds and other people of persecuted races. It is an action of the Government that I highly commend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not intend to do that. But because the opportunity has arisen in a way which I would have been prepared to arrange differently if someone had had the courtesy to speak to us about it, I do want to say something about my feelings when I saw this motion. I was appalled by the motion. I do not think that it does Senator Hill any credit. I do not think it has done the Opposition the slightest credit. Knowing Senator Hill's close interest in foreign affairs-I acknowledge his attachment to that subject and, without question, his concern about the appalling plight of these Kurdish people-I think that he probably regrets that this debate was not handled a little more professionally in an organisational way. I do not think it has reflected very well on this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we had to pick one debate on which we would have least liked something like this to happen, it would have been on this kind of motion. I can assure Senator Hill and all Opposition senators that this was my immediate reaction when I read the terms of this resolution. I never thought I was going to speak in the debate, but I will now. Having seen-like most other people-the appalling television pictures of the plight of these people, having been in this chamber when almost every member of the Senate spoke in the debate on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and noted the bipartisan way in which that was necessarily conducted so that a unanimous view would be expressed by this Parliament, I am convinced that that was the proper and appropriate way to deal with something of such gravity. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jones, on behalf of the Government, has moved that paragraph (c) of the motion be deleted, and I foreshadow that I will support that amendment. Indeed, it would have done Senator Hill personally and the Opposition far more credit if a discussion had been held on this extremely important motion. It is irrelevant whether it is moved in General Business or in any other way: it is a motion of the Senate, finally. </PARA>
<PARA> If a discussion had been held with the Government on this motion on the Kurds-and it is the first motion of this kind that we have debated in this Parliament-so that precisely the same result could have been achieved in this equally grave and appalling situation as was achieved with the invasion itself, the motion would have received the bipartisan and unanimous support of this chamber. But, of course, the motion was designed to do precisely the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid suggested-and, after 10 years in opposition it was the most extraordinary suggestion-that in a General Business debate there was an obligation of courtesy on the Government not to participate because it has other opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As someone who has been in Parliament for quite a long time, let me make the point that, if one wants the debate controlled in that way-and I have done this plenty of times-the motion would be phrased and cast so that it did not provoke opposition from the Government benches. However, if a motion like this is designed to score a few points, as paragraph (c) does by attacking the Government, then it is ridiculous to suggest that Government speakers will not participate in the debate to defend the Government and to criticise the attack on it, which is precisely what happened this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Could one think of a motion less likely to provoke the acrimonious and indeed partisan debate that we have heard here tonight than this motion, because of paragraph (c)? I know that I speak on behalf of all my colleagues in this chamber when I say that, if this motion had simply addressed the dreadful plight of the Kurdish people, which is appalling, and if it had been discussed with the Government in the same way that the motions on the invasion of Kuwait had been discussed, then this Senate would have expressed a unanimous resolution expressing our sympathy for the Kurds and perhaps would have suggested unanimously that something could be done about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald continues to dig himself deeper into the hole. I point out to the honourable senator that it is appropriate to attack the Government and, if there had been a debate in this Chamber as substantive as the one on the invasion itself, initiated by either the Government or the Opposition-it would be a resolution of the Senate so in the finish it would not matter how it was initiated-perhaps a subsequent attack on the Government would have been a reasonable thing to do. I say to Senator Hill that I do not read every single motion. I came into the House and I read this, I confess, for the first time and thought, `Well, that's nice; we're going to have a debate on the Kurds and it's going to inevitably turn into a slanging match because there's a clause here that gets stuck into the Government.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would have been far nicer and it would have been a far better result, I think, for all concerned-every one of us collectively-if the resolution had simply, in the strongest terms, expressed our concern for the appalling plight of these people, and it is awful, and had perhaps proposed a course of action that we all could have agreed on, and I think a little bit of discussion would have done it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking for myself and I am talking about my little contribution in here. I just happen to be the bunny who happened to walk in when this debate was going. I am speaking for myself. I have not discussed this with my colleagues. That was my reaction when I sat down here, had a look at what we had in front of us and read the motion. I thought, `Well, that's nice.' It was good enough for all of us, and properly so, to actually seek out a bipartisan position on the invasion of Kuwait. But the subsequent events that have flowed from it-and in many ways, I think far more tragic than the original invasion-did not seem to warrant that same kind of even brief discussion to try to get some resolution. Instead it was, `We'll stick in a barb for the Government.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us just consider the hypocrisy of clause (c) itself. We all know the history of the negotiations of the resolutions-the absolutely unparalleled and unique resolutions of the United Nations that led to that extraordinary alliance that successfully ousted the Iraqi armed forces from their invasion of Kuwait. It was, without question, without argument, the most complex, the most intrusive and the most difficult resolution ever adopted by the United Nations Security Council. When the resolution was first drafted, it was absolutely unclear-and Senator Hill knows this-what the situation was in Iraq. Kurdish rebels had captured several cities in the north; Shi'ite rebels were making progress in the south; and in this chaotic situation, no-one actually knew whether or not the Saddam Hussein Government would survive. </PARA>

So this attack on the Government is a piece of hollow point-scoring partisan sanctimony that does Senator Hill, with his knowledge of foreign affairs, not the slightest personal credit, and certainly does not do the Opposition any credit at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that I do not think there is any current human crisis in the world that is attracting the sympathy and support of the world community more than the plight of the Kurds in Iraq. I am extremely grateful that the Government of the United States finally did move to provide military protection of the airspace over one tiny part of that area so that the Kurds can at least get some relatively safe haven where there is some chance of the aid which is now being directed to them being to good effect. I deeply regret, as a member of this Senate, that a subject as profoundly distressing as this one has been dealt with in the appalling fashion, for whatever reason, that we have dealt with this motion here tonight. It all could have been avoided with just a little bit of discussion and a little bit of communication from one side to another to produce-at least in the first instance-a motion expressing the concern of the entire Senate as to the plight of the Kurds.

I only want to address very briefly the point that Senator Collins made, which was his attack on and criticism of Australian policy and inaction, in this instance, in not taking any action to lobby for inclusion in the Security Council resolution a provision that would offer a safeguard for minorities in Iraq. I said at the outset-and I do not know that Senator Collins was present when I made my contribution-that this business is an embarrassment to the whole international community, and I very much regretted that alliance states, who fought a just war in relieving Kuwait, were not prepared to go the one step further and ensure that upon settlement there was a safeguard for those who were likely to suffer, but rather fell back upon the old position of a balance of power in the region being more important than basic humanitarian concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that the collapse of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust (AETT), and the Hawke Government's refusal to accept its financial responsibilities to replace lost donations intended for Australian arts groups, has caused financial distress to many of those groups;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes, too, that the alternative direct arts donation arrangements, belatedly introduced by the Government two days before the Trust's collapse, fail to cater, at present, for the great bulk of Australian arts bodies whose sources of tax-deductible donations have now been cut off; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) calls on the Hawke Government immediately to provide an appropriate mechanism by which arts bodies that qualified under the Government-approved, but now collapsed, AETT scheme, should be equally covered pending determination of their requests for inclusion in the new direct funding register. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for the urgency of this matter is that at present there is no way the great bulk of Australian arts bodies can receive tax deductible funding because of the collapse of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust (AETT). The arrangement the Government intends to replace the failed AETT with, which is a register to be regulated by a combination of Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the Department of the Treasury, has yet to be put in place, so at the moment there is not even a conduit to replace the AETT through which the great volume of arts bodies that depend so heavily on public tax deductible donations can receive any funding whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a mountain of mail from those bodies, which exhibits a combination of distress at and outrage by the results of the Government's failure to follow Opposition policy at the last two elections-which was to remove this requirement that all tax deductible donations be made through the AETT-and, indeed, the Government's failure to accept pressure from the Australia Council for the last five years and from its own Minister for the arts for the last five years. As I understand it, the opposition has come from the Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> It is as a result of direct and deliberate Government policy and actions that this money has been lost. I understood it was between $5,000 and $6,000, but I received a letter today indicating that it is probably something like $700,000. Those losses are bad enough and have a disastrous impact. Had I time, I would read from some letters of the enormous volume of correspondence that I have received on this matter from small and large organisations whose money has disappeared with the collapse of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now two weeks since the Trust collapsed. We do not know what the criteria will be for arts organisations that used to get their money through the conduit of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust; we do not know what the criteria will be for them to get on this new list; and we do not know whether all those bodies that were eligible under the Elizabethan Theatre Trust system will be eligible in future. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from informal conferences with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that there are real problems involved in creating a new conduit like the AETT and that the Government may not be inclined to do so. But we do not know. We do know that something like $700,000 has been lost to these people because of the Government's idiotic policy, which was reversed two days before the Elizabethan Theatre Trust went broke. The Government suddenly discovered the urgent need to allow direct donations to 10 bodies, the great bulk of which were governmental bodies anyway. The Government, in the knowledge that the AETT was about to go broke, changed the rules but did not bother letting Australian donors know that their money would be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> In this motion we are calling for the creation of a conduit so that arts bodies can continue to get money instead of not only having the tap totally turned off but also having the plug removed by this Government for the money that was in the basin. We want this conduit to exist while organisations are working out how to get on the register and also for those organisations that may well never end up getting on the register because the complications and the requirements to do so may be beyond them in view of their small size. I just hope the Government will not make the same mess by delaying and fiddling around with this matter as it did with making an appointment to the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to stress that it is not simply the Opposition and I who have been saying this; I have put out press releases calling for the Government to make good this amount and to provide a conduit and so on. In addition, a whole range of arts organisations throughout Australia have been pressing for this. I received a press release from the Arts Industry Council today in which it says that $700,000 that had been channelled through the Trust under the Federal Government's tax deductibility scheme must be made good, and that by not moving to change the relevant Act much earlier the Federal Government, instead of providing support for the arts, has effectively taken away $700,000 in private funding. The release continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In these tough times when arts organisations are facing financial hardship, we cannot afford this loss. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, there is plenty more I would like to say on this matter. It is a complicated one. There is real urgency for the Government to act in this matter. This is vital funding, the absence of which will cause the cancellation of some arts activities. For example, the Barossa music festival is in serious financial trouble because of the loss of $30,000, and it cannot be replaced with tax deductible donations from the private sector because there will be no conduit available until this Government gets off the pot and does something about it. We have seen no indication of what will be done about it and no creation of a conduit. This motion calls upon the Government to act, and to act urgently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is about an important matter, but it is somewhat strange in its timing. I accept that Senator Baume is genuinely concerned about the arts, and I think most people in this chamber could not be other than concerned about the circumstances that have arisen with regard to arts funding and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. But it does not necessarily follow from that original concern that one believes this motion is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was a little puzzled to hear Senator Baume talking about the fact that nobody knows what the criteria are for applying to be on the register of cultural organisations and that the Government has not let anybody know about this. Yesterday the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) made it clear, and in the House today he tabled the information about the eligibility criteria for new arrangements for donations to cultural organisations. A mailout of application forms to arts organisations has already commenced so that they can apply to be on that register. That decision was announced yesterday, those criteria were released yesterday, and that material was tabled in the Parliament today. The information is on its way to arts organisations at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And how long will you take to act on it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a question of their applications. The register has been established. Some bodies, as the honourable senator has indicated already, are on it and the applications of others will be processed as they apply. We cannot deal with it more quickly than they apply but we will endeavour to act quickly when they do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The relationship between tax and the arts is a difficult question and it has been the source of a lot of debate, as Senator Baume knows. There are more organisations involved than just the Elizabethan Theatre Trust. There have been a complex range of measures to do with Australian business support for the arts and to do with the whole nature of section 78 of the tax Act. They have been caught up properly in a review of the proper administration of section 78 of the tax Act, not just for the arts, but for other bodies as well. There has been a need for careful consideration of that, and that consideration will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I think these emerging new arrangements for donations to cultural organisations will mean a much better arts policy and a much better tax policy than those that existed previously. I do not share the view-and I do not think, on responsible contemplation, that anybody could-that the Government should have given early warning to people that the Elizabethan Theatre Trust was in financial difficulties. It is the height of irresponsibility to make a public comment saying, `We are concerned that this body may be about to go into receivership'. Nothing is more guaranteed to ensure that it does go into receivership than that sort of statement by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have destroyed that organisation. No serious person has suggested that we should make that sort of arrangement. It would have been, as the Minister said in the House of Representatives today, entirely inappropriate and in my view entirely irresponsible. There has not been a final decision made on the other and important question that Senator Baume raises concerning the difficulties that some organisations may suffer as a result of the moneys intended as donations being called up in the Trust's accounts. The Minister said today in the House of Representatives-and this is the first matter to be attended to-that the Trust itself will do everything possible to ensure that those moneys are passed on and there is some possibility that some of that may take place. That is obviously the first and most appropriate way that action should be taken. Secondly, the Minister has asked the Australia Council for advice on the consequences of the situation for the arts community, and on the basis of that advice, and after the situation with regard to the final washup of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust's accounts is clear, it will then become possible for the Government to make a final decision. </PARA>
<PARA> However, everybody knows that it is not easy to make decisions about adding an extra $500,000 or $700,000 to the arts budget or any other budget. It is not lightly come by and there would be some legitimate debate as to whether it was the best or the highest priority use of $700,000-worth of taxpayers' money, although it is a proper cause of concern and a matter that remains under serious consideration, depending upon the advice from the Australia Council. The important thing to say in response to this motion is that everybody shares the concern that important Australian arts organisations may be jeopardised as a result of the collapse of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust. There are other potential adverse consequences of the Trust's collapse beyond its role as a conduit for taxation, and they are also proper matters for concern which I have discussed with the Australia Council and with the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories. They are matters of proper and continuing interest and concern. </PARA>
<PARA> My opposition to this motion is that it presumes a refusal to accept financial responsibilities in a circumstance where the proper and sensible discussions continue, and that Senator Baume, in his support for it, assumed that the Government should somehow have ensured the collapse of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust by warning everybody that it was going into receivership and that we had failed in some way to make the criteria available, when in fact it was made public yesterday and the information is being distributed, the register has been established, and the bodies that meet those criteria will be included on it on the basis of their applications. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the agreement we entered into about this debate, having spoken for the same length of time as Senator Baume, although there are other things I might have wished to say about it, I conclude my remarks at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There is presently no commercial arrangement between the Defence Department and Carrington Slipways Pty Limited or that Company's Fibreglass Division in relation to the now Defence-owned fibreglass construction facility at Tomago. The Licence Agreement under which the Company operated in the facility was terminated on 25 January 1991 following advice of non-compliance with Agreement terms from the Mortgagee Agent.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are no Contractor personnel employed in the facility but 2 Commonwealth staff have been retained for caretaking and management.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The insolvency of Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd has resulted in termination of the licence arrangements under which the Company operated in the facility. Re-employment of Company workers will depend upon whether a user can be found for the facility.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There are no outstanding contracts between the Defence Department and the Company involving work in the facility although the Company was in contract with the Customs Department for the construction of two 20-metre patrol launches at the time of insolvency. The Customs department is conducting separate negotiations with potential contractors for completion of these vessels outside the Tomago facility.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Tomago GRP facility was purpose-built for Minehunter Inshore (MHI) construction; whilst high-grade GRP shipbuilding facilities exist elsewhere in Australia it is unlikely any would meet the stringent environmental control and minimum-magnetic standards required for modern mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs). In the event that further MHIs or other MCMV types are constructed in Australia it is possible the Tomago facility would be used by the shipbuilder concerned.</PARA>
