It should be made possible for fathers to obtain a fair deal in the Family Court and be able to continue involvement in their siblings upbringing at all times throughout every stage of their children's development, thus being in the best interest of the children themselves, without incurring exorbitant legal costs and manipulated by many of the legal profession. Access Orders from the Family Court should be implemented without delay and at no cost to the non-custodial parent, thus eliminating denial of access. We humbly urge Parliament to direct the Family Court by way of immediate legislation to jealously guard visitation rights and become more liberal with them.</PARA>

John Zabaneh has been denied any input in his children's development and upbringing and has little or no knowledge of his children's progress and wellbeing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating together the Corporations (Unlisted Property Trusts) Amendment Bill and the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). The first Bill's enactment will give breathing space to unlisted property trusts, allowing them to reach agreement with their depositors and thus preventing a run on their funds and ensuring their survival through the current recession. As such, the Bill is a welcome move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main features of the Bill is the introduction of a standard 12-month buy-back or redemption notice period for unlisted property trusts in existence as at 23 July 1991. Unit holders will be able to elect to vary that notice period where it is commercially viable to do so. However, the Australian Securities Commission will have the power to disallow the shortening of the notice period where it is satisfied that it would seriously threaten the liquidity of the trust or the management company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unit holders in financial hardship will also be able immediately to withdraw funds at a discount not exceeding 7.5 per cent. Buy-backs or redemptions are to be made at the price prevailing as at the date of payment as opposed to the date of giving notice or any other date which may be specified in the trust deed. Unit holders who have given to the trust a buy-back redemption notice will retain any entitlements to income or other benefits between the date of giving that notice and the date the funds are actually paid out. The Australian Securities Commission will be given the power to permit the trustee to refuse redemptions where they would have a materially adverse effect on the value of remaining units or otherwise adversely affect the interests of unit holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains some provisions applicable to all prescribed interest schemes which will enable trust deeds to be amended when the amendments are approved by 75 per cent of unit holders&mdash;that is, by value&mdash;voting at a meeting, provided that at least 25 per cent of unit holders, again by value, are eligible to vote. Another provision will also enable unit holders to requisition meetings for the purpose of giving directions to either the trustee or management company, provided that the directions are not inconsistent with the provisions of the trust deed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some matters will be left for future enactment in regulations, and in this bracket management companies and trusts will be required to maintain an adequate level of liquidity at all times. This is a long overdue provision, and a breach of the liquidity requirements will result in the calling of a meeting of investors to consider, among other things, the removal of the manager, the listing of the trust or the winding up of the trust. Borrowings by trusts will be limited to 20 per cent of the gross assets of the trust&mdash;again, a very worthwhile measure and a long overdue limit&mdash;and there will be a capital adequacy requirement for management companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the Australian Democrats welcome this legislation and will support it. However, we note that this is regulation after the event. Unfortunately, the Government has engaged in a deregulation binge in the financial area which has allowed the practices that we have seen in the late 1980s to take over and to take root in our financial system, much to the detriment of our reputation as a nation in capital markets overseas&mdash;not to mention the losses that have been sustained by people who have deposited funds in non-bank financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which is part of the continuing reform of corporate law. It follows a Bill which was brought in earlier last year to require companies to consolidate accounts and which also introduced provisions to strengthen the regulations against insider trading. This Bill today is essentially a machinery Bill. It provides for fixed five-day settlements in our securities markets to ensure that all share transactions are settled promptly. In order to achieve that, these transactions will be supported by expanded securities lending provisions and the national guarantee fund. The Securities Exchanges Guarantee Corporation Ltd is given powers to borrow funds and to levy borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in this Bill will also clarify the fact that the fundraising provisions applicable to prospectuses do not apply to the trading of securities on stock exchanges. Other amendments exclude offers related to capital raisings, which do not require a prospectus, from the provisions making it an offence to make false or misleading statements or to have material omissions in such offers. Other amendments in the Bill clarify the operation of various offences against civil liability for misstatements in, and omissions from, prospectuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a set of provisions regarding registration numbers of companies and other bodies. The moratorium for the display of company numbers on public documents expires at the end of this year. The amendments contained in this Bill exempt cash register receipts produced by an electronic machine and advertising documents which are also not used to make an undertaking for a transaction. In addition, certain abbreviations of company numbers will be allowed in official documents. The Australian Securities Commission will be empowered to exempt companies operating in the transportation of persons or goods to bring these provisions into line with international practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support this Bill, particularly as it is part of an overall program of corporations legislation designed to lift the standards that should be applied to the corporate sector in Australia. Clearly, we need more integrity and more control over what people are permitted to do to ensure that our standing in international markets is redeemed and that our own shareholders and depositors in Australia are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking of integrity, I must refer to some of the remarks that Senator Campbell made in this debate yesterday. He chose to use considerable invective against the Australian Democrats on the basis of our position on political advertising. It must hurt very much that from now on the rich parties will not be able to buy time. From now on the playing field is a little more level for people who obtain a certain number of votes. It shows the paucity of the Opposition's arguments if it has to resort to such language, to invective, when it has clearly run out of substantive arguments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All Australians will be aware that the real estate market, particularly in the commercial parts of our major cities, has collapsed. With that collapse has come about a need to restore confidence and stability in the unlisted property trust industry. For that reason the Government has decided to legislate, with effect from the time of the announcement made by the then Treasurer and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) back in late July, for the imposition of a standard 12-month notice period for the withdrawal of funds from existing public unlisted property trusts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all honourable senators will agree and have acknowledged during the debate already that at the moment unlisted property trusts are unable to attract new investments or sell property at realistic values in the current depressed market. Whereas previously these avenues had enabled managers to achieve the liquidity necessary to meet buy-back or redemption requests on short notice, the fact is that the situation is now completely transformed and there has been a need for the Government to ensure that large bundles of property are not forced onto the market because, quite clearly, not only would that have been to the detriment of the trusts themselves but, we believe, it would also have led to a broader systemic problem for the financial system as a whole. In particular, a significant proportion of the approximately $29 billion of non-performing loans currently being carried by the banking system is secured by commercial property, so no further pressure was needed in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with a further substantial fall in property values, the banks would have been forced to increase their loss provisioning against these loans and to reassess the asset quality of currently performing borrowers. A consequent reduction in the supply of credit flowing from that process could have led to more business failures and further job losses in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a very necessary step to be taken by the Government back in late July. The reasons impelling or requiring that action, that intervention, in the marketplace are still valid and, as I say, the consequences would have been detrimental not only to those who were involved in the trusts themselves but also, I believe, to the whole of the financial system in so far as it was considerably exposed to the security of commercial property and the deterioration there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the introduction of the standard 12-month notice of withdrawal period does not of itself solve the liquidity problem of unlisted property trusts, and it was not intended to do so. Many of those trusts need to restructure their operations so as to provide a better match between the essentially long term nature of real property as an investment and investor demands for ready liquidity. All this does is give a breathing space to management companies and their trustees to reach agreement with unit holders on restructuring proposals. One would hope that by the end of July next year that process will be completed. In fact, I understand it is very largely under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry, having recognised the difficulties, is restructuring. I am advised that many trust managers are pursuing the option of listing their trusts on the stock exchange. Such listing gives investors an immediate market for their investment. Another option is to convert existing trusts into fixed term trusts which do not have a buy-back or redemption obligation, but which operate on the basis that all the properties will be sold and proceeds distributed to investors at the end of a fixed period. They are the sorts of things that are happening during this 12-month breathing period which managers and trustees have been given. I have outlined the main purpose of the Corporations (Unlisted Property Trusts) Amendment Bill. I hope that the Bill will have the desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains an amendment to the corporations legislation to make it clear that the Corporations and Securities Panel has the power to make interim orders pending the final outcome of proceedings brought before it by the Australian Securities Commission. The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia recently ruled that, as a matter of statutory construction, the Panel does not have the power to make interim orders to preserve the rights of persons pending the final determination of an application before it. This amendment will make sure that the Panel has such powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second Bill before the Senate, the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, Senator Spindler this morning and, I think, Senator Campbell last night well pointed out an absolute imperative for Australia: if the reputation of this nation as a place which is attractive to investors is to be restored, having been tarnished so badly in the late 1980s by the activities of some entrepreneurs, it is essential that the restoration of an environment which is attractive to investors has as a very firm foundation secure, well understood, well operating companies and securities legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular reform measure, which does not go to very substantive matters will, nevertheless, help to foster the correct impression that since 1 January 1991 Australia has a corporate and securities regulatory environment which is under the control of this Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, where one Federal Minister, the Federal Attorney-General, is responsible to the Parliament in this area of such importance to the nation and where the Australian Securities Commission, the regulatory authority, is responsible to this Parliament. In addition, a special parliamentary committee, the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, has been set up to continue the supervisory role and the reforming role of the Parliament by means of one of its committees. I know that Senator Campbell is a member of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to continue the process of reform in which this Parliament is engaged in the corporations area, this Bill deals with fundraising, the Australian company number provisions and the settlement of securities transactions. I must say that, in getting the legislation to this chamber this morning, the process which has been devised to allow for public exposure has worked extremely well. It has included the receiving of submissions from interested persons and organisations; the acceptance of the validity of many of the suggestions, which have been incorporated in the amending Bill; and the agreement of the States, the Northern Territory and the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities to the introduction of the Bill into the Parliament. I think that indicates that the machinery to bring corporations reform matters into the Parliament is well structured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there have been a number of matters which warrant clarification, for example, in the fundraising area. This Bill includes a number of largely technical amendments for this purpose with a view to ensuring commercial certainty. The amendments have been set out in the exposure draft; everyone in the investment community is aware of them. With some minor modifications having been made as a result of the exposure period, the Bill is now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Australian company number is concerned, as Senator Campbell and Senator Spindler pointed out, cash register receipts produced by an electronic machine which set out the information stored in the machine will not be required to contain the Australian company number. Apparently, that is an important matter to those who are involved in the selling of goods in the marketplace. Alternative abbreviations for the Australian company number without full stops will be available for use by companies and bodies in all official documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An advertising document issued by a company which is not also used as a document for undertaking some form of transaction with a person will not be required to contain the company's number. The ASC will be empowered to exempt a company or bodies that operate in the transportation of persons or goods from being required to place its company number on documents that are used in connection with transportation, where it is necessary or desirable in the interests of promoting or maintaining consistency in international practice relating to transport documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to keep in mind best international practice in this area is absolutely fundamental and explains the third measure in this Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the regime being introduced by the Exchange to follow internationally accepted standards for settlement of on-market transactions. Failure to implement such a regime would, of course, lead to the temptation for people to turn to offshore markets which are more efficient or more competitive in this respect, and that, of course, would erode the liquidity of Australian securities markets. This is a great danger that has to be avoided. The way in which this Bill does that is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also extends the coverage of the national guarantee fund facilities that have been developed by the Australian Stock Exchange to assist traders to comply with the new settlement requirements. The Exchange will also have access to the fund for losses suffered by the Exchange as a result of brokers defaulting their obligations under these new facilities. The big point I want to make is that this should lead to a great improvement in the international competitiveness of the Australian Stock Exchange, and that is a very important and welcome matter indeed. I thank those Opposition and Democrats senators who have indicated their support for these proposals. I commend the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) introduces amendments expected to strengthen Australia's immigration border controls. It may be something that we would rather bury our heads in the sand about, but we have to face the fact that with the general unrest and increasing number of war zones throughout the world Australia's border problems will increase significantly in the next few years. They need added legislative protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a much sought after destination. While European countries would say that our illegal and refugee problem is insignificant in comparison with their problem, it is certainly not under control. I resist using the phrase `out of control' because, in fairness to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, I believe that there is a difference. However, it ought to be noted that `out of control' may soon be an apt description if the present problems are not corralled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that we do not have the problems of Europe or the UK, but we need to learn from them rather than to blithely ignore them. Too often we are told that it is different in Australia. That is true, but it is also the same. Numbers and reasons for illegals may well be different; numbers and reasons for claiming refugee status may well be different also. I am not arguing that. But the United Kingdom has had 55,000 people claiming refugee status in the past year, with 44,000 apparently lying, and the result was a bill of #325m. The viewpoint outside the UK was that its immigration legislation, as it applied to refugees and illegals, was weak&mdash;with a capital W. The bogus refugee bush telegraph got to work, the flood started and the UK has a crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contest that the way Australia's immigration legislation is affected or not affected&mdash;depending on how critical one wishes to be&mdash;leaves us wide open to gaining the reputation of being weak with regard to border problems. Sure, we are harder to reach, but the fact that 300 boat people have reached us in the past 18 months claiming to be refugees from Cambodia and Vietnam indicates that where there is a will there is always a way. It is estimated that there are already 110,000 to 120,000 illegals in Australia, most arriving on temporary visas and disappearing. Add to that some 24,000 people claiming refugee status, 17,000 of whom are students from the People's Republic of China, and the numbers begin to mount. In fact, the number of people claiming refugee status in Australia is growing at 1,000 a month. That is an alarming statistic which, so far, has not attracted much attention. It has doubled from 500 a month in a relatively short period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We never want to reach the UK situation where its Government was forced to admit publicly it had uncovered that as many as four out of five refugees were not genuine. Emergency legislation to deal with this crisis in the form of the asylum Bill was one of the 12 main Bills in the Queen's Speech some weeks ago. The Bill has just passed through the House of Commons and, with rigid guidelines to allow for fast tracking of applications, increased staff numbers, severe penalties for anyone who aids bogus refugees and immediate deportation for false claims, it is a virtual state of emergency. The UK social services simply cannot cope. The British media headline it as an uncontrollable border crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By virtue of Australia's location, we are saved the severity of the British problem with its geographic and historical connections to areas of present political unrest. But our own problems are very much with us. If the Government were honest, it would admit that it has absolutely no idea how many illegals are running around undiscovered in Australia, that it costs more than $10,000 to locate each one, but that when we find them we also find that some who are denied immigration rights under one category simply try under another category. During 1991, 9,253 illegals were uncovered&mdash;a minute proportion&mdash;and only 4,862 of the 9,000 left the country. The others exercised their entitlement to apply for grant of residence or refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, I have also heard evidence which substantiates the severity of the problem of sham marriages and sham de facto relationships for the purpose of gaining a visa or entry permit to Australia. Abuse in this area is unacceptably high, to the extent that figures have been bandied around to suggest abuse levels of some 70 per cent&mdash;a massive problem when it is realised that some 13,000 people entered Australia on spouse or de facto visas in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pieced together, the many different difficulties in the immigration area indicate that Australia must ensure it is perceived overseas as tough but fair. We must also be perceived as being in control of our migration regulations. At this point we are limping along, attempting to block leaks and cover discrepancies as they are uncovered. It is far from a picture which engenders much faith in the long term success of our current migration policy. The very nearly not in control could jump the barrier, in the future, to out of control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons the Opposition will be supporting this Bill, which attempts to deal with some very real problems according to sensible parameters. It must be said, however, that in supporting it we do retain some serious reservations about the workings of the Government's immigration policies. We wish to put it on record that we also have serious reservations about the continued constant propping of these policies received from a long line of Bills, four of which we are dealing with today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Amendment Act (No. 2) has three main components. Firstly, it creates new offences in relation to immigration due to marriage or de facto relationships. Secondly, it increases the Government's information gathering powers in relation to those believed to be illegal immigrants. Thirdly, it allows for regulations to authorise the Minister to fix a limit on the number of visas or permits in a particular class which may be granted in a particular financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dealing with sham marriages and de facto relationships, the Bill makes it an offence for a person to arrange a marriage for the purpose of assisting one of the parties to obtain a permit to stay in Australia. The maximum penalty for a breach of this provision will be a $100,000 fine, 10 years imprisonment, or both. If a person believes, on reasonable grounds, that two people are not de facto spouses and makes it look as if they are for the purpose of obtaining a permit to stay in Australia, the same penalty will apply&mdash;as it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hoped that this provision will help deal with the unscrupulous migration agents who, for a price, arrange sham marriages and set up de facto spouses. It will also be an offence for a person to apply to stay in Australia on the basis of a marriage or de facto relationship if he or she does not intend to live permanently with the other person in a genuine and continuing relationship. Any non-citizen convicted will become an illegal entrant. It will also be an offence to nominate persons to stay in Australia if they do not have any such intention. The maximum penalty is two years imprisonment. Given the proven massive level of abuse in this area, these amendments are essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also permits the obtaining of information and documents about the identity and location of illegal entrants. The provisions in clause 3, new subsection 22A, require any person whom the Minister believes capable of supplying information on a suspected illegal immigrant to supply information on that person. The maximum penalty for a breach of this provision will be 12 months imprisonment. It will be an offence to protect a suspected illegal by giving false and misleading statements, and the maximum penalty will be $12,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have concerns about the ramifications to lawyers of this provision. While principles of interpretation of common law rule that legal privilege cannot be overridden by statute unless specifically stated in the legislation, the legal community has the view that the Minister does not intend to be bound by this as it relates to the workings of clause 22A of this Bill. He apparently is of the view that we should test it and see and let the courts decide, and has said as much in a letter to Mr Phillip Ruddock, the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we do not seek to amend the Bill, we wish to put on record that we will be following this particular problem with interest. For surely it is crucial that anyone who is unsure of his immigration status and his rights under Australian law should be able to express without fear and in confidence his situation to a lawyer. It does nothing for the rights of the individual to fear that his lawyer will be obliged to reveal confidential conversations and documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also feel it is worth making the point at this stage of the Bill that the loopholes remain huge. After all, we have illegals who have no trouble managing to acquire a tax file number, not to mention a Medicare card. The Opposition has presented suggestions of employer sanctions for hiring illegals, which seem quite logical. The Minister has resisted this thrust thus far. I suggest it be re-examined rather than ridiculed or put aside simply because the Opposition has proposed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also provides the Minister with greater control to ensure published limits are not exceeded by amendments which set limits on the number of visas or permits which can be granted in a particular class. I understand this is to deal primarily with the special assistance class of migrant announced some time ago. We accept the need for such amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, in total, tidies up and strengthens areas of the immigration program. We do not oppose it. As explained, our concerns are with the limited success of the present immigration program and regulations. It is not an area we can allow to drift, yet the Government appears reluctant to face up to some of the problems that are clear and quite evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1991 proposes minor amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act to provide for a person to obtain citizenship by descent through registration. The Opposition supports this legislation because it addresses a concern we have fought to have dealt with. However, we make the point that we still have concerns that this is yet another amendment Bill dealing with yet another element of a much larger problem which good government would take the time, and make the effort, to consider as a whole, instead of in this typical ad hoc crisis management style which is the hallmark of Australia's current immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will redress a number of unfortunate incidences created by changes to the Citizenship Act in 1984. These changes led to many people who believed they were Australian citizens, either through descent, armed service or possession of an Australian passport, discovering that they did not have entitlement to Australian citizenship. Until November 1984, British subjects with close ties to Australia, spouses of Australians, children born abroad to Australian parents and frequent business travellers to Australia were all granted Australian passports. But the 1983 recommendations of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking recommended that only Australian citizenship should be used as a guide to who should be granted an Australian passport. In line with that worthy recommendation, Australian passports issued before 22 November 1984 were no longer accepted as evidence of Australian citizenship and to acquire an Australian passport either a birth certificate or citizenship papers were necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same year the Australian Citizenship Act had inserted a new section 10B. At the time section 10B appeared sensible and harmless. It limited the registration of Australian citizenship by descent to persons under the age of 18. It was intended to tighten the Act to ensure that citizenship was available only to those with close and genuine ties to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logic appeared to be that, if someone reached adulthood, age 18, without claiming ties and applying for citizenship, their ties to Australia could hardly be described as close. However, the amendment caught and disadvantaged many people over the age of 18 who truly believed they were Australian, including children born overseas to Australian parents and issued with Australian passports overseas when young. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some well publicised, quite traumatic cases revealed in the media as a result of the problems that section 10B has created. It left genuine Australians because of age out in the cold, unable to claim the prize&mdash;Australian citizenship&mdash;which they believed was rightfully theirs. This Bill now provides that persons who are over the age of 18 and who could have applied for registration as an Australian citizen by descent, provided they have an acceptable reason for not having so registered, can apply for registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also includes an amendment to section 10B which makes it clear that a person cannot acquire citizenship by descent through registration if their parent also acquired citizenship by the same process unless that parent has lived in Australia for two years. That appears to be a reasonable method of ensuring that there are no ongoing entitlements for citizenship to pass through families to their descendants if each generation is not to live in Australia. The legislation therefore has the support of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third Bill to be taken through its remaining stages is the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill 1991. This Bill and the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) 1991 are part of the Government's legislative program to introduce new charges for certain groups of applicants, or more correctly their sponsors, for granting them a visa or entry permit into Australia. We will not oppose the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill. The Bill is designed to raise a charge of $822. It arose from the Budget and therefore it has been applied to those in certain categories who have sought a visa or entry permit from 21 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) will give effect to the provisions of the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill. It will therefore commence on the same day. It amends section 24 and section 34 of the Migration Act which relate to the granting and the refusal of visas or entry permits respectively. In the case of each section, the Bill introduces a requirement for the Minister to provide a notice in writing to an applicant seeking to enter or remain in Australia. This states that the grant of the class of visa or entry permit applied for cannot occur unless the charge payable under the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act 1991 has been paid. The Bill contains a prohibition on the Minister granting a visa or entry permit until the charge is paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the regulation-making power under the Migration Act is amended to provide for the refund of charges paid under the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act under exceptional circumstances. This Bill gives effect to the health services levy and will not be opposed. However, I need to make clear the reason why we do not oppose the Bills. It is basically because receiving at least some percentage of migrant costs up-front is better than the existing system which is severely flawed and open to widespread abuse. It costs the Australian taxpayer millions in unpaid debts when a sponsor family cannot honour the agreements of the support scheme into which they entered to achieve the entry of their relatives to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity at this point to say that the coalition's Fightback package has shown the courage to tackle the issue of health and social welfare benefits to migrants in a far more pertinent way. Until a change of government occurs, we will no doubt continue to limp forward applying a procession of tiny bandaids to the terminally ill Migration Act and its confused regulations. If the Government were not so concerned about the views of pressure groups, it would admit that radical surgery was the only way to effect recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the two Bills we are dealing with today are small bandaids attempting to cover a much larger sore. These bandaid measures are aimed at catching cheques for $822 because at the other end of the system, in the assurance of support scheme as it applies at present, some $20m was lost this year in benefits not recovered. These are benefits which should have been reclaimed from families who had undertaken to sponsor migrants or visa holders, thereby supporting their costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson told the Senate that some $32m had been spent on Jobsearch allowances, Newstart and special benefits for newly arrived migrants under the support system, yet only $1.77m had been recovered. In other words, the immigration program is in its usual chaos, with the Australian taxpayer paying the price. In line with that usual muddle, confusion and inappropriate organisation in the migration legislation area, this level of unrecoverable debt under the present assurance of support scheme is to be quite expected while certainly not condoned. The Auditor-General was most scathing in his efficiency audit of the Department and this is borne out by the present government methodology of tack-on-another-bandaid legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an attempt to lower the debt level the Government has arrived at this new bonding arrangement. It requires someone to put money up-front for a levy on health and associated costs for the individuals they sponsor into Australia. We are informed that the new medical levy is expected to recoup some $9.9m in a full financial year. It affects certain groups: for example, those entitled to a parent visa in which the balance of family test has been met. It also applies to visa class 104: those who come within the special preferred class of family in respect of minor orphans, special need relatives, remaining relatives&mdash;that is, those left behind because of the migration of all other family members&mdash;and certain aged dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $822 is indexed against the all-group consumer price index and is therefore subject to an increase where the indexation in any relevant year calculated from 21 August 1992 is greater than one, and that charge cannot fall below its highest previously determined level. It has been calculated that the charge represents an estimated 50 per cent of the contribution towards the cost of the Commonwealth in providing access to medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits to assured persons during their first two years in Australia. It does not, however, apply to the cost that might be generated either through the private sector or by State governments&mdash;which I believe is a matter of some concern to the States. Neither is it intended to recover any further health related costs, such as payment of sickness benefits, in the first two years of settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills we are dealing with today and the regulations to be shortly introduced are components of a much more limited assurance of support scheme than the one which fails at present. The new scheme shortens the duration of support to two years instead of five and does not cover the same range of benefits as were previously covered. As well as the up-front health levy of $822, the existing assurance of support scheme will now be supplemented by the payment of a refundable bond by some applicants in the preferential family reunion program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bond&mdash;$3500 for principal applicants and $1500 for others in the family over the age of 18&mdash;will be used as the first avenue of recovery of debts incurred by assured migrants in relation to special benefits, Jobsearch and Newstart allowance paid by the Commonwealth. The bond must be paid before the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs will issue a visa authorising entry for those who apply to enter Australia on or after 21 August 1991. However, the liability of the scheme no longer extends to accommodation, surgical and dental treatment and any other allowance of support for the assured migrant. In addition, debts incurred by the State, public or charitable organisations will no longer be recoverable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Coalition supports the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill 1991 and the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. It is simply to be regretted that this chamber has to deal with a steady procession of bandaid legislation because of sloppy administration and poor legislation being introduced in the first place. </PARA>

Therefore, as the legislation that we have before us is silent, and the principal Act is silent, is it not a fact that the common law rule stands, unlike the case cited by the Minister in his correspondence of 4 December to Mr Ruddock?

More importantly, my advice is that the objectives of the Government with regard to seeking information about illegals is sufficiently limited&mdash;that is, it is in pursuit of information about matters such as identity and location rather than confidential information provided, and that we may well be able to achieve the Government's objectives without in any way coming into the conflict that would lead us into the courts and to challenges as to whether the legal professional privilege question is being impeded. </PARA>

I think the Parliamentary Secretary has covered part of the area of privacy, section 22K, and he has said that a great deal of information is made available to State and Federal agencies, but at no time was it ever contemplated that the information would be made available for the purposes of assisting the Minister in investigations. I hope I am not going over ground the Parliamentary Secretary has already covered, but concerns have been expressed in relation to the use of that information which has been collected for other purposes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information. I understand that this question was raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The new section to which we refer&mdash;83D and, in particular, 83D(3)&mdash;was inserted because the Government recognises that there are persons in the community who enter into arranged marriages as a matter of custom. This section, therefore, gives the parties to a traditional but genuine arranged marriage a defence to what would otherwise be an offence if the marriage were entered into to obtain residence in Australia. The view is that, therefore, it is not actually a reversal of the onus of proof but provides a defence for people who otherwise would be considered to have committed an offence. The Government's view is that 83D(3) does not, in fact, reverse the onus of proof.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed my pleasure to be leading for the coalition in this debate on the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. I do so at a most significant time&mdash;a time of high drama, where Australians are clamouring for a new deal in taxation. The timing of this debate is indeed perhaps a little unfortunate for the Government as it coincides with the overwhelming support from the Australian community for a change to our tax structure and an endorsement of the coalition's policy of reform&mdash;a policy of reform that will enable Australia to fight back against declining living standards and give hope to the future aspirations of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's tax reform proposals under the appropriate title `fighting back' give Australia a clear signal that the Liberal and the National parties are leading the tax debate in Australia. The legislation before us this morning is nothing more than an attempt to catch up and patch up a job that certainly does not match up to the coalition's goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in today's amendments are an acknowledgment by the Government that the problems of collection of sales tax in the 1990s have moved well away from the goals set by the original drafters of sales tax legislation in the 1930s. While some people might say that sales tax is an economically cheap tax to collect, the actual numbers of collectors is extremely high in relation to the number of registered taxpayers. Such messages indicate a skewing effect, ensuring that certain goods and certain taxpayers bear a burden unrelated to that borne by the rest of the community. Such a situation does not demonstrate a fair and equitable tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's answer is to eliminate seven taxes and replace them with one goods and services tax. The coalition's proposal contains a strong bias to business which will reap $20 billion of benefits while, at the same time, corporations will surrender less than $1 billion of tax for the adjustment of income tax rates in the corporate sector from 39 per cent to 42 per cent. In fact, the raising of this tax is necessary for equity reasons to correspond after 1996 with the top personal marginal tax rate. Regrettably, the Labor Party has not been astute enough to perceive this gap as being conducive to the creation of tax avoidance schemes and has done nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill now before the Senate has been put forward by this Government to give effect to one of three taxation reforms the Government proposed in its 12 March industry statement. Madam Acting Deputy President, permit me to refresh your memory as to why the industry statement was made. This was the economic statement to address what Australia must `do together to meet the economic challenges facing this country'. Perhaps it is because we are still waiting for the majority of the statement's recommendations to be enacted that we have unemployment exceeding 10 per cent, record foreign debt and record current account deficits. However, even after the recommendations are enacted, obviously the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself does not believe that the country's economic challenges will be fully met. Why else did he need to make a further employment statement only last month?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned before, there are three matters which were given the title of taxation reforms in the 12 March industry statement. The first matter is tax exemptions for inputs to goods production, which we will obviously be dealing with in legislation that will be before us later today. The second matter is the revised depreciation arrangements, which has been the topic of a fair amount of debate in this chamber, even though legislation has not been introduced. The Government's proposed revised depreciation arrangements did not meet industry agreement and we are still awaiting the objections to be dealt with before the Government makes a legislative move in this area. I remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) of all of the businesses that will be balancing up on 31 December and 30 June. With no legislative base, how are they going to be dealt with? This Government has placed such corporations in quite an impossible and unfair situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter is the tax treatment of environmental impact studies. This matter has been addressed to some extent in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, which was debated earlier this week. However, because of Government priorities, the second reading debate has not been completed. So this reform still has no statutory basis because it has yet to receive final approval from the Senate. If amendments are made, the Bill will have to go back to the other House before royal assent can be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the Sales Tax Amendment Bill (No. 3) is to extend the exemptions that currently exist in sales tax legislation to cover more comprehensively business input costs. It is interesting to reflect on why the Government wants to extend wholesale sales tax exemptions in respect of business input costs, particularly in the light of the current debate in Australia about the introduction of a goods and services tax. The Government has responded in this way because it has realised the weakness inherent in the sales tax system compared with our goods and services tax proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the March statement we learn why the Government wants to introduce these additional exemptions to the wholesale sales tax. The industry statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures reduce the cost burden of wholesale sales tax on inputs of goods producers (and sub-contractors performing eligible activities) and thereby reduce the cascading of the cost through the production chain.</PARA>
<PARA>Those words echo the ones we have been using about the need for a GST. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Production costs will therefore be reduced by significantly more than the revenue cost of the measures. In particular, the competitiveness of Australia's export and import-competing industries will be enhanced by the new WST exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not interesting that, from time to time, we hear from the Labor Party that the wholesale sales tax does not add to the cost of exports? Yet in the industry statement of 12 March we have in print the admission that the competitiveness of Australia's export- and import-competing industries will be enhanced by the new wholesale sales tax exemption. This statement contradicts the Labor Party's earlier stand. I will quote further from the industry statement, which goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many inputs to goods production are already exempt from WST. The existing exemptions include the aids to manufacture provisions, exemptions for goods used in mining activities and for agricultural and fishing equipment. The extensions announced in this statement will significantly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>note the word `significantly'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">reduce the remaining elements of input taxation facing goods producers.</PARA>
<PARA>I again remind the Senate that the statement says `significantly reduce' not eliminate, as the Opposition's goods and services tax will do. So, in the first place, we have a clear recognition by the Government that the wholesale sales tax regime is one that imposes costs on the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is contestable then, on the basis of the words used in the industry statement, the second reading speech and this legislation, that the wholesale sales tax imposes costs on the Australian business community, the mining sector and the farming community which result in a reduced capacity to compete. It is also interesting to note that, by providing $445m worth of exemptions in this Bill, the Government claims that the business community will benefit in the vicinity of $1 billion. There is a problem with arithmetic there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that the compounding effect on the business community of the wholesale sales tax, where exemptions will now be provided, is about double the actual impact of the taxes is quite clear. It is also very important to understand this when looking at the workings of the wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation concedes philosophically that there is an overwhelming case for the introduction of a goods and services tax in Australia. As I proceed to address specific aspects of this legislation, honourable senators will see why a goods and services tax would not only address the issues that this legislation addresses, but also would do so in a comprehensive way which, effectively, would ensure that at the end of the day no business inputs are subject to sales tax, the price of exports actually declines, and there is no compounding effect from the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will alter the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 and the sales tax regulations. In so doing, it will extend the existing wholesale sales tax exemption to cover a wide range of business inputs for use by goods producers and certain other categories of persons. Thirteen eligible business goods categories to which exemption applies are created, including: eligible primary production goods; eligible mineral production goods; eligible manufacturing goods; eligible transport goods; eligible engineering and technical design goods; eligible storage, handling and dispatch goods; eligible computer equipment; eligible research and development goods; eligible sea cargo handling goods; eligible international air cargo handling goods; mixed-use eligible business goods; mixed-use eligible road vehicles; and parts for goods covered by any of the above categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed sales tax amendments will also extend exemptions to the following goods when used&mdash;and here is a problem word&mdash;mainly in eligible activities. The word `mainly' will create a whole raft of litigation. These goods will include lubricants, office furniture, equipment and consumables, road vehicles when used exclusively within the production premises, and goods such as hand tools when used in agricultural activities or fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of an overall comment on this Bill, I say that if this is an example of the new simplified method of taxation legislation then, despite some earlier good starts, I am afraid we have slipped back woefully. It is not only difficult to read, but also difficult to comprehend and thus difficult to administer and difficult for those who practise in this area. Complex legislation leads to only one outcome: confused application. People will endeavour to claim exemption where no exemption exists, and those who are entitled to an exemption will be too baffled by the legislation to learn of their entitlement and thus they will miss out. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>There is an obligation on government to publicise and distribute widely to the diffused users outlined in the 13 categories, which I mentioned earlier, the exact meaning and intent of the legislation. One thing is certain: following the passage of this Bill, there will be no shortage of work for accountants or lawyers working in the sales tax area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem associated with the complex nature of the writing of this Bill is that items which the Government intended to have exempted by this legislation have unfortunately been lost in the complexity of this Bill. For example, I believe it was the Government's intention, when listing eligible sea cargo handling goods for exemption, to exempt all goods used to handle cargo or containers on a wharf. However, it appears that the Government may have overlooked the fact that all the machinery used on wharves has to be lubricated because, despite exempting lubricants from sales tax for aids to manufacture, it appears that the Bill does not allow for lubricants used on eligible sea cargo handling goods to be exempt. I think that should be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in schedule 1 the definition of `mainly' is to the extent of more than 50 per cent. This varies from, and replaces, the definition of `main' which was inserted only last year and which had the meaning of not less than 50 per cent. I would be interested to hear from the Government why there has been this change and how the Government will attempt to argue its way out of the need for simplicity in the confusion that has been created. It is all very well to give this definition, but how can the vendor, the purchaser, or the Tax Office for that matter, prove what the main use of the engineering and technical design goods is in my case?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the same question when debating the exemption of sales tax on computer equipment, and we received a very unsatisfactory answer. I hope the Government can do better on this occasion. How does the vendor know that the purchaser is buying the good as an eligible exempt good? Does the vendor ask the purchaser to sign a document to this effect? Alternatively, does the purchaser need to keep a log book of his or her use of the equipment in order to justify to the Tax Office that the good is used 50 per cent of the time in its capacity as an eligible sales tax exempt item? I certainly hope not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not address the fundamental matter of the administration of the sales tax law. I believe Senator McMullan will jump to his feet and tell me that there are tax rulings which address this problem. Of course, Senator McMullan would be right&mdash;sales tax ruling ST(NS)3 issued on 11 July 1991, and effective from that date, covers such matters as understanding the term `use' in the sales tax legislation, how `use' affects exemption, and principles for determining exemption according to use. We are told in ruling ST(NS)3 paragraph 1.7 that ruling ST(NS)4 sets out the practical steps one should take in approaching the question of classifying; that is, determining the rate of tax on goods. When read in conjunction, these two rulings provide a comprehensive guide to the Taxation Office view of how to determine the rate of sales tax on a particular good. The only problem I have with this is that I do not think ST(NS)4 has been released yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will illustrate this point further by looking again at the question of lubricants. The last time we had a change to the sales tax exemptions on lubricants was in 1985 approximately. The reason given for the change was the administrative difficulty in policing how the exemption was to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill still has not solved this administration problem. If a person were to buy oil in bulk, say a 200-litre drum, and use at least 50 per cent on aids to manufacture, then the exemption would apply. However, if the oil were used to lubricate a salesman's car, the tax would have to be paid on it. How the tax is to be payable or how the tax exemption is to be administered is anybody's guess. No administrative process is outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a problem in administering an exemption when a good is sold by retail. Consider the example of an electrical contractor who buys what he needs from a retailer to install into factory premises. The goods have passed the taxable point, so how does the person know whether they will be tax exempt? Under the wholesale sales tax arrangements this is a complicated situation, and the electrical contractor probably would have to apply to the Commissioner to get an exemption. Under a goods and services tax regime the tax would just have to be paid and then written off when the contractor put in his return at the end of the month or the quarter. In other words, if one is in business, effectively one will get a credit the following month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before leaving this topic surrounding the word `mainly', which will cause an awful amount of confusion, I would like to comment that it would appear, given the direction that this sales tax legislation has taken, that the Government is moving towards requiring more than 50 per cent use of goods for the goods to qualify for sales tax exemption. Here is further confusion. There are a number of exemptions in the Act for the mining and farming communities where the 50 per cent qualification does not currently apply. I ask the Government's representative in this matter, Senator McMullan, to either confirm or deny that this is the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I wish to raise with regard to wholesale sales tax exemptions is discrimination between particular types of industries. For example, major publishers are manufacturers and they are accepted as such by the Taxation Office. However, if they use a computer to make a design which is printed on paper, that computer is not sales tax exempt. Yet the same computer, when used to make a design which is put onto a metal plaque, is sales tax exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst looking at the flaws in the wholesale sales tax exemptions system I would like to give the Senate a further example. A specialist agency has an opportunity to win a contract to cut metal for a manufacturer of whitegoods. The special computerised metal cutting machine he buys to do the job qualifies for wholesale sales tax exemption. The businessman needs to run the machine only two days a week to produce the output needed by the whitegoods manufacturer, so the owner of the computerised metal cutting machine approaches the building industry with an offer to cut steel to length. If the machine is used three days a week cutting steel for the building industry and only two days for the whitegoods manufacturer, the machine no longer qualifies for wholesale sales tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a hotchpotch regime of sales tax exemptions; it is doing enormous harm to industry and it is discouraging the effective use of up to date plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar tale of woe can be told about computer equipment. If a business uses its computer for tasks other than administration, then the computer qualifies for wholesale sales tax exemption. However, if too many administrative programs are loaded onto the computer, and it is used for these purposes, it no longer qualifies for exemption. There is a gaping hole in the logic. Once we make one exemption, a Pandora's box of exemptions is opened up, with inconsistencies and anomalies abounding. I have given only a few examples to demonstrate the problems arising from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting point about this Bill is the timing of its application. The fact that the changes which this Bill will enact are effective only from the date of royal assent, as opposed to the date of announcement of the changes, means that businesses are avoiding buying equipment or using equipment purchased. The reason for doing this is that a refund can be obtained if the goods are not used before the date of royal assent. As well as deferring purchasing decisions, businesses are stockpiling lubricants and computer paper which will become exempt when the Bill receives royal assent. It is a ridiculous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax changes are usually dated from the time of initial announcement, but the industry has lobbied hard against that practice, partly because previous announcements have always resulted in an increase in sales tax. Ironically, now, when the Bill will result in a decrease in sales tax, the Tax Office has agreed with industry and made the date of application the date of royal assent. But it will cause problems of enforcement and substantiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of eligible research and development goods, there are a couple of matters I wish to raise. Firstly, the term `eligible research and development goods' does not extend to software created goods. It appears that the Government has not come to grips with the fact that most research and development programs now, if they are related to a product process, would also involve software. Take, for example, the situation of a major research project into developing a new production process for which a new program is written after a number of man years have been spent working on it. The outcome is a new production schedule which cuts costs in half. This has actually occurred. It would appear that the equipment used to generate that new program is not sales tax exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be pleased to have Senator McMullan clarify this for the Senate, particularly as I may have misunderstood the situation. I certainly hope I have, for the sake of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I am concerned that as a result of this amendment there may be some confusion with regard to the roles of the Taxation Commissioner and the Industry Research and Development Board. When section 73B was introduced into the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Government made it very clear that the Commissioner would never have the power to determine what qualified as research and development but that this would be the sole responsibility of the Industry Research and Development Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, under the definition of `eligible research and development goods', one of the conditions which has to be satisfied is that the goods are for use by a person being either a goods producer or an eligible research and development entity. The Industry Research and Development Board is responsible for determining what constitutes an eligible research and development entity, but I imagine that the Commissioner is responsible for determining who is a goods producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that for the original intent of section 73B to be upheld, it will be necessary for section 10(1)(a) of this Bill to be amended to include a goods producer and an eligible research and development entity. Once again I would be interested to have the Minister's advice on this matter; if he agrees, we could move an amendment. I think it could be easily facilitated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad thrust of the March statement of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was that he was going to do something for goods producers and exporters in this country. The clearly stated intention of that statement and several others made around that time was that we had to be more competitive to overcome the problems inherent in our taxation system and in other matters. This Government has attempted to do this by providing exemptions under this Bill, but that system has not worked and will never satisfactorily work under the wholesale sales tax regime which the Government insists upon imposing upon this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this Bill is not opposed by the Opposition, my colleague Senator Short will move amendments to it when he addresses the legislation. However, that will only serve, I think, to complicate the Bill before us, which is already a very complex and complicated piece of legislation. The sales tax laws of this country are crying out for simplification, and this will not be realised until the current Hawke led Labor Government is replaced by a forward looking coalition government which can provide some direction to this country and the necessary taxation base to improve the lot of goods producers and exporters in the form of a goods and services tax. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because it is a selective tax, one that can be targeted, it has the enormous social advantage of exempting the basic necessities of life from tax. The basic food items consumed in the Australian economy&mdash;clothing and footwear&mdash;are completely exempt from tax as a result of this tax having a range of rates and, therefore, making it possible for governments to say, `The basic staples of life, the basic necessities, can be tax exempt but the people with large incomes, who can afford to buy luxury goods, can afford to pay a higher rate so they are taxed at a 30 per cent rate'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things about the wholesale sales tax is that its impact on final selling prices depends on profit and business mark-ups and margins in the commercial sector. One of the misconceptions around the place at the moment is that somehow a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax automatically leads to a higher price than a 15 per cent retail tax. I notice that some people opposite seem to believe that if the current 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on items is replaced with a 15 per cent value added tax or, in their sanitised language, a goods and services tax, prices in the Australian economy will fall. That is a nonsense. It depends on profit mark-up. It is very simple to show that the final selling price of a business with a 40 per cent mark-up will be higher with a 15 per cent goods and services tax&mdash;or, as I call it, a value added tax&mdash;than with a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anything above a 40 per cent margin will lead to higher prices and higher inflation as a result of the introduction of a value added tax. That is one of the reasons that errors and mistakes have been made in the Opposition's calculations of the inflationary impact of this so-called tax swap, the proposal to substitute $27 billion value added tax for $9 billion wholesale sales tax. In fact, one error the Opposition has made is to assume that a 20 per cent sales tax has a larger effect on selling prices than does a 15 per cent value added tax. Of course, that is a nonsense; it depends totally on the profit margins. In many sections of the Australian economy, where there is less competition and firms and producers have less market power, there are much larger margins. In a number of sectors of the economy, 100 per cent mark-ups are very common. A goods and services tax rate of 15 per cent would lead to a massively higher level of selling prices than would a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great advantages of the present wholesale sales tax is that it is a very simple tax. Administratively it is a very cheap, very simple and very efficient tax; in fact, it is incredibly efficient compared with taxes such as value added taxes. It is interesting to note that there are about 75,000 collection points for the wholesale sales tax in Australia at present. Because it is a wholesale sales tax, it is collected only from wholesalers or importers, of which there is a relatively small number in Australia, compared with the number of businesses. It may well be that we have over one million businesses in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's plan to replace this tax with a value added tax means that virtually every one of those one million-plus businesses would be a collection point for the tax and there would be paperwork and red tape involved as a result of the proposed tax. One of the important things to notice about the wholesale sales tax is how focused it is as a tax. For example, figures that I have seen quoted  by  a  large  accounting  practice  in</PARA>
<PARA>Australia suggest that a mere 284 taxpaying units contribute about 48 per cent of the entire revenue collected by the wholesale sales tax. These are not my figures, they are figures from one of the five big accounting companies. </PARA>

If we look at the last annual report of the Australian Taxation Office, we see just how efficient and cheap the wholesale sales tax is to collect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the efficiency of the wholesale sales tax, it costs only 49c to collect every $100 of revenue. As I have pointed out, the yardstick has always been personal income tax. I understand that the costs of collection are about $1 for every $100 of revenue collected. Let us look overseas at the conservative Government in the United Kingdom, which those opposite worship. It has operated a value added tax for many years at increasingly escalating rates. One point that comes through about the United Kingdom's value added tax&mdash;the one that the Liberals here want to copy&mdash;is that it costs $2 to collect every $100 of revenue. On the one hand we have a very efficient and simple wholesale sales tax which at present costs 49c to collect $100; on the other hand, the value added tax&mdash;the one that the Liberals want to copy&mdash;costs $2 to collect every $100 of revenue.

It is very illuminating to see what he said on page 766 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 12 March 1981. He was referring to the multi-stage VAT that the Liberals wanted to bring into Australia. Mr Howard said this in his speech after looking at the various tax reforms options:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A multi-stage VAT was rejected fairly quickly because it would have imposed an enormous paper work burden on both taxpayers and collecting authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>That was John Howard, the last Liberal Treasurer in Australia. This was his official statement as Treasurer in the Fraser Liberal Government canvassing every one of the options for tax reform in Australia. I recommend this speech to everybody as a wonderful read. Mr Howard rejected the VAT proposal, which the Liberals are now embracing, on the grounds of an enormous paperwork burden on both taxpayers and collecting authorities. The present wholesale sales tax is an extraordinarily simple tax. It costs 49c to collect $100 and 284 taxpayers contribute 48 per cent of the revenue. What an efficient tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go on, because at the moment I am just getting warmed up to my task. This very illuminating speech from Mr Howard went on to talk about the options for tax reform. He also said this, as recorded on page 766:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move on to Senator Watson, who was the last speaker in this debate. Senator Watson claimed that somehow sales tax has a significant impact on the Australian economy; that it has a big impact on business costs and so forth. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson used the term `cascading'. That is important: by taking these sales taxes off inputs we have a magnified effect in lowering business costs. The impact on business costs is not the loss of revenue to the Budget and it is not the $200m this financial year and the $375m next financial year; the figures which come out of the business cost structure are magnified because of the impact of profit mark-ups and margins on the base, including the tax. If we remove the tax, we lower the base on which the mark-ups are made. This financial year we will see an impact with lower business costs of about $400m, rising to some $700m next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted to see recently an article written by a prominent Brisbane tax expert, Mr Darryl Somerville, from the Coopers and Lybrand partnership in Brisbane. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on 25 November this year, in an article entitled `Changes to sales tax could save up to $454m', Mr Somerville was in fine form. He pointed out that this legislation brought in by the Hawke Labor Government in fact represented `the greatest changes to business inputs since 1945'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>He has really identified this tax as having the greatest impact on business costs since 1945 in reducing costs by removing the sales tax. That is how he views the legislation. He went on to say that the tax changes `should make Australian mining, manufacturing and primary industries more competitive'. Here we have an independent observer of this reform making a clear and concise statement about his view of how it will affect business. I notice that clause 8 of the legislation provides for a refund of sales tax collected since the industry statement, so basically any purchases since that time will not be subject to the sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important things about this measure is that it will improve net returns for a number of Australian producers and a number of businesses. For example, as a result of this proposal the farm sector will see a lower cost structure and its net returns will be greater. Similarly, those firms in the traded goods sector of the Australian economy&mdash;those firms competing with imports&mdash;will see a lower cost structure as the sales taxes are taken off the inputs into their production, and that will help their competition with imported products. Those are some of the items in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of items of production will be exempted. Goods used in activities such as the storage, handling and dispatch of products will be sales tax exempt. The Bill provides for this by bringing in a definition of eligible business goods. A range of products such as lubricants, office equipment, stationery and hand tools will be exempt from sales tax as  a result of this legislation. Road vehicles used wholly within production premises will also be exempt from the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I am delighted to see that this legislation does not exempt luxury cars from sales tax. This is the great difference between this legislation of the Hawke Labor Government and the proposal from those opposite. They would take the 30 per cent sales tax off luxury motor vehicles and replace it with a 15 per cent goods and services tax&mdash;or, as I have pointed out, a 15 per cent value added tax. I think that is totally unjustifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We refuse to go down that road of making luxury motor vehicles vastly cheaper in the Australian economy. It is just ridiculous for the Liberals to say that their proposal to bring in a 15 per cent value added tax would somehow benefit Australia's overseas balance of payments. The mind boggles as to how the balance of payments would be helped by making luxury motor vehicles cheaper by bringing in a 15 per cent value added tax, instead of having a 30 per cent wholesale sales tax on them. It would simply make a range of models of luxury motor vehicles vastly cheaper and, therefore, would lead to a kick-start in imports to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn very briefly to the Treasury analysis of the impact of sales tax on the Australian economy. Again, Senator Watson was going on earlier that somehow the sales tax had a major, significant or draconian effect on the Australian economy. We have to put it in context. The sales tax collects only $9,000m in an economy of nearly $400 billion. That gives some idea in broad terms, on the back of an envelope, of just how insignificant the sales tax is in terms of the total economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury has done an econometric analysis, looking at sales tax and its impact on business costs. It has come up with the conclusion that the impact is minimal. Despite the rhetoric, the hype and the noise from those opposite that somehow the sales tax is an intrusive, wide, costly tax, the Treasury econometric model points out that it has a very minimal impact on business inputs, it has a minimal impact on exports and it certainly does not lead to significant distortions between sectors of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury model looked at 109 different industry categories in Australia and, overall, it identified that the present sales tax added less than 2 per cent to the cost of business inputs. So it added less than one-fiftieth to the cost of business inputs. Very few sectors were above the 2 per cent average. Certainly, all parts of manufacturing that were looked at in the Treasury model had an extra impact on costs of below 2 per cent. With regard to exports, despite the rhetoric of the Liberals and the claims that somehow sales tax punishes exports, the Treasury model showed very clearly that the sales tax added only about 1 1/4 per cent to input costs into export products. So it is not a draconian tax; sales tax adds in only a minor way to the cost of business inputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the best way to help Australian business compete is to reform the existing Australian tax system&mdash;to review the system regularly, to examine it and to reform the existing system where necessary. That is the simplest way to go. We do not need a new tax in Australia, we do not need a new tax to help the export sector and we do not need a value added tax. The best way to reform taxes in Australia is to reform the existing tax system.

Of course, I will want to make a few general points in that debate as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us today arises from the March industry statement. It has taken nine months for the Senate to see this legislation, which is backdated to 12 March. The Bill has two purposes: firstly, to broaden considerably the existing sales tax exemptions which are enjoyed by manufacturing, mining and primary production businesses in respect of business inputs; and, secondly, it substantially addresses the legitimate criticism that the wholesale sales tax imposes an uncompetitive cost burden on businesses relative to imports from countries which levy a goods and services tax which zero rates exports from those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to say that we have to demolish the whole wholesale sales tax regime to deal with that legitimate criticism. There are a number of aspects about a wholesale sales tax which, in fact, are appealing. Senator Maguire has pointed to some of them. The collection of wholesale sales tax is very efficient because there are only 70,000 registered taxpayers. This means that the great majority of small businesses do not have to register&mdash;</PARA>

The majority of small businesses do not have to register with the Commissioner of Taxation and, thus, are not burdened by the large compliance load which a universal goods and services tax would impose. In addition to the compliance costs which a GST would impose on the business sector, the administrative load on the Tax Office will increase enormously. This will simply mean more of those dreaded public servants. This is acknowledged in the Fightback document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the uniformity and breadth of the tax base seems to have consumed the Opposition. It is saying that even the necessities of life must be taxed so as to keep the GST system simple. Simplicity is everything. At the same time, the Opposition is proposing an incredibly complex set of supposedly compensatory taxation measures. The Democrats say that if a GST is to be implemented, equity requires compensatory arrangements. We have the usual trade-off between equity and, in the Opposition's case, simplicity. For the Democrats, equity should prevail. This is exactly the position we have taken with regard to taxing the necessities of life. The zero rating of food will make a GST more complex than it otherwise would be. However, the Democrats argue that the costs of such a change are more than outweighed by the obvious fairness. </PARA>

Exemption will be extended to goods used in production related to activities such as research and development or engineering and technical design of goods or production processes. I presume that this will cover the design and installation of energy efficiency measures. I ask Senator McMullan to confirm this for the Senate. Other production related activities to benefit from exemption will be mine site rehabilitation; the transport of goods by rail, pipeline or conveyor between production premises; certain storage facilities and ports; and other ancillary activities which affect the efficiency of the production process, such as the training of production staff, accident prevention, pollution control, lighting or cleaning of production premises and the scheduling or costing of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also grants an exemption to research and development entities, such as cooperative research centres, where they are involved in researching or developing new or improved Australian goods or production processes. What is wrong with that? It is a good idea. Sea cargo and international air cargo handlers will also receive exemption for goods used in cargo handling and for ancillary and supporting activities. Subcontractors will be entitled to an exemption for equipment where the goods producer would have been entitled had it purchased the equipment, thereby expanding and clarifying the exemption regime which applies to subcontractors. This will simplify the substitution of subcontractors into the production process, where the producer wishes to do that, by removing the sales tax penalty which would otherwise have applied in some circumstances. This is what the Opposition wants, but it says that it will arrive at this point by another means. This will thereby assist some firms to maximise efficiency. The Democrats support this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, certain other items are to be made exempt from sales tax by removing the current restriction on their being exempt, even though they are used in qualifying circumstances. There are three categories of these goods: lubricants, motor vehicles when used within or between contiguous production premises, and general office equipment and consumables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This last category of items brings me to a disagreement which the Democrats have with the proposal contained within the legislation. In general, the allowance of an exemption in respect of consumables used in mining, manufacturing and primary production is supported. However, we have to put these exemptions in the context of sustainable development. The Democrats maintain that certain products which are environmentally superior should be assisted via the tax system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not one word about sustainability in the package. The granting of preferential tax treatment to sustainable products or punitive tax treatment to undesirable products is an important yet under-utilised aspect of the wholesale sales tax which the Democrats support. The classic example in this regard is recycled paper. Because the Government finally picked up a Democrat initiative and used discriminatory tax policy to promote the use of recycled paper products, Australia now has a thriving recycled paper industry and a more environmentally conscious community. Senator McMullan obviously agrees with this principle, judging from the article in his name which appeared in the Sunday edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but there is an inconsistency. The article, quite correctly, points out the public policy benefits of a selective differential rate system of taxing consumption. Indeed, the Opposition's decision to increase the rate of excise on tobacco products recognises this fact anyway. Senator McMullan stated in his column:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned in previous articles that one of the positive aspects of the current sales-tax system is its ability to discriminate between items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmentally friendly products such as recycled paper and solar panels are now sales-tax exempt. This gives them a price advantage over other less environmentally friendly products.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, sustainable development is enhanced by this form of assistance and it should continue. I do not have the faith that it will continue under a goods and services tax regime. The proposed exemption in this Bill for consumables includes paper and stationery. If this proposal is enacted, it will mean that that relative price differential which applies to paper and stationery made from recycled pulp as opposed to virgin pulp will be eliminated for the very large mining, manufacturing and primary production sectors. Obviously, this will tend to reduce the demand for recycled paper products in these sectors, which is surely an unintended consequence of this legislation. If it is not, Senator McMullan is today defending legislation which eliminates the price differential he enthusiastically supported a couple of days ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with a universal single rate taxation regime, such as the Opposition's proposed GST, is that no public policy considerations are reflected in the pricing of goods. No doubt the Government will be stressing this important point in future debate on the package. But, at the same time, today the Government is inadvertently undermining this important principle with respect to recycled paper in this Bill. I think it is important that this flaw is brought to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats wish to see an expanded use of this principle in other areas. We have moved amendments in this place to exempt other desirable products such as electric motor cars, wind generators, recycled plastic products and certain aids and appliances for disabled people. Further items which should be preferentially treated include road safety equipment, such as protective airbags and child restraints in motor vehicles, and certain items of waste disposal equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In past sales tax debates we have seen the Labor Party voting with the Opposition to defeat these worthwhile proposals, but now it claims to have some credibility on this issue. The Government voted against our original proposal to exempt recycled paper and then announced it in a subsequent statement. The same principle is relevant in our recently announced decision to oppose the imposition of any tax, whether it be a sales tax or a goods and services tax, on the essentials of life&mdash;that is, food, clothing and some residential building materials. We apply to any tax regime the twin tests of fairness and sustainability. We have been consistent in this regard for more than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury has estimated that the changes in this Bill will have a positive effect on the competitiveness of Australian firms and that this will translate into an increase in exports of $113m per annum. Whilst the exact effect will only be seen over time, I do not think there is any doubt that the moves will be positive. The cost of the Bill is estimated to be $240m in the current year and $445m in 1992-93. The overall benefit to Australian business is estimated by the Treasury at over $1 billion when the flow-on of reduced costs at the various stages of the production process are taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, these measures will lead to some job generation to alleviate some of the misery caused by the Government's deliberately engineered recession. The Democrats know that placing sole reliance on private investment to produce sustainable jobs is a policy doomed to failure, especially during a period of very low consumer and business confidence. The Opposition's answer to create these desperately needed jobs is to introduce a new tax on everything and then `incentivation' will do the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tim Colebatch recently pointed out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that the Opposition's conviction that lowering income tax leads people to working harder has been proved to be sheer nonsense in both the United States&mdash;that great paragon&mdash;and Australia. He asks: `Hands up all of those who have worked harder because of the 1985 income tax cuts'. What about, `Hands up all those who have worked harder because of the $5 billion worth of personal tax cuts provided by this Government in 1989'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Opposition's neo-classical economic reasoning, we should have seen a massive outbreak in productivity and extra work effort because of those tax cuts, but at the same time the Opposition has complained in this place about what it describes as Australia's poor productivity performance during the last decade. The tax cuts have been there; it has not followed necessarily that everyone works harder because of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). We have been waiting for this Bill since 12 March&mdash;a long time&mdash;when the Government's industry statement was brought down. The Government received a lot of kudos for proposing to extend the exemption on sales tax to a lot of goods. Unfortunately, nine months down the track, we are still in the throes of putting the legislation through to be able to put those measures into place. We do not know when we will get royal assent on the Bill. If that is not forthcoming until next year, quite easily 12 months will have passed since the Government's statement was delivered last March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis of the Bill is to exempt some of the production goods that used to attract wholesale sales tax. Sales tax was imposed generally in the final production stages whereas it will now be moved into the pre-production stages to include most of the pre-production costs. As the Bill says, that includes research, development, engineering or technical design which have not been there before. It also includes the production related phases&mdash;ordering of goods, controlling of the cost production process and maintaining the environment around new activities. The Australian Democrats have made a big play about the environment. Damage to the environment has come from expanded mining activities. Now that we have a corporate tax on gold production, it is only right that these sorts of measures be extended to the goldmining industry in order to rehabilitate sites. Incidentally, the mining industry is doing it much better than the Democrats in this place or any other place might think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been quite a few changes in the post-production stage, including storage, handling and dispatch. Transport is mentioned as one of the measures. An important change is the sales tax exemption on transport of goods by rail, pipeline or conveyor between production premises, but not on the transport that leaves the premises, which in the present situation is only right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest step forward on primary industry is to reverse the decision imposed by Senator Peter Walsh in his capacity as the Minister for Finance some years ago. There was a sales tax put on lubricants used in the rural industry. That tax was put in place only recently, in 1985. I saw no rationale for it at the time because some lubricants were included and some were not. If one had a loader, a tractor or something similar, the lubricant in the engine was not exempt whereas the lubricant in the transmission&mdash;about 10 centimetres to the rear of the engine&mdash;was exempt. There were stupid anomalies like that all over the place. It is time the Government got rid of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh's rationale at the time was that that lubricant&mdash;diesel or engine oil&mdash;could be used in another vehicle. In my experience, if one uses that sort of oil left, right and centre in an ordinary petrol engine car, not only will the vehicle start burning oil but also it will smoke the streets out. This exemption has also been extended to consumables, office furniture and road vehicles used only on site. Road vehicles that are used on a farming site have been exempt for quite a long time. The four-wheel drive version with table top carriers have been there a long time. But it is certainly time it was extended to mining sites. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the comments made by former Prime Minister Whitlam about the Hawke Government's foreign policy that Prime Minister Hawke is `a media and poll driven politician' whose `performances for domestic consumption have made it impossible for him to visit China, Malaysia and Fiji' and that, despite his speed on the phone to President Bush, he is unable to directly contact the President of a neighbouring country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of fact that Gough Whitlam himself established a very good relationship with the Indonesian Government and had a strong personal relationship with President Suharto. That was of general benefit to Australia and to Gough Whitlam's credit. However, it has also to be acknowledged that there are limits to the extent to which that kind of personal relationship can produce results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Whitlam, after all, has told us constantly that his own attitude towards the East Timorese question was one of very strong support for an act of self-determination and very strong resistance&mdash;a very strong opposition&mdash;to any use of force by Indonesia in East Timor. Manifestly, all the personal relationships in the world that might have existed between Mr Whitlam and President Suharto did not stop the annexation of East Timor by Indonesia occurring without any act of self-determination and with the use of force. I think that is a healthy corrective to any suggestion that personal relationships by themselves can achieve miracles when other dynamics are at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Hawke himself has shown very strong, very close, very substantial and a very continuing personal interest in the development of the bilateral relationship. His very first overseas visit as Prime Minister included a visit to Indonesia. There have been many instances since when he has tried to find holes in his program to take forward that personal relationship and, of course, he does have another visit planned there for early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a very substantial and vigorous series of attempts to build a broad-ranging relationship between the two countries in a variety of ways that I have often spelt out on the record before.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article to which Senator Loosley refers. The information which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>'s investigation purports to reveal has been on the public record for some time, not least as a result of answers which I gave to questions in the Senate in June of this year. There have been discussions since late 1990 between Australian and Indonesian officials on a nuclear science and technology cooperation agreement. The objective of such an agreement would be to enhance existing and mutually beneficial scientific and technological cooperation in the peaceful nuclear field, including such areas as nuclear safety, nuclear medicine and radiation protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and, pursuant to its NPT obligations, has a full scope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency covering its existing and future nuclear activities. The agreement in question would not, if it were to be negotiated to fruition&mdash;as I have said before and as, indeed, the article itself notes, despite the misleading title &mdash;provide for commercial transfers of Australian uranium to Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibility of future commercial transfers is foreshadowed in the draft agreement, but if such sales were proposed a bilateral safeguards agreement which meets all Australia's safeguards policy requirements would need to be in place, and there have been no negotiations with Indonesia on any such agreement. In any event, Indonesia would not be operating a nuclear power plant before the early years of the next century at the earliest, and I am not aware of any current Indonesian plans for the importation of uranium for power generation in that context. Discussions on the nuclear cooperation agreement are continuing and an agreement has not yet been finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have also said before, the Government will give consideration to the steps it might take to review aspects of the bilateral relationship and bilateral contacts in the light of the outcome of the Indonesian inquiry into the killings in East Timor, but, as I have also said, it would be quite inappropriate for us to assume at this stage that that inquiry will not be a credible one. It is in that context that this proposed agreement could be looked at, like everything else, but at this stage there is no reason whatsoever to assume that it will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the article makes a series of allegations about the environmental and other risks of Indonesia's nuclear power program, in respect of which I think the following comments need to be made. Indonesia, which is facing diminishing oil reserves, has made decisions about the energy mix it needs to meet its future requirements on the basis of careful study. Australia respects Indonesia's sovereign right to make such decisions, just as we have the sovereign right to make similar decisions. I do not see such risks, as alleged, from the tightly regulated nuclear power program using the latest Western technology which Indonesia is planning, as anything like as severe or as substantial as those which were identified in the article, although there is of course no room for complacency about nuclear developments anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Australia, together with Indonesia and others, is working through the International Atomic Energy Agency to achieve the highest safety and non-proliferation standards for peaceful nuclear activities wherever those activities take place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reynolds does raise a very important matter. The High Court, by unanimous decision earlier this month, confirmed the validity of State laws which make it clear that a crime of rape can be committed by a husband in marriage. The suggested principle that a husband cannot be guilty of rape of his wife has been completely thrown out by the highest judicial tribunal in this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

Quite clearly, that simply reduces the wife to either an object of the sexual gratification of the husband or just a vehicle for the production of descendants&mdash;preferably male descendants&mdash;in that sort of society. I believe that is a totally anachronistic way of regarding the marriage partnership in our Australian society.

But if you have a tiny base you have to start from a tiny base. It is now starting to add up to something worth while. This year, for the first time since 1788, our elaborately transformed manufactures, excluding all metals, will exceed food exports. Manufactured exports, including metals, will exceed total rural exports.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Garnaut goes on to say that this increased performance has occurred against a background of very tough domestic and international trading conditions, so there is every reason to be confident that this export improvement will continue into the 1990s. I am confident that this will occur.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beginning of this trend improvement in exports of manufactured goods predates by a good number of years the onset of the current recession, so the Opposition cannot claim that these exports are all recession driven. This Government is on track to meet its Budget-time forecast of having the current account deficit come in at 3.5 per cent of GDP, a ratio not matched, I might point out, since the 1970s. Part of that resurgence in our export performance is because of the manufacturing sector.</PARA>

The amount of revenue the States derive is effectively limited by the Commonwealth's control over the maximum bed day payment made by private health insurers. Senator Herron will know that that is held at $180 per day in order to keep down premiums.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two components in the Opposition's outlays calculation. One component is the savings that the Opposition pretends will be made as a result of Budget cuts, and the Opposition assesses those savings as worth $10 billion in 1991-92 dollars. That they are 1991-92 dollars appears very clearly, for example, on page 228 of the documentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other component of the outlays calculations is the expenditure that Opposition members will be making in order, as they say, to put together some kind of a compensation package&mdash;and that includes the social security compensation package to which Senator Short refers and to which Mr Reith referred in his press release today. That benefit compensation package is estimated at $2.5 billion in 1991-92 dollars if honourable senators look at page 290 of their own documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total expenditure that the Opposition is incurring, including that $2.5 billion, adds up to something like $5.5 billion, which means that the net savings that Opposition members calculate on the outlay side are $4.5 billion. By the Opposition's own calculations, there would be $10 billion worth of gross savings, less $5.5 billion of gross expenditure, leaving net savings on the outlays side of $4.5 billion in 1991-92 dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finance, taking the outlays side of the proposed budget, worked through each one of those figures in 1991-92 dollars. It worked through the figures systematically, elaborately, in detail, for page after page on which all the assumptions are explained and all the figures are tabulated. Instead of a figure of $10 billion worth of savings, Finance produced a figure of $7.5 billion on all the bases that were spelt out yesterday by Mr Willis and in respect of which those opposite have not struck one single counterblow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the expenditure side, instead of having a figure of $5.5 billion worth of expenditure, Finance has come up with a figure of $5.6 billion. On the expenditure side there is not much disagreement with the coalition's figures; there is not much disagreement at all on the calculation of the figures on the benefit compensation package or anything else. But the net figure when we deduct $5.6 billion worth of gross expenditure from $7.5 billion of gross savings represents net savings, in 1991-92 dollars, of $1.9 billion. That is $1.9 billion worth of net savings as compared with the coalition's figure of $4.5 billion, both of them in 1991-92 dollars&mdash;in other words, a difference, a shortfall, of $2.6 billion, exactly what Mr Willis said yesterday, exactly what is on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members have become totally confused with their own figures because, when it comes to the revenue side of the whole exercise, when they tried to work out what the ultimate impact would be on the Budget deficit or surplus, year by year or in the whole period to 1999, they were not able to use 1991-92 figures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing all the revenue calculations, which do not bear in any way on any of the figures I have been using so far, members of the Opposition did use 1990-91 figures and, when they had brought the two lots together at the end of the process&mdash;their outlays side, with the savings, the expenditure and the net savings thus involved&mdash;and they married them with the revenue side of their budget, they put them both in 1990-91 dollars, a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Were it the case that such closures were to take place in isolation&mdash;that is, in isolation from the opening of other offices to replace them&mdash;then the answer to that part of the question would be yes. But that is not the case. In fact, the documents which have been used in the article are being floated around the Department for opinions; that is why they have been released. There has already been a demonstration by quite a few people outside the Darlinghurst office to protest against its closure. I understand that the recommendation for closure of the Darlinghurst office, along with the documents to go with it, will be put to me tonight at a meeting which will begin at 8.30.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, during discussions at that meeting I understand a number of proposals for the replacement of the offices which are being closed will also be put to me. In fact, the net result will be an increase in the number of social security offices. There will be an addition to that number in the next 12 months. Obviously, during a recession, when a lot more people are coming into the offices, one has to look at office accommodation. One of the big complaints we get from clients is that many of the offices&mdash;particularly those which we have occupied in years gone by&mdash;are now inadequate to deal with the number of people coming through them. That is the problem we are trying to address.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer by Senator Evans to a question without notice asked this day by Senator Short relating to the Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's claim, which Senator Evans echoed during Question Time, that compensation will cost $317m more than the estimate of compensation in the coalition's Fightback proposals rests, as I said in Question Time, on the false assumption that the Fightback estimate is for 1991-92. That is an elementary error because it overlooks the fact that chapter 10 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document proposals dealing with compensation is written in terms of 1990-91 dollars. The reason for that is that it relates to the consequential aspects of the GST and other tax changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the GST and related tax changes were all estimated in 1990-91 dollar terms, the coalition therefore took a very conscious and deliberate decision, which is spelled out very carefully in chapter 10 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> documents to also cost the compensation figures in 1990-91 dollars. It hardly requires the Department of Finance to point out that the cost of compensation would be higher&mdash;of course it would&mdash;in 1991-92 than in 1990-91 because of inflation and the blow-out in unemployment caused by the failure of the Government's economic policies. If one were to adopt that approach, then revenue from the GST will also be higher in 1991-92 than in 1990-91. It makes no sense at all&mdash;this is why we did not do it&mdash;to cost one component of the package in a later year than other components of the package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Evans has missed is that the Fightback tax and compensation costings are all in terms of 1990-91 magnitudes and 1991-92 dollars. And 1990-91 was chosen because it was the last full financial year for which all the relevant data is available. The Fightback costings, therefore, are fully consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite fanciful to suggest that there is a hole of $317m if just one part of the Fightback package is re-estimated, as the Government did yesterday, on a 1991-92 basis. If the Government would like the Fightback package to be re-estimated in the dollars of the day for 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96, then let it produce economic forecasts on which such estimates should be based. The reason we never did that was that we would have had to rely, basically, on the Government's forward Estimates, and everyone knows how dreadfully rubbery they are; indeed, the estimates for 1991-92 are dreadfully rubbery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first four months of this financial year we have had a blow-out in the Budget deficit to a figure 50 per cent higher than the Government is budgeting for the year as a whole. Who on earth in his right mind would use forward Estimates as a basis for these proposals? That is precisely what the Government is claiming we did in relation to the compensation figures, and that is precisely what we did not do for the reasons I have just spelled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that Senator Evans, the Government, the Department of Finance&mdash;whoever has been involved in this&mdash;have made a elementary error, and it is about time they acknowledged that error. It is about time they went back and had a proper look at the Fightback proposals. This is not the only error by any means in the figures produced yesterday by the Government. There are a large number of errors. But when it comes to an elementary error and a complete misunderstanding of the documentation and the concepts behind what we are doing, then I think this really takes the cake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an example of what the coalition said in its release following the comments, the statement and the documentation from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that the Government has got it wrong in a very big way indeed; in fact, it has got every element in its response wrong. If the responses are not technically wrong, as many of them are, then they are wrong because the Government has brought forward a set of wild assumptions to counter the assumptions that are behind the coalition's proposals. Virtually none of the alternative assumptions the Government has brought forward have been given any justification at all. Far from there being a $2.6 billion arithmetical hole in the coalition's proposals, there is not a one dollar hole in the coalition's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition stands full square and will not resile one iota from one dollar of those very carefully costed proposals that are part of the basis for giving Australia the opportunity to get onto a new course, giving a bit of vision and hope to people, and providing some jobs for the 1 1/2 million people out there who cannot get them at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Net Cost: $2515 million.</PARA>
<PARA>All the individual calculations throughout this document are done basically in 1991-92 dollars. Chapter 10 is certainly a discussion of quite separate issues about the particular compensatory elements in the GST package. Those opposite may well have used 1990-91 dollars for the purposes of that discussion. I have not had a chance to check that. However, in all those tabulations&mdash;the aggregates that are used, the figuring that is used, the tabulation that appears on page 230 in a little more detail&mdash;1991-92 dollars are used. It is those 1991-92 dollars for all components on the outlay side that we have meticulously and religiously compared with the true figures&mdash;the 1991-92 dollar figures that the Opposition has put and those which we have identified. When we do that exercise we come up with the bottom line figure that I have just indicated, which is $2.6 billion. According to the Opposition, it is gross savings of $10 billion and gross expenditure of $5.5 billion, giving net savings of $4.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be a further argument about the $4.5 billion because the relevant net savings on page 230 are identified as being $4 billion in round figures. I put on the record that the explanation for that difference is the treatment of a tax credit of about $500m, which we have treated as negative revenue in our accounts and which the Opposition has treated as being on the expenditure side. We regarded the tax credit, on proper accounting principles, as being more appropriately recorded on the revenue side. That is the only point where there could be any possible room for confusion. The figures as I have described them are those aggregates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our figures&mdash;Department of Finance figures&mdash;by meticulous line by line comparisons down the page, are gross savings of $7.5 billion, gross expenditure of $5.6 billion and net savings of $1.9 billion. Compare our net savings of $1.9 billion with the Opposition's net savings of $4.5 billion and we get a $2.6 billion hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if all those figures, or any component of them, were to change, we would only have a 3 per cent difference because that is the sole impact of the difference between 1990-91 and 1991-92 figures anyway. To the extent that the Opposition had done 1991-92 figurings and brought them back to 1990-91 figures for legitimate purposes, it used a 3 per cent GDP non-farm deflator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support the remarks made by Senator Short earlier so that Senator Gareth Evans might be able to understand. He usually spends his time overseas gallivanting around and, consequently, he does not have much time to pay to economics. One of the things that we made sure of in working out our figures is that we were working with figures that were concrete figures, not the guesstimates which the Government's Estimates have become. One of the reasons why it took a full 15 months before the package was brought out was that we had to wait for the 1991-92 Budget, which would give us the actuals for 1990-91.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty Senator Evans has is in understanding that we would not rely on the rubbery Estimates figures. In the draft annual reports of the Department of Finance and the Treasury, their own officers had to apologise in rather distorted language for getting their own calculations wrong. Looking at the blow-out in the last Budget of in excess of $7.7 billion, one wonders why anybody would place any reliance on the Estimates that the Government works out for its forecasted year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, as we looked at the claims against the Advance to the Minister for Finance, we saw again and again how individual government departments got their own estimates wrong. Time and again, the whole of the Government forecasting mechanism is seen to be in error. Therefore, when the Government comes back to us and is using taxpayers' dollars to pay public servants to try to work out errors in a package which is worked on factual base figures, it not only leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the ethics of doing that, but it also leaves that great gaping hole in credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot even estimate its own figures accurately, let alone try to estimate the Opposition's figures.

<PARA>Water quality in Australia, particularly in the eastern States, is a matter of major concern. In fact, the Darling system has been declared a disaster area because of the algae problem. Unfortunately, problems are developing in the Snowy Mountains that have received little or no publicity, to my knowledge, but which are revealed in the 1990-91 annual report of the Snowy Mountains Council. Page 16 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To maintain the water quality of the Scheme's storages, baseline measurements began of the nutrient, bacterial, and turbidity parameters of the major storages. Of particular concern is Lake Jindabyne where the catchment is coming under increasing pressure from subdivision and development with the associated water supply and sewage disposal problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conjunction with the NSW Department of Water Resources the Council has completed two years of a three year water quality survey of Lake Jindabyne. </PARA>
<PARA>This next part is a matter of some concern:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Results from the first year of sampling provide further evidence that Lake Jindabyne is on the verge of becoming eutrophic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Eutrophic' means being rich in nutrients and hence having excessive plant growth which kills animal life by deprivation of oxygen. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study will assess the nutrient balance within the lake and indicate nutrient loadings from tributary inflows.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the development of Jindabyne is very important for tourists and holiday purposes, but if Lake Jindabyne is on the verge of becoming eutrophic there is no doubt that serious action will have to be taken because it is a major water system. Lake Jindabyne is important particularly for irrigation and is one of the major storages in the Snowy Mountains scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the New South Wales Government in its expressions of quite proper concern about the western waterways will also take heed of this major problem. As I say, the New South Wales Department of Water Resources is involved in this water quality survey. I also hope that this problem will not lead to any further restraint on the development of the snowfields in Australia and will not be used as an excuse for blocking that development. There is no doubt that the Australian snowfields provide an enormous amenity for many thousands of Australians and also visitors from overseas. Surely there are methods which can be properly applied to ensure that these problems, particularly of excessive nutrients, can be resolved without simply blocking development. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Michael Baume has already mentioned the problems of water quality; the measurements which have begun of the nutrient, bacterial and turbidity parameters of the major storages; and the fact that results from the first year of sampling have provided further evidence that Lake Jindabyne is on the verge of becoming eutrophic. That is a concern to all. I agree with Senator Baume: I hope that people do not jump to conclusions and stop development. A couple of other points within the report on the year's highlights are that the Snowy scheme generated a total of 5,797 gigawatt hours of mainly peak load electricity in 1991 and the unit cost of production was something like 2.9 cents per kilowatt hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well to remember the AUSELGRID recommendations in the coalition's policy of combining all the electricity grids on the eastern seaboard, and even combining them in the future with other Tasmanian electricity grids so that peak loads in different areas can be utilised in other areas and there can be much more cost efficient electricity storage and utilisation. The Council is to be commended on the report. It is a pity that we have not had more schemes like the Snowy Mountains scheme on the north coast of New South Wales. Perhaps with a little imagination and a little foresight we could have another scheme like it in Australia. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is most appropriate that the annual report of the Department of Administrative Services has been brought down today, as it follows the evaluation yesterday by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) of the savings in the Department outlined in the John Hewson Fightback package. When I heard the Treasurer make his remarks in respect of the package&mdash;he referred to the Department of Administrative Services being short of $190m&mdash;I wondered what he was doing, because I could not understand just what the attack would be in view of potential savings that everyone would know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out&mdash;this might help Senator Evans&mdash;that the Fightback package, in respect of the outlays, was based on 1991-92 Budget figures. It had to be, because it would be fraught with problems if rubbery Forward Estimates figures were used. For some reason, possibly because it did not suit the Treasurer politically, he took the following view, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not sensible to base estimates of net savings on the 1991/92 static base.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone would know that of all the figures that could be used, they would be the safest. What that means is that he has ignored entirely the savings over the next three years in the major areas of Asset Services, Project Services, the Australian Property Group, plus AUSLIG and the Australian Valuation Office. Our figures and the Treasurer's figures for the non-commercial aspects of the Department of Administrative Services&mdash;that is, Comcar and the printing service&mdash;are pretty much the same. The Treasurer seems to be arguing that, with planned rationalisation of the major quasi-commercial operations of DAS, the savings outlined in the Fightback package would occur anyway and, therefore, should not be counted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted, for instance, that the business plan of Asset Services provides for reductions in excess of some 850 people over the next three years. The coalition plan provides for reductions of 900 within the first 15 months. It could well be that the Hewson coalition, when elected, finds that some 300 jobs had been shed by the Government. That in no way reflects on the integrity of our package; in fact, it enhances it. I think that should be made clear because the Treasurer seemed to indicate to the media, quite wrongly, that there were zero savings to be made between 1991-92 and 1993-94. We decided for the whole Fightback package that we would use as the base figures the 1991-92 determined savings, and if the Government is genuine in dissecting the Fightback package, it must do the same. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Bishop for her interjection. It has not done so and, therefore, its public analysis, as portrayed by Mr Willis yesterday, is fatally flawed. It is the view of the coalition that it is the role of government to acquire the essential goods and services it requires. It is not the role of government to provide those services. There is nothing wrong, in the main, with those who work in these quasi-commercial operations. Simply because of the system it is absolutely impossible for government to run efficient, viable and competitive organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to help the Government in this instance let me say that, on all empiricals, the coalition's plan is to rationalise the quasi-commercial units in the first year. In the second year, the purchases of goods and services required by government will be done in the competitive market, thus enabling those people who now work in those commercial operations to have the opportunity to take them over and run them in the private sector. All empirical studies show that by going along this route, the savings to the taxpayer vary from 20 per cent to 40 per cent&mdash;but, conservatively, 20 per cent&mdash;and the saving estimated by the coalition in our Fightback package is a very conservative 15 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA>I will comment briefly on the annual report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. Firstly, I believe that all honourable senators should have a close look at the report as it is an excellent report. It is a report on a key area of our workplace operation that we tend to neglect and forget about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this era of an international economy, it is very necessary for us to improve our international competitiveness and improve workplace skills, particularly in the area of education and training of our work force. I have mentioned that we tend to neglect to focus on the education and training of our management, particularly middle management and supervisory levels.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the interjection that I am quite right. I thank Senator Tierney. Honourable senators would have noticed that it is a board that has produced a full range of very impressive reports over the last three or four years since its inception. The report on management training provision in Australia, which follows a benchmark survey that was undertaken in 1990&mdash;the outcome of which is detailed on pages 16 and 17&mdash;highlights a number of problems that management faces in the area of education and training in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note some of the key findings that are made. For example, there are 468,000 managers in Australian firms with more than 50 employees. Many of these managers have no formal training whatsoever. One of the rather startling findings in this report is that our managers, on average, attend only four days of training per year. I think it is a national disgrace that we have been unable to improve the education and training effort amongst our management work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country there has been a great deal of criticism, particularly from those opposite, about trade union and worker practices. A great deal of effort from this Government has gone into reshaping the attitudes of the work force and upgrading the employment, education and skills formation of our work force, but very little has been said or done in the area of management training. A consequence of the benchmark survey that was carried out was that there was an Australian mission on management skills, as outlined on pages 18 and 19. That overseas mission visited some six countries over 30 days, including Japan, Europe and North America. The recommendations from that overseas mission are contained on pages 21, 22 and 23 of the report. I would certainly heartily endorse those recommendations. As I mentioned earlier, it is an area that has been greatly neglected in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A summary of the mission's recommendations is also listed on page 41. I will give a brief run-through of the sorts of recommendations that are made. Many problems are typical of the problems in education and training generally. There is the need for an integrated national approach; the need for a national awareness campaign; the need for national skills guidelines; and the need&mdash;I have already mentioned it as it is particularly important&mdash;for supervisor development. Supervisors in the work force form the linchpin between the worker, the employee and the general management level&mdash;a very important area. There is also the need for small to medium size employer fabric&mdash;unfortunately, there are a range of impediments to small and medium size business being able to participate successfully in management programs&mdash;and the need for managers as trainers and for a foundation on education, training and best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I refer briefly to the Fightback package&mdash;the `Frightpack', or the doomsday document. I have looked through this document for some comment on management training. Where is it? There is none. Management training is one of the major problems facing this country and the Opposition has totally ignored it. That is the sort of importance that those opposite place on it. In comparison, this Government has policies and positive initiatives&mdash;the minimum training guarantee levy and reports such as this, which the Opposition would not release because it plans to abolish the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. The Government's positive initiatives stand in stark contrast to the ignorance and lack of policy detail in this area from those opposite. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been prepared because of growing evidence that the quality and effectiveness of management will be critical to the success of all enterprises in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The workshop that produced this paper has aired some very important points which relate to the supply, demand and quality of management training. The skills and expertise of enterprise management will be among the most important determinants of Australia's future. As a consequence, managers will need greater access to training and development. The report states that there is need for more accessible and relevant programs, delivered by properly qualified staff, and to increase the awareness of the desirability of these management skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These goals are very necessary. Unfortunately, the identification of the issue is as useful as the paper gets. It goes on to suggest that the way forward in this area is a higher level of government intervention. This is typical of the Hawke Government's centralist thinking, which is responsible for the economic and social disaster in which Australia finds itself today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper discusses the issues of supply and demand of management training. Instead of letting capable market forces determine the provision of these services, NBEET immediately assumes that they will not work and it seeks to impose a bureaucratic national framework over the sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no need for the repressive, self-sustaining policies proposed by NBEET.

There is now a shortfall, and 30,000 students cannot get places because of government intervention and 100,000 will be turned away from TAFE. The interventionist policies of the Hawke Government in education have deprived the sector of the resources necessary to meet the demands of the community. Therefore, one can probably assume that by intervening in the management training area, it will impose restraints with similar devastating results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market forces should be allowed greater freedom. How this sector of education should be working is evidenced by programs currently being undertaken at the Northern Rivers campus of the University of New England. The stifling centralist policies of this Government are preventing this university from reaching its full income-generating potential, thereby meeting increased educational demands that are being placed upon it. This institution is working hand in hand with industry to produce a more highly skilled and better trained work force. The university has created training programs, tailor-made to client needs, ranging from associate diplomas through to MBAs covering all of the management levels of its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revenue received from these innovative programs meets approximately 15 per cent of the costs of the Northern Rivers campus. The problems exist because demand and supply have been stifled by the Labor Government. Through national profiling, a cap has been placed on the size of the courses. It is amazing that an example of a potentially efficient match of supply and demand for management training can so easily be overturned by NBEET, which wishes to continue the destructive misallocation of resources displayed in its policies when outside resources are blocked from coming into the sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report can be recommended to the Senate for highlighting the need for continuing development of management training in Australia, but also for highlighting the need to dismantle NBEET and similar bodies which do more harm than good through the Government's centralist policies. Only by giving the education sector freedom, autonomy and proper access to additional resources can it expand to meet the needs of Australians who are looking to the future for a productive and more competitive Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>I begin by drawing the attention of the Senate to the date of the signing of the AIDC accounts by the Auditor-General; namely, 12 September. That was also the date on which the accounts for the subsidiary company&mdash;AIDC Ltd&mdash;were signed. The report of AIDC Ltd, which has some private shareholders, has been a public document for some time. Despite the fact that AIDC's accounts were signed on 12 September and the fact that on 13 November AIDC Ltd announced that it had made a loss of $8.8m, it is interesting that we are seeing the accounts only today. Those dates are important because on 14 November the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in his statement on the economy and employment, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) has recorded a profit of $9.6m for 1990-91. The Corporation has asked to retain this profit as additional capital to help meet the demand for equity and new project development. We recognise that additional capital is needed particularly for new investments in resource processing. The Government has therefore agreed that the profit should be retained by the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also decided to extend the Commonwealth guarantee on the Corporation's liabilities to 1998. This recognises the importance of the Corporation's role in industry development, by enabling it to minimise its borrowing costs.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, that profit figure is totally misleading. The consolidated accounts of AIDC and AIDC Ltd, including all of the subsidiaries, amounted to a net loss of $8.9m. The figure of $9.6m as a profit is contained in the accounts as being derived from a dividend of $8.8m being paid by AIDC Ltd, plus a service fee of $1m and other bits and pieces, less a tax payment of half a million dollars. When the accounts are consolidated, there was not a profit made but, in fact, a loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In further going through the various accounts that have been furnished in the document tabled today, I think it is important to look at some of the notes to the accounts. The liabilities are very much recorded off-budget. Why is no provision made for losses which may be incurred on contingent liabilities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the dangers that we see with the practice that this Government has developed in continuing to push accountability away from the Parliament and to corporatise activities and push them off Budget is that the accountability process has broken down. The parent body AIDC does nothing. AIDC Ltd is its operating body. That is the body which has suffered the loss. Yet the Prime Minister tried to pretend that the AIDC was a highly successful government operation which had made a profit and that this profit would be ploughed back into assisting the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA>The Auditor-General's report No. 15 is an extremely important report. It is one which fills me with concern. The issue of fraud in the Department of Defence is one which I have followed for several years. I have never been entirely confident that I should be reassured by the answers I have been given by departmental officers and by Ministers in this Parliament. Sadly, in the efficiency audit which is before us today, one can see justification for my lack of confidence in those previous answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 23 of the report the Auditor-General says that the failure to update a Defence Instruction (General) relating to finance&mdash;12-1&mdash;also gives the impression that `the control of fraud is not given a high priority by Defence'. I could not have put it better myself. I have never felt confident that the control of fraud is given a high priority by Defence. I say that for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that in 1987 the Government, as Senator Tate will recall, undertook a major inquiry into the control of fraud in Federal departments. A number of recommendations came out of that, one of which was that every department should produce a fraud control plan. It took the Department of Defence&mdash;which has 68,000 members of the Defence Force in uniform and 24,000 civilians in the Department&mdash;two years to acquire a fraud control plan. One wonders what all those people were doing if the control of fraud was a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of those years the Australian Federal Police offered to provide two police officers to the Department to investigate its fraud control measures and offer advice on fraud control. It took Minister Beazley&mdash;presumably acting on the advice of his Department&mdash;12 months before agreement could be reached to allow those AFP officers into the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has supposedly been operating on a Defence Instruction (General) Finance since 1982. That Instruction (General) has come in for some pretty strenuous criticism in this report. It is true that the Defence Department has not been implementing that Defence Instruction (General). It has been saying, `That is not very relevant any more so we will just give you some administrative guidelines. Don't take any notice of the Defence Instruction (General)'. That is unsatisfactory, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders at the lack of urgency. The Federal report came out in 1987; the Department has taken until 1991 and still there has been no amendment to the Defence Instruction (General), which should be basic to any ability by that Department to control fraud. It is a department which is particularly vulnerable to fraud. After all, any department which spends something like $10 billion has to recognise that there are tremendous opportunities for dishonest people within the Department and among those dealing with the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years we have seen a number of cases where there have been allegations of fraud and where there have been prosecutions for fraud. They include relatively small matters&mdash;important, but small in terms of dollars&mdash;such as contract splitting and fraudulent tendering. There has been a case involving a uniformed officer at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> in which a number of tenders were provided, only one of which was the real tender; the rest were fakes. That is not an unusual way of defrauding any organisation that wants tenders, but it seems to have flourished on that occasion. We are not confident that that system is not continuing in other circumstances today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been investigations of the sonar contract being provided for the mine counter-measures program. There have been investigations of contracts for maintenance relating to submarines. One could&mdash;if one had the wish&mdash;go through many examples where there have been, at the very least, question marks, and, in some cases, prosecutions, resulting from alleged fraud. We should expect to see a Department of Defence that is very concerned about detection and prevention of fraud in its area of responsibilities. Yet this report from the Auditor-General is damning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence has made some general comments which cover a couple of pages of the report. I find its comments most unconvincing. I wish to put on the record some of the key findings of the Auditor-General. I mentioned the Defence Instruction (General) where there had been a failure to update the major Defence Instruction relating to the handling of allegations of fraud. There has been a need for clarification of matters concerning the operation of the Defence Force Discipline Act and its relationship to civil laws. The Department seems to have been hiding behind the High Court and its decisions and using them as an excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a fraud control plan, which comprised a brief overall plan containing a number of objectives and strategies. It also contained subsidiary plans which obviously were unsatisfactory in that they simply related to particular areas of the Department, said what was the status quo and did not either reflect corporate initiatives or provide timetables for improvement. I would not have thought that showed much sense of urgency. There is a series of criticisms about the adequacy of investigations. Cases were noted where investigations either were not undertaken at all or in various respects were inadequate, something which we in this Parliament should be very concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a finding relating to the protection of whistle blowers. This is something that a number of honourable senators have been concerned about. I have had a number of examples relating to government departments brought to my attention over the years. The Auditor-General pointed out that although Defence policy provided for the protection of whistle blowers, there were several cases where it was not apparent that Defence had acted to protect the interests of specific whistle blowers who appeared to be acting in good faith. In a case which has been before the courts in the ACT for some time we are still awaiting judgment, which has been reserved. From the information that has been available to me, I would think it was a classic case where the whistle blower appeared to be acting in good faith. I have seen other cases. The treatment of these people by government departments generally, and by the Defence Department in particular, has been totally unsatisfactory. I am glad to see that the Auditor-General has highlighted that as one of his findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the Auditor-General points out that Defence had not been seeking in all cases to obtain full reparation for defrauded moneys, particularly those cases dealt with under the Defence Force Discipline Act. That is unsatisfactory. Who makes the decisions as to when reparations are to be paid and in what circumstances? I know of occasions on which it is hard to say that an alleged offence was actually a fraudulent offence. In such cases it would appear that the problem lay more with a lack of strong and specific guidelines for the payment of money or allowances. They have not been precise enough. People have not been prosecuted and required to repay money paid to them because a case would not have been able to be made against them. I am very glad when I am able to direct the Auditor-General to issues like that. At least we are able to get the stables cleaned from inside and, hopefully, guidelines that are more specific and tougher will be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General also pointed out something which has worried me ever since I have had anything to do with Defence, and that is the terrible state of the Department's records. As I pointed out before, something like 92,000 people are employed in one way or another in the Department of Defence. Yet the Auditor-General says that Defence records are not adequate to provide reliable records of the estimated value of alleged or established frauds and that, additionally, even when a dollar value can be assigned to a fraud, this may not reflect the full cost to Defence. Of course, by that the Auditor-General is referring to implications that go beyond the actual value of the contract. This may have an impact on our defence capability, it may be that it has an impact on the progress of one of our major contracts and, more seriously than all of that, it may have an impact on the safety of our defence personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If defective parts, or inadequate maintenance, are provided as a result of fraudulent contracts with the Department of Defence, peoples' lives may well be at risk. We have had too many accidents in the Department of Defence in the past 18 months not to wonder whether fraud was ever involved in any of them. I do not want to make that allegation but it does worry me. Of course, we still do not know what has caused most of the recent accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegation of the inadequacy of the investigations is very serious. Both the Government and the Department have to give high priority to rectifying this matter. There are allegations that all aspects were not followed up, that assertions by suspects were not subject to reasonable checks, or that the matter was referred for investigation by an agency which could not be considered to be at arm's length from the matter under review. In-house investigations worry me and I have put this on the public record in the past. How can one be confident that an investigation is truly at arm's length when it is an internal investigation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fraud report that was given to the Government in 1987 recommended that smaller investigations should be dealt with in-house but those of any potentially serious nature should be farmed out to the respective agency. There is the suggestion in the Auditor-General's report that Defence has been undertaking far too many serious investigations in-house. Of course, that leads one to be concerned about whether those investigations have truly been at arm's length. And even if they have been, it is hard to be convinced when matters are discussed behind closed doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of concern is the practice of several different groups conducting the initial investigations within the Department of Defence before it is finally decided that a matter should go outside the Department for major investigation. We are often concerned whether evidence is destroyed in these preliminary investigations or whether a preliminary warning is given to offenders so that they can conceal their tracks. This is obviously a matter which is difficult to deal with but Defence must find a better way. As I say, this is really a damning report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Defence did not have a consolidated record of fraud allegations and related actions does not surprise me. But I continue to be disappointed every time I turn around and find that in some area or another of the Department's administration it has not had adequate and satisfactory records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General also said that the records held in various locations were not consistent in content and format, nor were they comprehensive in that some cases known to have been followed up were not recorded as such in the appropriate records. We can have no confidence in the record-keeping of the Department of Defence. This report by the Auditor-General is pretty typical of what we find constantly about Defence records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship between the Department and the Australian Federal Police is one which obviously has to be given more attention. On page 21 of the report, in chapter 3, the Auditor-General says that at the time of the audit, Defence had not reached an agreement with the AFP relating to the criteria and guidelines on the basis of references to the AFP. The review of fraud back in 1987 recommended that that be done. We are now five years down the track and Defence has not yet reached such an agreement with the AFP. There could be wrong on both sides. Maybe Senator Tate is prepared to take the blame for the AFP but he shakes his head and obviously does not accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of its past dilatoriness and its lack of enthusiasm for putting proper fraud control measures in place, I would be inclined to suspect&mdash;uncharitable though I may be&mdash;that the delay had been on the Defence side. That is something which has to receive urgent attention. I cannot understand what justification the Department of Defence can have when so far down the track we still do not have guidelines for referral to the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pretty clear why we do not have major successful prosecutions. As I said before, when we are looking at a budget of something like $10 billion a year, the fact that we are not seeing prosecutions and successful prosecutions on a relatively regular basis is of great surprise, and I believe that this can only suggest that the appropriate measures for detecting fraud are not in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answering this report, the Defence Department tried to suggest that the Auditor-General's report was compiled by officers without formal training in fraud investigations and that the report drew questionable conclusions regarding the quality of investigations. It is fair to say that Defence rejects that. It says that a case has not been made that its investigations are of such a quality that a major Commonwealth review is required by the AFP and the DPP. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence is unaware of any serious concerns by these bodies regarding the quality of Defence investigations. There are, as acknowledged elsewhere in Defence comments, concerns regarding appropriate jurisdiction but that is an entirely different matter.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General does not really accept the response by the Department of Defence and rejects the fact that the foundation for the recommendation for the Commonwealth review is only the judgment of ANAO officers. Those officers have taken advice widely and believe that their judgment is correct. I would be inclined to believe them rather than accept the response from the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to recommendation 18, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence arrange for appropriate specialists, such as the AFP and the DPP, to undertake a review of the quality of fraud investigations conducted by the Inspector-General Division and the Service police and to advise on the need for additional or revised training of investigators.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not an unreasonable recommendation, I would have thought. It seems to me that it could be very valuable to the Department of Defence, yet we find that it is not accepted.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Defence believes that the Auditor-General's report has drawn questionable conclusions regarding the quality of its investigations. It says that there is no need for a major Commonwealth review or for assistance in the training of its investigators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that that is standing like Canute, unwilling to recognise the reality that the rest of us are not satisfied with the priority which it has given to the control of fraud. It urgently needs to take more action. The very fact that it accepted 37 of 41 major recommendations from the Auditor-General shows that there were a lot of areas that did need attention and, because of the Auditor-General, at least those matters have been put on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, it is very hard for honourable senators to get all the answers that they would like in the most straightforward manner when asking questions either in the chamber or, more particularly, in the Estimates committees, hearings. The Auditor-General has that fantastic facility of being able to go into the Department and scrutinise the records. So we who represent the people&mdash;the taxpayers of Australia&mdash;are very much in debt to the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General goes into a department like Defence which has such a massive annual expenditure, with so many people whom one would have thought could have been put on the job of controlling fraud and preventing fraud, yet the Auditor-General finds so many things wrong. We still find the Department of Defence refusing to recognise that it needs help and that it needs to develop a sense of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report to the Parliament and I urge the Government to put great pressure on the Department of Defence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Auditor-General's report No. 15 of 1991-92 dealing with the Department of Defence once again highlights the key, indeed, the pivotal, role that the Auditor-General plays in the scrutiny of government expenditure. It further highlights the need for the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament&mdash;Reform of the Australian Audit Office</EMPHASIS> to be implemented in full.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resources that the Auditor-General is given determine how well or how badly he is able to carry out his responsibilities. The important point that was made in that report is that we believe it ought not to be the executive of government that determines the resources that the Auditor-General has; it ought to be a separate committee&mdash;which we recommended be chaired by the Presiding Officers, alternately&mdash;that determines the resourcing of this important office. We made many other recommendations, the most important one being the need for new legislation to replace the original Audit Act which the Government has said, through lack of wisdom, that it will not introduce for a considerable period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several points that I would like to speak to, some of which have already been dealt with by my colleague Senator Newman. Recommendation 23, which concerns me a good deal, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">where personnel have been found to have entered into inappropriate relationships with contactors, Defence promptly remove them from positions where they deal with the contractors, or take other appropriate action to protect the Commonwealth and to protect the personnel from the risk of being compromised by the contractors.</PARA>
<PARA>An example is cited in the body of the report at page 34 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one particular case, at a secure establishment, an individual had accepted benefits from a contractor for a number of years. Although acceptance of these benefits was inappropriate it was never proven that any fraud had taken place. Despite the questionable nature of his relationship with the contractor, the individual was not moved from a position of influence. Subsequently, the head of the unit was transferred and the individual became the principal representative dealing with the contractor on the Commonwealth's behalf.</PARA>
<PARA>For a long time there has been the mythology that somehow there was not really room for corruption in the Federal area, and that it somehow belonged in the realm of State and local government. But in an area where there is a procurement bill of about $8m a year, one does not have to be very cynical, or indeed clairvoyant, to anticipate that things go on that ought not to, and this report cites one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read that there was no proven fraud, but what about a secret commission? There are many ways in which the DPP could look at those facts and determine whether or not a prosecution ought to lie. Yet in recommendation 18, where the Auditor-General recommends that appropriate specialists such as the Australian Federal Police and the DPP use their skills to look at the area of fraud and related offences, the Department of Defence simply says that it does not accept that a case has been made out to establish that this is required. I would have thought that the item that has prompted recommendation 23, alone, sets out the need for the involvement of the Federal Police and the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, recommendation 25 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence revives the procedures and documentation associated with the payment of allowances to eliminate or minimise the scope for fraudulent or incorrect claims.</PARA>
<PARA>Defence said it would review its documentation. I would have thought that the fact that it has to be recommended that the Department of Defence carry out such a review is an indictment of all the practices that it has developed hitherto. Recommendation 26 states that Defence should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">continue to develop, and encourage the use of, analytical techniques and audit tests designed to detect the existence of, or potential for, fraudulent transactions.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought this stuff was axiomatic. A department that has not implemented these things as part of its fraud program is sadly dilatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On page 73, recommendation 35 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence develop and maintain a centralised database containing relevant details of all fraud allegations, investigations and outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I find it typical of practices that have developed not only in Defence, but also in other areas where there is no central database. We seem to have moved to a situation where there is no oversight of many of the transactions, particularly in the area of procurement where we have devolution of function. We now have people who are way down the chain of events who are not supervised in any way and yet we do not even maintain a record of where allegations and investigations are made. Recommendation 34 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence monitor all cases of fraud to ensure that full and prompt reparation, including interest on moneys, is obtained either as a result of an order for reparation or by other legal means which are available to it.</PARA>
<PARA>Where is the record of the number of the prosecutions that have been brought and the modus operandi that has been built up with the Department to ensure that allegations, and indeed, proven inappropriate&mdash;to use the report's own terminology&mdash;behaviour is dealt with, and is not allowed to recur? Recommendation 39 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence consult with the DPP with a view to finalising criteria and guidelines on the basis for the reference of matters to the DPP.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, indeed, an important recommendation. It sits comfortably with recommendation 40 by which Defence would be required to consult with the DPP to pursue possible criminal prosecution. All in all, this report does stand, as Senator Newman said, as a damnation of the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the beginning of the report, on page 6, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A figure of $800 million relating to Defence frauds has been quoted in the media by various sources. . .</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that he cannot establish a firm base for this figure. The Auditor-General understands that it is based on an approximation of 10 per cent of defence expenditure, but he says that there is no apparent basis for choosing that percentage. But the mere fact that out there, in general parlance, it is talked about that Defence is in fact ripping off or allowing the system to be ripped off to the tune of $800m a year I would have thought would have caused the Department itself to have implemented the sorts of recommendations&mdash;some of which are almost motherhood&mdash;which the Auditor-General is insisting are put into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One looks at the Inspector-General Division on page 5, where it says that there are actual cases that are being dealt with involving $2.5m and $8.3m. These figures are not petty cash; we are dealing with large sums of money. We are dealing with a very large department and, quite clearly, the method of management within the Department is totally lacking. I do not think the Department of Defence could really hold its head very high with the Auditor-General coming in with a report like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report again highlights the point I made right at the beginning that the Auditor-General is pivotal to the question of scrutiny of expenditure in the public arena. It is time this Government got its act together and introduced the new legislation to replace the Audit Act of 1901 and implemented the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee so that the Auditor-General can carry out his work. At the moment he finds he is very often fighting a rearguard action with the executive of government. That is quite unacceptable and quite inappropriate for a system of government which says, `We build in safeguards; we build in committees and offices of scrutiny to ensure that the bottom line is that the taxpayer gets value for taxpayers' dollars'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 15 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency Audit&mdash;Department of Defence&mdash;Procedures for Dealing with Fraud on the Commonwealth </EMPHASIS>can leave a reader with very little confidence that adequate audit procedures are in place for the expenditure of what is slightly in excess of $9,000m a year by the Department of Defence. I say that it can leave a reader with very little confidence simply because the data is not there to know whether the expenditure for all that money has been properly accounted for&mdash;that fraud has not taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have said, it is an indictment on the Department that has been spending relatively large amounts of money for decades now&mdash;somewhere around 8, 9, 10 per cent of all Federal outlays&mdash;not to have a system of checks and balances in place to be able to very accurately assure the Parliament and thereby the taxpayers that that money has all been properly spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In defence of the Department, certain things ought to be said. Firstly, it is a very big spending department with a very large number of accounts. It has a small number of quite huge expenditures in new capital equipment when new aircraft, new ships and things like that are bought. It has many thousands, probably tens of thousands, of accounts of a smaller nature where all the smaller items are bought in, getting down to foodstuffs for individual camps and departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second difficulty it faces is in the administration of expenditure. There are roughly 150,000 civilians and uniformed people in the Department of Defence. The number who actually approve accounts is very much smaller than that and measurable in terms of thousands&mdash;certainly not hundreds of thousands. Expenditure is approved either by civilians or service personnel. Civilian personnel&mdash;public servants&mdash;rarely have the acumen and experience in the commercial world to be alert to all the sorts of things that can be put upon them by unprincipled people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties are even worse in the case of the uniform services because they do have a very strong tradition of honour, and there has necessarily developed in the armed services a high degree of trust. That degree of trust extends not only to their behaviour on the battlefield but also to the general conduct of their daily lives in all of their activities. While I would say quite dogmatically that the level of honesty and probity within the armed services is higher than in any other large group within the community, the very fact that there is an environment where people do not suspect that somebody within their group might be engaging in fraud or fraudulent practices makes it that much safer for that fraction of one per cent that involves itself in fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been raised in the popular press and by a few sensation-seeking people that fraud is rife within the Department of Defence. The Auditor-General says that he can find no evidence at all that the popularly accepted figure of about 10 per cent of expenditures is lost fraudulently. We simply do not know. That is the difficulty with the whole matter. Even if only half that figure is correct, if $400m a year is lost in fraud, that would go an enormously long way to redressing many of the deficiencies, particularly in equipment, that the Army Reserve has at the present time. That expenditure over 2 years, if it was of the order of $400m, would certainly clean up the backlog we have on equipment for the Army Reserve and transform that ineffective body into a much more efficient and useful body in a whole variety of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to go through the points that the Auditor-General raises here, but one matter of concern to me is that the Defence Instruction (General) on purchasing and auditing has not been updated since 1982. In that period of nine years we have probably seen expenditure, at today's prices, of about $90 billion. It is a huge amount. We have embarked on some very big defence contracts in that time. At the end of 1981 we signed the FA18 contract which at that time was the biggest defence contract that had been signed. Since then we have signed the Collins submarine contract which was larger than the FA18 contract. Later we signed the Anzac ship contract. So the requirement to update procedures as incorporated in the Defence Instruction (General) has increased with the passing of the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole matter of investigative procedures is dealt with in the report. Again, it is disturbing that so little has been done on that matter. There is also the matter of liaison with the Australian Federal Police. They are only a few of the matters that have been raised in this report, but I think it is a matter of concern that so little in the way of the effective checks and balances of a modern accounting system are in place within one of the big and most important departments of State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that I cannot come to a conclusion as to the extent of fraud. I have a reasonable involvement in defence and it has never been brought to my knowledge in any conclusive way at all that there is fraud of the magnitude that would justify claims of $800m a year. I find that difficult to believe, but at the same time I simply do not know&mdash;no one knows&mdash;when the procedures are not in place and I am unable to make a judgment on that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will summarise the points I made before the lunch break. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill provides new exemptions for goods producers. It will extend sales tax exemptions to cover a wide range of goods used in production related activities, such as research and development or engineering and technical design of goods or production processes; mine site rehabilitation; the transport of goods by rail, pipeline or conveyor between production premises; eligible storage facilities or exempt ports; storage, handling or dispatch of finished goods and raw materials; work in progress or business inputs; and certain ancillary and supporting activities which ensure the efficiency of the production process&mdash;including training of staff, accident prevention, pollution control, lighting or cleaning of production premises, and scheduling or costing of production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin is the removal of existing exclusions. Under the current sales tax law, certain goods are specifically excluded from the various exemptions applicable to agriculturalists, miners and manufacturers. The Bill will remove many of these restrictions, thereby extending exemption to certain classes of goods when used in qualifying circumstances. Number one on the list is lubricants, which were exempt until about 1985. The Government thought there was too much of a rort going on&mdash;this was not a fact&mdash;so it applied sales tax to lubricants, but that has now been turned around. I am sure primary industry and the mining industry will welcome that move. The list also includes office furniture, equipment and consumables, and general purpose road vehicles when used exclusively&mdash;and I emphasise `exclusively'&mdash;within or between contiguous production premises. This morning Senator Maguire told us that the wholesale sales tax is complex, and the very small amendments we are making now will extend further the list of articles which are regarded as exempted consumables. It certainly is not a very efficient taxing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will bring some subcontractors into line with producers. Before, subcontractors, even though they were subcontracting for an agricultural producer, were not able to claim certain exemptions. That put them at a disadvantage in competition with general producers. A subcontractor will now be treated in the same way as an agricultural producer or mining producer doing exactly the same work. I agree with that move. There has been a tightening of the test on exclusivity of vehicles. People certainly cannot claim an exemption for luxury vehicles used on a mining site or farm; however, an exemption can be claimed for vehicles used exclusively on a mining site or farm&mdash;but it must be exclusively rather than primarily; and `primarily' means about 50 per cent of the time. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) agricultural operations; or</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) pearling operations.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome these extensions to the definition of primary production operations. There is also now a business test for eligibility of deductions in order to do away with hobby farms of 20 or 30 acres being set up and used as a rort to attain sales tax deduction eligibility. Over the years Senator Walsh has pointed out situations in which four-wheel drive vehicles were bought by professionals on the pretence that they were farming operators. They were often used on a 30-acre block, which to me is a very small hobby farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand&mdash;perhaps I will be told in the committee stage&mdash;why items such as telecommunications are not in the list of exclusions. I believe they should be, because these items are used in the running of a business and ought to be exempt if the industry is exempt. I know that telephones can be used for private calls, but who wants to make private calls from work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transitional arrangements were announced in the 12 March statement. Here we are in December and this legislation has not gone through; it certainly will not get royal assent for a while. Under this legislation, it may be possible to get a refund for certain goods which were bought after 12 March and which have not been used yet. I cannot see why that provision was put in. If those goods were bought after 12 March, unless the purchaser expected the Government to be much faster in getting the legislation through, they must have been bought with an expectation of using them. An example is lubricants. I think a 200-litre drum of lubricant cost the best part of $500 or $600 the last time I bought one, which was probably a couple of weeks ago, and it still had sales tax on it. Unfortunately, those things are bought to be used; but as soon as they are opened, a sales tax rebate cannot be claimed on them. The adviser for the Government is smiling at that, but can he tell me who would buy that sort of item, or any other sort of item, with the expectation of claiming a refund of sales tax after royal assent has been granted? The interest alone on a $500 item which was bought last March would hardly make up for sales tax that might be refunded. I think the transitional arrangements should not have been proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum estimates that the forgoing of revenue in a full year will be $445m in 1992-93, and that in this part of 1991-92 it will be $240m. Perhaps the Government knew when it made the announcement on 12 March that the legislation would not be put through until now. How much of that $240m would have been lost if the legislation had been brought in last March? I have calculated that about $180m would have gone into the pockets of hard-pushed producers around Australia instead of into the Government's coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government said there would have been a flow-on benefit from the $445m of revenue forgone to industries of $1 billion. From that we can say that roughly $360m of flow-on benefit to industries such as primary industry and the mining industry around Australia has been forgone, yet last March the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) took the kudos, the pats on the back, for it. Of course, that has been a mish-mash and all these things could have been served far better by the provisions in the Hewson package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest troubles with the wholesale sales tax system is the sorts of regulations and rulings&mdash;rulings which are more a splitting of hairs&mdash;on whether or not an item is exempt. I will give honourable senators one very small example: the ruling on a stock crate and transporting vehicle. These facts were given to the Taxation Office, and a ruling was made on 5 May 1988. These are the basics:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two methods of constructing articles that are commonly known as livestock carriers. The first is the manufacture of a complete unit from the wheels up including floor, sides, gates, etc. to form a single unit. This is normally referred to as a fully integrated unit. The second method involves the separate manufacture of a stock crate and a semi-trailer and the subsequent fixing together by bolting. The latter unit is sold as a semi-trailer and a stock crate and each has its own serial number. While they are normally joined together by bolting, distributors of these units consider them to be separate items.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether the distributors of these units consider them to be separate items or whether that is the ruling of the Tax Office. I move on to the description of a dolly trailer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A `dolly' trailer consists of a turntable mounted on a chassis having one or more axles with a draw bar incorporating a towing eye. It is used to attach one livestock carrier to another, e.g. in the case of road trains where a number of semi-trailers are attached to a prime mover. Where the dolly trailer is permanently affixed to the semi-trailer chassis the complete unit is known as a `dog' trailer.</PARA>
<PARA>A livestock carrier may have a road train. The front trailer, which has a stock crate on it, is hooked to the prime mover. The prime mover is not exempt. The stock crate on the front trailer is exempt, as I have read out. The trailer underneath the front crate is not exempt. But the dolly trailer, which makes a semitrailer into a four-wheel trailer, is exempt and the stock crate on it is exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have five main items: a prime mover that is not exempt, a front trailer that is not exempt, a front crate that is exempt, a back trailer that is exempt, and a back stock crate that is exempt. Can any honourable senator tell me why there should be any difference in the categorisation of any of those components for wholesale sales tax? If anyone has an argument that there should be wholesale sales tax on the whole lot, I will listen to that&mdash;although I would argue, to the contrary, that there should not be any wholesale sales tax on any of those components. The Tax Office ruled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fully integrated livestock carriers are carriers designed for attachment to vehicles. They qualify for exemption under sub-item 1(28A), First Schedule, when purchased for use in the agricultural industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think I will go any further on that point. I have explained the mishmash operation of sales tax. The goods and services system which would be in force under the Hewson package would be far simpler&mdash;contrary to what Senator Maguire said this morning. As I said earlier on, at present we have different categories of uses and different rates. Under the goods and services tax, there would be only one flat rate. I quote from our goods and services package:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multiple Rates. The wholesale sales tax applies multiple rates (0, 10, 20 and 30 per cent) to a range of goods, resulting in significant classification problems and costly administration and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet Senator Maguire said that the compliance costs only 49c per $100. But I ask him: is that 49c the cost to the Tax Office or does it include&mdash;and I am sure it does not&mdash;the cost to the primary producer, the manufacturer, the accountants or whatever?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Senator Walsh in a minute. There is no rhyme or reason why wholesale sales tax is levied at different rates. For example, wholesale sales tax is levied at 10 per cent on dishwashers, 20 per cent on school exercise books and 30 per cent on wristwatches; cotton buds are taxed but cotton balls are not; toothpaste is taxed but toothbrushes are not; above-ground pools are taxed but in-ground pools are not; and free-standing wardrobes are taxed but built-in wardrobes are not. The reason for introducing different classifications within the wholesale sales tax may have been clear when it was introduced in 1930, but I am afraid it has not been very clear since.</PARA></TALK.START>

We can see from that listing just what the problems are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Maguire also used one of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Mr Howard, to try to knock the idea of a goods and services tax. He cited the number of the page from which he was quoting. I then thought I would read Mr Howard's speech, made on 12 March 1981, just to see for myself how much of it he was quoting and whether or not he was quoting it in full. But Senator Maguire's strongest supporter, who spoke straight after Mr Howard had resumed his seat, was none other than the honourable member for Gellibrand, Mr Willis&mdash;and he has been in the news lately. I will just quote from what he had to say after opening his remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This statement must be seen as an attempt by the Treasurer to keep alive the prospect of the introduction at some future date of a broad-based indirect tax.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in trying to get the Government to adopt his position. In this statement today we see him again spelling out the advantages, as he sees them, of such a scheme and quite clearly trying to keep alive the possibility of the introduction of such a tax at a future date.</PARA>
<PARA>We are now 10 years down the track. I am glad Senator Maguire quoted Mr Howard because that gave me the idea to look up for myself what Mr Howard did have to say. And there we have it&mdash;Mr Howard had for an ally in that debate none other than Mr Willis himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, though I welcome these measures that we have gained&mdash;especially for the primary and mining industries&mdash;as I have said, the wholesale sales tax system must be a mess when, with the simple sort of amendment we are dealing with now, we have to have an explanatory memorandum of the size we have to explain it all.

I support the remarks that my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Panizza have already made and, in particular, I support the very pertinent points and examples which they have elucidated as to the fundamental difficulties with this Bill. I do agree that essentially no amount of tinkering with Bills like this is ever going to solve the basic problems we have with the wholesale sales tax presently in operation in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the basic reasons why the coalition has, as the centrepiece of its Fightback package, proposed a total abolition of the wholesale sales tax&mdash;a tax that takes from Australian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>taxpayers, including, most importantly, businesses, something like $9 1/2 billion per year. That amounts to a threefold increase in the eight years of the Hawke Government. We will replace that hidden consumption tax with a fairer, broadly based tax which we will apply equally and equitably to goods and services. I will come back to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill implements the industry statement proposals put forward by the Government in March this year. It is the Government's attempt to implement change for Australian business in order to reform that inequitable, confusing and discriminatory wholesale sales tax system to which I have just referred. But if we are looking at major reform, we would really have to call a Bill such as this a joke because it simply tinkers around the edges of the sales tax system. It is claimed to reduce tax on business inputs and to involve some simplification but, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>as my colleague Senator Watson points out, all it does is add to the confusion, complications and bureaucracy involved with the administration of the tax system. It does little or nothing to attack seriously the problem of the inclusion of indirect taxes in business inputs and, therefore, in costs of production in Australia&mdash;and that is a very important element in making Australia less competitive and less productive than we should be, both in the export markets and when it comes to the business of competing against imports in our own domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By making even more exemptions to the existing wholesale sales tax system to cover a wider range of business inputs for use by goods producers and certain other categories of persons, the Government is creating yet more confusion among business about what qualifies and what does not. Perhaps the best indication of that building confusion is the fact that the explanatory memorandum requires no fewer than 18 chapters and 160 pages to explain the changes that the Government is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill only furthers the problems of the narrowly based wholesale sales tax system. It will require further costly litigation as businesses resolve with the Tax Office where the lines are drawn between business inputs which come under these proposed changes and those in the grey areas which may or may not. That great confusion that business is faced with in the interpretation of the law is the essence of the present problems in the sales tax area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian businesses will also need to undertake the costly and time-consuming process of working out whether their goods qualify for the main use test, to which Senator Watson has referred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has to be substantiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are substantiation problems. Despite the mass of information available to the Government concerning the inefficiencies and inequities of the existing sales tax system, the Government still has not come to grips with the real problems in our tax system. Some of them were identified very well in the recent annual report of the Industry Commission. The Commission stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we must minimise the disincentives of taxes on business and individuals. Inefficiencies from taxing intermediate inputs to business and the lack of uniformity in sales taxes are but two of the issues the Commission has confronted in various inquiries. Although the sales tax system has been the target of reform, rates across goods vary from zero to 30 per cent and anomalies remain.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill of course does nothing to reduce the overall level of taxation on Australian taxpayers. It fails to widen meaningfully the narrow, arbitrarily defined and grossly inefficient wholesale sales tax. In 1989-90, the total wholesale sales tax base represented less than 40 per cent of the value of private final consumption expenditure. Anomalies and inconsistencies abound, making the administration of the tax very unwieldy&mdash;as we are all aware. In 1990, the Centre of Policy Studies stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the somewhat arbitrary pattern of exemptions, and ambiguity in definition of the point of and value of sale in assessing the tax liability, mean that the wholesale sales tax is complex, often uncertain and poorly defined.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill still allows the wholesale sales tax to penalise actively manufacturing production and all exports. In that sense, it does not go within a bull's roar of hitting the target that it was supposed to hit, according to the Government in the March industry statement&mdash;namely, removing some of those imposts on business and to make it more competitive. The wholesale sales tax remains an administrative nightmare and it falls most heavily on the poorer sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, by definition, services are still exempt from the wholesale sales tax and that omission is clearly highly regressive. Most services, particularly those which are not being zero rated under the coalition's Fightback proposals, are consumed disproportionately by the well-off. For example, restaurant meals, taxi fares, hair styling and all of those types of services are consumed to a higher degree by the better in our community. Therefore, their omission from the taxing base makes the existing base less progressive; it makes it a more regressive base than it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the changes made in the Bill, the sales tax will continue to fall heavily on manufacturing industries. Over half of the total wholesale sales tax collections come from taxes on transport equipment, household and office equipment and furniture. Many of those things would be going into the business area. Some of the other major items taxed include a broad range of printing and paper products and the like, all of which cascade through into business costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill fails to change the multiple rates of 10, 20 and 30 per cent which apply to the wholesale sales tax and which result in significant classification problems and costly administration and compliance. The cascading effect of the tax, to which I just referred, means that all categories of goods and services bear some wholesale sales tax, either directly or indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the statement that food does not bear sales tax is simply wrong. Most food is packaged nowadays and most of that packaging attracts sales tax. It has been calculated that the average indirect cost of the wholesale sales tax on food is probably&mdash;it varies from product to product&mdash;in the order of at least 3 to 4 per cent. So it is a myth to think that food and, for that matter, clothing and things that are ostensibly exempt from the wholesale sales tax or have a zero tax applying to them do not have a tax on them; that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The different rates of wholesale sales tax on business inputs distort the choice of production processes and the choice of products produced. In its 1990 study, the Centre of Policy Studies found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These distortions mean that the allocation of scarce labour, capital and other resources is changed so that the value of national production is less than it would be under a tax system which either exempted all inputs or placed identical effective tax burdens on all business inputs.</PARA>
<PARA>We still have a system of taxation which favours imports and taxes exports. It saddles Australian manufacturers with a tax system which actively disadvantages them on world markets by taxing inputs which, under most other indirect tax systems, are tax free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this Bill does nothing to make sales taxes more visible to consumers. The wholesale sales tax continues to be a hidden tax, a very secret tax so far as many products are concerned, for the sorts of reasons I have already mentioned. Because it is secret, because it is hidden, it has enabled the Government to increase it, as I say, threefold in nominal terms and by something like 60 per cent in real terms since it came to office in 1983. I bet that hardly a person in Australia really knows the extent of the rip-off because the tax is essentially hidden away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major change in the whole direction of our taxation system is needed. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in his 1984 election campaign policy speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second major challenge for our next term of office is reform and a complete overhaul of our tax system. That will be of fundamental importance to the task of national reconstruction. A thorough going review and reform of the entire tax system will be central to all our tasks in our second term.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it was not long after that that the Government had its famous tax summit in 1985. The centrepiece of that tax summit was to be the obtaining of the approval of various interest groups in Australia for the introduction of a broadly based consumption tax. The Prime Minister and the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, stumped the country proclaiming the virtues of a broadly based consumption tax&mdash;the sort of tax that is now being proposed by the coalition: a fair and equitable tax on goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the then Treasurer went to the summit, and on day one of the summit their speeches were all about that tax. But then what happened? Bill Kelty got up and said, `The trade union movement won't have a bar of this'. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So at the end of day one of the tax summit the Prime Minister called a press conference, as I understand it without even consulting the Treasurer, and announced that a goods and services tax or a broadly based consumption tax was no longer on the agenda because it did not have support.

The lack of prospects and opportunity for Australians, particularly for young Australians, is causing despair in this country today, not least for the million and a half Australians who are either underemployed or unemployed as a result of the policies of this Government.

Senator Walsh will probably say a few words on that in his contribution, but payroll tax is a tax on employment. If Senator Walsh does not believe that, he can ask any of the State Premiers or any of the people whose jobs have been lost as a result of it. </PARA>

Basically he is a very honest fellow and he did not communicate the Government's criticism of the package in the way in which the Government would have liked.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present wholesale sales tax imposes a tax on some intermediate products. Therefore, in the first instance, it imposes a tax on some business inputs, although ultimately of course all taxation falls on individuals, be they wage earners, shareholders in companies, consumers or whoever. The impact on industry of the present wholesale sales tax varies somewhat from one industry to another but it averages about 1 1/2 per cent of total industry costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value added tax&mdash;called for cosmetic reasons a goods and services tax by the Opposition&mdash;proposed by the Opposition will exempt exports from any intermediate taxation and that, I freely concede, in isolation is a good and sensible thing to do. However, the magnitude of that change is very limited since the average tax on business is about 1 1/2 per cent from the wholesale sales tax. The effect of that for exports is a little bit more than a change of 1c in the exchange rate. Obviously, a lower exchange rate helps business and exports as well. But that is only the first round effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second round effect is that this tax, on the Opposition's own admission, will push up inflation by 4.7 per cent. If everything was properly counted, it is more likely to be something above 5 per cent. But let us be very clear about this: the Opposition's proposal will push up inflation by 5 per cent. The Opposition has pledged to return all the additional revenue it gets from its value added tax to taxpayers either as income tax cuts or as compensation. So, it has closed off three years before time, three years before its assumed implementation date, the option of dealing with the inflationary impact of its value added tax by tightening monetary policy. </PARA>

It has ruled out the option of tightening fiscal policy. This leaves only one option to deal with the inflationary impact of the tax which it proposes; that is, to tighten monetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Short himself said last Wednesday, that one-off increase will be fully accommodated by monetary policy. What he was referring to was what he calls a one-off increase in inflation which will be fully offset by monetary policy. That means another credit squeeze with interest rates pushed up to 15 or 20 per cent and the exchange rate pushed up with it. This will more than cancel the small benefit which exporters will get from the first round effects of the Opposition's tax. It means another credit squeeze. The Opposition has closed off the fiscal policy option; it only has monetary policy left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did that in 1989. The Government made that mistake when, in response to the haemorrhaging of the current account deficit, we closed off the option of tightening fiscal policy and relied entirely on monetary policy. That action lay the foundations of the present recession. And you mugs over there have not even learnt from it. What they plan to do is repeat the mistake that we made in 1989. Those opposite plan to deal with the inflationary consequences of their value added tax with another credit squeeze and another recession by relying entirely on monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other alternative is that they are telling lies, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt about that. What the Opposition proposes to do is to rely entirely on monetary policy, on another credit squeeze, to repeat the mistake that this Government made in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Opposition senators remind me of Ronald Reagan because, like Ronald Reagan, they appear to lack the capacity for trial and error learning which the higher anthropoids are believed to have. I will just explain the background to that. In 1987, Ronald Reagan was still preaching supply side economics and saying, `If you cut tax rates, revenue actually goes up'. That was what he was preaching in 1980. But, of course, in the seven years between 1980 and 1987 he turned the United States from being the biggest creditor nation in the world to being the biggest debtor nation. Like Ronald Reagan, members of the Opposition appear to lack the capacity for trial and error learning which higher anthropoids have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, of course, says that it will have a massive micro-reform policy to make the economy more efficient, to make everyone wealthier, to fix up the Budget problems and so on. There is no conceivable circumstance under which that is less likely to happen than in the monetary policy induced recession which those opposite obviously plan to resort to in order to deal with the inflationary impact of their value added tax, should they ever get the opportunity to put it in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, besides not only ruling out the option of tightening fiscal policy to deal with the inflationary impact, the Opposition has also produced an assembly of alleged expenditure cuts which are supposed to cut a net $4 billion off government outlays. A big hole has been punched in that already because&mdash;instead of $4 1/2 billion, it is $1.9 billion. So there is a $2.6 billion shortfall in that. So, actually, the Opposition proposes to loosen monetary policy to the extent of $2.6 billion, or something over 0.5 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have time to go into all the details of that but I want to draw the Senate's attention to one of the more significant errors in the Opposition's mis-costing which displays either incompetence of almost unbelievable magnitude or a deliberate attempt to deceive. I refer, of course, to the Opposition counting as a saving the reductions in public debt interest flowing from a sell-off of assorted government business enterprises. That is quite a legitimate thing to do. I have no problem at all with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then on the debit side, the Opposition did not deduct the dividends forgone from the enterprises that it had already sold off. In that alone, there is $350m in the third year of the Opposition's proposal. I actually expected there to be no errors which so clearly revealed gross incompetence as that error does. Either I was mistaken in my judgment that the Opposition was sufficiently incompetent to produce a document with that sort of error in it, or it set out to deceive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of people who make up the Opposition clearly still do not understand and have no conceptual grasp of the value added tax that they are proposing. I explained to Senator Boswell in the Senate a couple of weeks ago and also in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last week, when he was complaining that payroll tax added a tax of $7 to the slaughtering and boning of a cow in the Queensland abattoirs, that in fact the $100 abattoir cost he was talking about was the value added in the abattoirs which would be taxed not at the 6 per cent payroll tax rate he assumed but at the 15 per cent value added tax rate. So, instead of having $7 tax payable by the abattoirs, $18 would be payable by the abattoirs. In last Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> Senator Boswell replied and said, `I had forgotten about the savings that would come from the package because I had forgotten about, for example, transporting the cattle to the abattoirs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider that: let us assume that it costs $10 a head to bring the cow into the abattoirs&mdash;it is not a particularly long trip; that the contractor who transported the cattle&mdash;it could have been the Queensland railways&mdash;charged $10 a head. On to that $10 they would then have to add the 15 per cent value added tax. It is true that there would be some cost reductions for the contractor if the Opposition's proposal was fully implemented. It is true that fuel would be cheaper. There would be some cost saving because some items which the contractor presently used to transport the cattle would be free from wholesale sales tax. But it is not likely to equal 15 per cent of the total charge levied by the contractor. Senator Boswell still does not understand. He still has no conceptual grasp of the Opposition's proposal and the impact it will have on business and on transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Opposition's document, which I have here. Let us clear this up. Where does the legal liability to pay the Opposition's proposed value added tax, or GST, rest? The document says, `They&mdash;' that is, businesses, `remit a tax to the Government'. Of course they do&mdash;Senator Parer knows that and Senator Watson knows it&mdash;but they can pass it on to consumers, just as they pass on wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and fuel excise. Every business passes on any tax which it has the legal liability to pay, providing it has the market power to do so. It does not make any difference what the tax is. The critical issue is the market power of the business to pass it on, not the type of tax which is levied, except that, if a payroll tax of 5 or 6 per cent is replaced with a value added tax of 15 per cent, that will impact much more severely on business. I will say more about that later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People such as Senator Boswell&mdash;and, of course, Senator Watson and Senator Parer are no better&mdash;have been conned with this slogan: business will not pay. It does not matter how we look at it; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>the Opposition's document says that businesses should remit a tax to the Government, so there is absolutely no doubt about who has the legal liability to pay the value added tax. Who pays it in the economic sense? If businesses can pass it on, it is paid by consumers ultimately, just as every other tax of this type is ultimately paid by consumers. If they cannot pass it on&mdash;if they do not have enough market power to pass it on&mdash;it is partially absorbed within the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More important than Senator Boswell's continuing failure to understand what the Opposition is proposing is a letter in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> from John Howard, who was, I understand, centrally involved in the development of this package. In his letter, he defends himself against the charge that I laid against him last week&mdash;that is, a charge of intellectual dishonesty, because he referred to the employment-destroying payroll tax while clearly implying that the value added tax proposed by the Opposition would have no such adverse consequences. He defended himself in a very limited way and to a very qualified extent. I do not have time to go into that. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not deny that all taxes, with the exception of those on economic rent and inherited wealth, have some employment and economic growth effects.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two important things about that. It is very important to have a leading Liberal Party politician saying on the public record that taxes on economic rent and inherited wealth will have no adverse economic consequences. I invite all of the members of the Opposition to endorse Mr Howard's correct judgment about that, just as he endorsed mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not the subject under discussion today. The subject under discussion is Mr Howard's acknowledgment that all taxes, with those two exceptions, have adverse effects on economic growth and employment. In other words, all taxes&mdash;with the exception of the two mentioned&mdash;before it comes to spending the revenue raised by them, are adverse to both employment and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Opposition's policy, all businesses&mdash;except for the minuscule exception of, I think, businesses with a turnover of less than $10,000&mdash;will pay value added tax at the rate of 15 per cent on the value added to the product in that business. They will pass on most of it to consumers. Consumers will pay 15 per cent tax on all the value added within the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that payroll tax will be abolished under the Opposition's proposal. It varies from State to State. Businesses with a payroll of $300,000, and up to $500,000 in some States, are totally exempt from payroll tax. It is skewed far more towards the $500,000 exemption than it is towards the $300,000 exemption. Indeed, 60 per cent of all businesses are currently exempt from State payroll taxes. That may or may not be a good thing. What is important is that the Opposition, which claims to be the champion of small business, proposes to impose on these not so small businesses&mdash;up to 20 employees&mdash;which now pay no payroll tax, a 15 per cent value added tax, which is almost a payroll tax equivalent. Now they pay nothing; under the Hewson proposal, they will pay a 15 per cent value added tax. </PARA>

Anybody who knows anything knows that that will happen. If a tax which previously did not apply to a particular class of business is applied, the business will shed labour. The tax will provide some advantage to big business relative to small business, because big business is presently penalised by payroll tax vis-a-vis small business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to a couple of other anomalies in the time I have left. The Opposition says that a compelling reason for introducing this proposed change is to get rid of high marginal tax rates. I will give the Senate one example. Because of the proposed withdrawal of the dependent spouse rebate, single income families with incomes of between $50,000 and $56,000 will face an effective marginal tax rate of 71 per cent in the first year under the Opposition's proposal. That is the sum of the 46c proposed acknowledged tax rate and the 25 per cent withdrawal for the dependent spouse allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other points throughout the income range at which the effective marginal tax rate reaches an astronomical level&mdash;if not hitting infinity&mdash;because of the sudden death cut-off points for family allowances and things such as that. It is true that the number of taxpayers actually affected by those will be quite small, because they will not know until the end of the year precisely what their taxable income is. When they realise that they are approaching the point at which this sudden death income test will halve the family allowance or cut it out completely, these people will be facing an astronomical effective marginal tax rate because of the cut-off of some of those benefits. And Senator Watson and the Opposition claim&mdash;I do not make this claim&mdash;that high marginal tax rates are a deterrent to effort! It will not be 100 per cent, not 200 per cent, not 1,000 per cent but close to infinity. That is the effective marginal tax rate that those people will be facing. They probably will not realise it in the first year, but they will find out the year after. If those opposite are in government, they will certainly hear about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say a bit more about high marginal tax rates.

They have been introduced, and nobody talks about repealing them. The Liberals&mdash;as a bit of a sop to their National Party coalition partners&mdash;have thrown in a few things about the capital gains tax. The case for doing so was highly suspect and the proposals cost a significant amount of revenue.

It would more than put at risk some of the more worthy objectives that the Opposition has in the package for micro-economic reform.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not know best what to do with people's taxes. The Government collects the money and spends it on behalf of the people. Let the people pay less tax and let them spend the money the way they want to spend it, not the way the Government thinks it should spend the money on their behalf. If we do not pander to every lobby group around about and if we get off the employers' backs, under our package we will get two million jobs by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have done an exercise on our package that picks up a single income family on $25,000 with three children. I would like to point out what that particular family gains. First of all, the family will be paying $1,185 a year less tax. It will be paying 30c in the dollar instead of the present 38c in the dollar that the Government rips off them. The petrol excise will be abolished, so they will be saving between 18c and 19c a litre on petrol. They can save $2,000, with no tax being paid on the money they would save as interest. When one of the interviewers said to the ANZ Bank, `But the pensioners and the poorer people can't use that saving credit', the spokesman for the ANZ Bank said, `It is not the wealthy people who save; they borrow and invest. It is the poorer people who save'. So they will be benefiting from this to a much greater degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular family I have chosen with children, with a dependent spouse rebate, will get an additional $300. An additional $200 will be given per family for health insurance, if those families wish to take out health insurance&mdash;and many of them do, as you know only too well, Madam Acting Deputy President. With us, they will get back $200. The family allowance for families with three children will go from $60 a fortnight to $120 a fortnight; it will be doubled by the Opposition. They will have great incentives to take out all sorts of superannuation. Incentives will be given to them. If they are young and under 35, buying their own first home, they can withdraw 75 per cent of their superannuation to buy their first home. Under the first home owners scheme, $2,000 will be given to them to compensate them for any GST on the home, and 50 per cent of the cost of building that home is excluded from the input tax. As I said, this will guarantee two million jobs by the year 2000 and at least give our children and our grandchildren some hope of being able to get a job when their times come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be abolishing seven different taxes: payroll tax, the superannuation lump sum tax, sales tax, petrol excise, the training guarantee levy, customs duty, and the coal export duty. Now the Government has picked that up. Just recently the Government made an announcement that it was going to do that anyway. It had not even thought of it until we put down our goods and services package, and the Government knows it. The Government comes along and picks up the odd little bit of detail from our package. It will not be able to pick up the lot, because our figures are integrated. But as it picks up the odd little bit, we will be reminding it daily that it keeps on pinching bits from the package that it says is so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where will we get our two million jobs from? As an example, I will refer to two of the biggest employers in my State, Tasmania. The EZ company pays $3.7m in payroll tax alone. If it is relieved of that $3.7m it will expand and more jobs will be created. Payroll tax is the largest component of our State revenue. Cascade Brewery pays $1.3m in payroll tax. Payroll tax for the whole of Tasmania amounts to $136m. Under the Opposition's policies, that amount will be returned to the employers so that they can employ more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its time this Government has introduced many new taxes and it has increased taxes that it was already collecting. New taxes introduced by this Government include the Medicare levy, prescribed payments, resource rental tax, fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax and the training guarantee levy. Those are all brand new taxes which have raised $34,582m since this Government was elected. Increases in existing taxes mean that the superannuation tax has gone up by 3,860 per cent; the withholding tax, 324 per cent; wholesale sales tax, 164 per cent; company tax, 179 per cent; PAYE tax, 100 per cent; customs duty on imports, 53 per cent. Of course there is also the debits tax which goes straight to the States. In the 1990-91 year it increased by 540 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute disgrace that taxes have increased so much and that the recession has been deliberately implemented because the Government believes it knows best how to spend the people's money. The Government has put out several furphies. We heard one today from Senator Walsh who said that a tax of 15 per cent would be placed on small business. If he has read the package&mdash;and I believe that he has&mdash;he will know as well as we do that, if small business pays 15 per cent for its inputs, it can get that back straight away. Small businesses will be able to claim that back immediately. They will charge the consumer 15 per cent and will then have to pay it back to the Government. There will be no tax increase at all for small business. There will be no increase at all for business of any description. Business will get its 15 per cent on every single input. It will get it back and it will get it back immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another furphy that has been put out by the Government is that there is presently no sales tax on food. There will be a goods and services tax on food, on what I think the Democrats call the necessities of life. They do not believe that many of the things that I am about to read out are included in the necessities of life. For instance, they do not believe that flavoured milk, biscuits, ice-cream, and fruit juices are in this category. Every single product in the supermarket is wrapped and the wrapping has a 20 per cent sales tax on it. This includes cling wrap, aluminium foil, sandwich bags and freezer bags. All those things have a 20 per cent sales tax on them. So do pet food, beer, soft drinks, and sparkling, spring and mineral water. Everything that ordinary people buy for their homes, including whitegoods, sheets, curtains, laundry powder, washing-up liquid and soap, are subject to a 20 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Opposition's proposal, all of that will be wiped. Every single bit of sales tax will be wiped. In its place, there will be one tax of 15 per cent. It will not be a straight 15 per cent on bread and butter. The sales tax on the wrapping will have gone. The sales tax on transport will have gone at each level&mdash;in the case of butter, right back to the farmer, the manufacturer, the supermarkets, and through to the consumer. The tax on the petrol that is used to transport the goods will also be wiped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) has already said that there is a 20 per cent tax on transport&mdash;on the truck, the spare parts, the tyres, the lot. Under our proposals, there will be a drop of 26c per litre in the price of petrol used for business purposes. There will not be a 15 per cent increase in the price of butter because all of the extra add on costs will be reduced. The furphy that there will be a 15 per cent tax put on everything one buys from the supermarket is totally untrue and unjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we put this package out in the beginning, we believed that the Government would indulge in fear tactics. Now, because it cannot find any hole whatsoever, because it cannot find any mistake in the package, it has gone for the fear tactics. We have had the idiotic statement from the Ministers that it is all a class war. I want to quote Mr Keating who, on 5 June 1985 at the National Press Club, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three main advantages of (consumption) tax:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful "net dividend" for distribution to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the present Government came to power, it has increased sales tax from $4 billion to $11 billion. It has not given anyone&mdash;pensioners or others&mdash;any compensation for this increase. It has not given one cent in compensation. It has supported the tax evaders and the black market economists by not introducing a GST. The Government knows it and we can only claim that it is a supporter of the black market. How many supporters must the Government have in the black market racket when it supports that industry so thoroughly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite in this chamber object so thoroughly to the black market being picked up, including those indulging in the black market and tax avoidance and evasion, because they are frightened of the tax that we are going to bring in.

So a lot of the black market will be picked up: not all of it&mdash;we are not claiming all&mdash;but a lot. At least those who still indulge in the black market will be paying some tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 has afforded many of us the opportunity to speak in favour of our proposed tax reform package&mdash;which indeed goes further than simple tax reform; it takes in other areas which are fundamental to how individual Australians live their lives. In looking at the Bill itself, I suppose there is no better illustration of why the wholesale sales tax needs to be abolished&mdash;as we will abolish it&mdash;than the size of the Bill and the size of the explanatory memorandum. It is about four times the thickness of the Bill itself, and that highlights the complexity, the irrelevance, the unfairness and the illogical characteristics of the wholesale sales tax system. One tenth of our revenue is raised by such complexities; one tenth of our revenue is raised by an illogical, inequitable tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a little earlier in this debate from Senator Walsh, who is a well-known proponent of death duties, taxing the family home, maintaining payroll tax, and wealth taxes. He is a man who is about penalising ordinary Australian families. He is the man who had the audacity to stand up and try to talk about logic and equity. His entire speech had a theme that ranged from fear to envy. The Labor Party has been unable to counter in any way the Fightback package. It has no policies of its own; it has no strategies of its own. It can only react to the strategy we have introduced and, because it does that badly as well, it means it has to revert to those age-old discredited tactics of fear and envy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this package that we will introduce when in government is based on logic and on equity. It is based on facing up to the fact that we need a fundamental shift in our tax mix. We need to move away from direct taxation to a more broad-based indirect tax system. Presently, the numbers are quite straightforward. Out of the $90 billion we raise in taxation revenue, $50 billion of it comes straight out of ordinary Australian taxpayers' pockets; that is, it is taxed at source. Then $41 billion of it comes directly from PAYE tax, with some $3 billion being made available in refunds. The remainder of that $50 billion comes from those who pay provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By shifting the tax mix to having a greater reliance on indirect tax, we are giving Australians more freedom over the amount of tax they pay. That simply means that if people buy a more expensive item&mdash;usually they buy a more expensive item because they have more disposable cash&mdash;then they will pay more tax. If they choose, when they go to the supermarket, to buy a lower priced item, then they will pay lower tax on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not so with the present tax system. We raise $10 billion from wholesale sales tax, and this in turn has an effect on savings. The tax is hidden. As I have said often before, it is the Government's own GST, the Government's secret tax, because people did not know until this debate began that they were paying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting result of some of the research into the wholesale sales tax that the Tax Office itself commissioned&mdash;it is well to remember that it chose to spend $750,000 of taxpayers' money to get reports and surveys on the wholesale sales tax, never having done it before&mdash;is that it said, `The whole system needs to go. It is not good enough to tinker with it. It is an unsatisfactory system'. Hopefully, the Government may at the end of the day finally listen to the advice that it got after spending three quarters of a million dollars of taxpayers' money, but I would not hold my breath because this Government is locked into lethargy; it is paralysed in terms of policy-making; it does not even know where its leadership is. It spends its entire time in meetings&mdash;as it did apparently this morning when we had only three members of the Government in the chamber because presumably the rest of them were off having some sort of factional meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to have a look in some detail at what Senator Walsh had to say about one or two issues. Firstly, he immediately tried to say that the inflationary impact, which we have calculated at 4.4 per cent&mdash;a conservative estimate and not applying the non-farm price deflator, simply leaving it as 4.4 per cent but discounting 0.3 per cent for tobacco excise&mdash;would be over 5 per cent. There was no rationale, no reasoning, no backup; just an assertion. He then went on to say that the experience we have seen in both New Zealand and Canada where the one-off inflationary effect has washed through the system in four quarters would somehow not apply in Australia: we were different. He said that we had locked out the opportunity to use fiscal policy and we would be tied to using monetary policy and, somehow, by some strange quirk of his imagination, making the same error that the Labor Party, by his admission, made in 1989 when it applied monetary policy in such a way that the economy was strangled while the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, kept talking to us about soft landings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh and Mr Keating are very good, fanciful speakers. They do not rely too much on the facts but they do use the technique of repeating fallacious statements. We saw that again and again when Senator Walsh was the Minister for Finance. He would trot out an incorrect figure and repeat it so often that, in the end, some people would believe it was correct. But this time the boot is on the other foot. This time, when he tries to trot out fallacious figures, people see them for what they are. Those figures are not given any credit because people are fed up with being misled by this Government and led into hardship, bankruptcy and destroyed lives&mdash;one million Australians being unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Fightback package offers hope. It offers the proposition that says, `We are here where we do not want to be, where the economy is in a mess, and we want to be over there. Here is the plan for how we are going to get there'. In other words, the Fightback package offers both hope and a plan for how we can recover in this country increased productivity and increased standards of living and, indeed, ensure that by the turn of the century we are still a nation which is able to compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, we are abolishing seven taxes. We are abolishing the wholesale sales tax; payroll tax; petroleum products excise; the superannuation lump sum tax; the customs duties that are imposed upon such things as children's clothing and footwear with an effective tax rate of anything up to 35 per cent if expressed as a consumption tax&mdash;so much for not taxing the necessities of life; the training guarantee levy; and the coal export duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return, we are restructuring the tax system and replacing the wholesale sales tax with a broad-based goods and services tax. Our goods and services tax moves away from the concept of the wholesale sales tax which was introduced in the Great Depression&mdash;which the current recession is being likened to&mdash;when a narrow-based tax on goods was introduced to make up for forgone revenue from input duties, which of course at that stage were still running the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in those days most people's employment was in the area of making things. That is not true now; most people's employment is in the area of services. Alas, any argument that says we should penalise only those people who are making things by taxing them, as distinct from people who are in the services industry, makes no logical sense and certainly has no moral base. The reason why we give the goods and services tax its name is that it will be placed on both goods and services, so that those people who make things will not be penalised, giving those people who are in the service sector an advantage which has no moral basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think it is worth putting some figures on the record to show the way in which the current Government has impacted on the average family. A single income couple with two children on average weekly earnings is nearly five per cent worse off than that family was just over eight years ago when this Government came to power. Gone are the days in 1984 when a family could spend an average of $17 a week on health and education; that cost is now $33 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dream of home ownership has become a nightmare for many Australians. We should bear in mind that it is that dream of ordinary Australians to have a family home that Senator Walsh and his ilk would put a capital gains tax on. That is certainly something that we would never do and have rejected. The average Australian family home today costs approximately double what it did when this Government came into office. What would have taken the equivalent of four times average annual earnings to buy now takes 5 1/2 years average annual earnings. In other words, people have to work harder and longer to acquire the same home that they could have had eight years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last eight years the Federal Government's tax take has increased by 34 per cent. Personal income tax has increased by 30 per cent, sales tax by 60 per cent and fuel tax by a staggering 189 per cent. This is a country which has been described as suffering the tyranny of distance; this is a country which has great distances to cover; yet we tax the very means that we have to cover those distances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned before, I often hear the Government ask, `Why are you going to tax the necessities of life?'. For thousands of Australian families who live in the west of Sydney, being a two-car family is a necessity of life in order to get to a job, to get about, to get to see grandparents and to have some sort of interaction with the rest of the community. What we will do by removing that excise on petroleum products is make it, on average, $10 to $11 cheaper each time that family fills up the petrol tank. Believe me, for a family struggling to make ends meet, that reduction in the cost of getting around is an enormous benefit in meeting the necessities of Australians' lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the question of baby food, which is often trotted out in accordance with that emotional response. The Labor Party would have us believe it is tax free. It is not. Let us look at the way in which it is manufactured and produced and where the inputs are&mdash;inputs for which there is no rebate or refund. Let us say that I am a manufacturer of baby food. In my factory I need a fork-lift truck to move the pallets with the baby food on them. Because it is an aid to manufacture, I do not have to pay wholesale sales tax on that fork-lift truck. But immediately my baby food leaves the factory, it goes onto a truck and sales tax is paid on the truck and fuel excise is paid on the petrol that goes into it. The cost of the baby food has already increased as we transport it from my factory to the wholesaling outlet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesaling outlet will also need a fork-lift truck to move the baby food around. It is no longer in the manufacturing sector; it is now in the distribution area. Therefore, wholesale sales tax is payable on the fork-lift truck in the wholesaling sector. When the baby food leaves that wholesaling centre it goes back on a truck, with wholesale sales tax paid on the truck and fuel excise paid on the fuel to get it to the retail outlet, where it is stored on shelves and dealt with in a host of ways on which, again, there is an impact of wholesale sales tax. We have not even talked about the more important impact of payroll tax which, in turn, contributes to the cost of that baby food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated by one of the organisations which represents supermarket owners that, when our package is introduced, far from there being a negative impact on the consumer, it is likely that the overall bill to be paid on leaving a supermarket could reduce by five per cent because of the collective abolition of taxes and because of the overall benefit that is gained from the mix of products bought. For instance, on Coca-Cola we presently pay 20 per cent tax. That is an interesting story on its own, because if we buy still spring water we pay none, even if it is imported. If we buy orange juice, we pay tax; if we buy Kleenex tissues, or any other brand, we pay tax. A whole range of things, such as detergent and toothpaste, are already taxed at the ordinary rate. So the statement that the overall bill can reduce by some $5 is a reasonable one to be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax area of our package has always had three elements: firstly, to reduce the marginal tax rate and give people more control over the amount of tax they pay; secondly, to abolish the wholesale sales tax and replace it with a goods and services tax; and, thirdly, to introduce a compensation package to assist those people who are unable to benefit from the restructured tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures that we are propounding are quite dramatic, as are the cuts in the marginal tax rates. By raising the threshold from $5,400 to $7,000 it is estimated that an additional 320,000 low income earners will no longer have to pay income tax at all. The marginal rates will be cut across the board and are quite intentionally targeted at middle income earners&mdash;the same group of people that Sir Robert Menzies called the forgotten people. These are the people who have been unmercifully squashed by this Labor Government. It is that middle group of people which has been so hurt by the policies that this Government has introduced. </PARA>

When the Government comes to refute, or to attempt to refute, our package&mdash;and, as I said, the only thing it can do is try to attack it because it has no policies of its own&mdash;it does it in the face of the fact that ordinary Australians know how much this Government has hurt them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was dealing with the benefits that the Opposition's Fightback package will bring to ordinary Australian families. It has captured the imagination of Australians because it offers hope; it offers a plan; and it offers logic and equity. I dealt with the comments of Senator Walsh, who was using that well-known technique of the Labor Party: when one does not have a good argument or policy of one's own, one appeals to the base elements of fear and envy. I was reminding people that Senator Walsh is the proponent of death duties, maintaining payroll tax, taxing the family home and introducing wealth taxes&mdash;one could say a naturally taxing man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did, however, make a point relating to the question of small business, which I think I need to refute now. He was very derogatory of small business people generally. He derided a particular small business organisation, again in the way that he so often does, to play the people and not the principle. I think it was important then to understand that there was a real advantage for small business people. At the moment, if a retailer is selling products which are subject to the wholesale sales tax, it is necessary for him to raise the money in order to pay the tax at the wholesale point of sale and he does not recover that money until he sells the product. Depending upon the life of that product, it could be three months, six months or never. In the meantime, many small business people have to go to their bank and raise an overdraft, on which they are paying interest rates&mdash;which have been very high for a long period due to the monetary policy of this Government&mdash;in order to meet a bill from the tax man. They do not recoup that money. It will be either exclusive of the interest they have had to pay or their margin would have to be raised more in order to recoup that amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the goods and services tax proposal, it will be a much more equitable situation in that, because it is a value added tax where the tax is paid at every transaction, equally at every transaction a full refund is paid of the tax that is incurred on the level immediately preceding the transaction. That enables the small businessman to have those inputs relieved of taxation. To the small businessman this means that cash flow can increase. He is entitled to get his refund long before the goods are sold. So there is a boost to his cash flow. </PARA>

But we will not be dishonest in that manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking about the small business people who have been subject to the wholesale sales tax and have had to borrow money from their bank in order to pay the tax that the Government likes to impose and defend. It thinks it is a good tax. As I have said, there can be an increase in cash flow for that small business person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the other thing which is of importance to small business people is that the paperwork will be simple. We will not be reliant, as we are now, on the very wide ranging and very difficult to interpret rulings of the Commissioner of Taxation. I will give honourable senators an example to remind them how difficult these rulings are. As I said before the dinner break, if we buy a can of Coca-Cola or a can of Fanta, then we are paying a 20 per cent tax. If we like to drink natural spring water which has no bubbles, then it is tax free. If we like to drink natural spring water which has bubbles, then we pay a 20 per cent tax. If we like to drink natural spring water which has no bubbles but the label of which says it is mineral water, then we pay a 20 per cent tax. If we like to drink natural spring water which is not called mineral water but the label of which displays the minerals contained in the water, then we pay no tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we get into the wonderful situation where we can pay a 20 per cent tax on a popular soft drink that children and adults like to drink, but if we choose to drink perhaps a rather more expensive spring water that may be imported, of course we will not pay the wholesale sales tax. That is a very good example of the sheer stupidity of the gyrations that the Commissioner has to go through to make determinations. All of that will be abolished, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the issue of imports and exports, and in particular to tax on exports. Of course, this Bill had its origin in the 12 March statement. That was some several months ago. Of course, everyone will recall that the Government's idea of priority was to ban freedom of speech, so we had to have a guillotine to put that Bill through, while this Bill, which was foreshadowed in the 12 March statement, to ease the burden on exporters could go on waiting and being pushed back repeatedly because the Government clearly did not believe it to be important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, prior to the introduction of this Bill, the result of the imposition of wholesale sales tax on business inputs has in fact been acting as a tax on exports. Monash University has estimated that about 10 per cent of the wholesale sales tax or $1 billion is a tax on inputs falling on exports and is equivalent to an export tax of 2 per cent. This Bill is designed to improve that situation but does not really go anywhere near far enough to alleviate in any way some of the major problems that flow from those input taxes, which of course is the cascading effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those honourable senators who do not understand what `cascading' means, it basically means that we pay a tax on the tax. One of the fundamental and underlying principles of our tax package is that we do not have a tax upon a tax. But, in spite of the exemptions that the Government has conceded in the March industry statement, even after the passage of this Bill, there are still to be business inputs which will not be subject to the exemptions from the wholesale sales tax. That is the important point. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the most important point to emerge from this debate is that the Government is simply floundering. It is paralysed in terms of policy. It has no policies of its own. When it comes to counter the things that we say, it cannot come back and say, `We've got a splendid policy; this is what we would do'. No, Government senators have to try to find potholes or shoot grapeshot into a policy which has caught the imagination of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Gareth Evans in this chamber today. It was a delight to see him on his feet. I am sure the viewers enjoyed it. He knows so little about economics. He is very concerned about the human rights of people in places such as Cambodia and other parts of the world, but he has no concern that here in Australia his own Government is banning freedom of speech for ordinary Australian people&mdash;with the help of the Australian Democrats, of course, whose price for this was $1.8m of so-called free advertising, for which the shareholders of commercial television stations must pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans was making a rather bad fist of talking about things economic today. I was amazed that he had the audacity to stand there and defend the Government's record, saying that everything is terrific. If those opposite go out into broad Australia&mdash;and I suggest that some honourable senators who are presently on the Government benches should go out and meet some Australians&mdash;they will find that the people are not satisfied. They will find that the people hurt; they will find that one million of them are unemployed, and that family life is being disintegrated. Yet we had the spectacle of Senator Evans standing there saying, `We've got great policies, we've done the right thing, we are all terrific; and if you ever vote for us again you'll get more of the same'. That is exactly what the Australian people are saying that they will not have.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991. I begin my remarks by looking briefly at the history of sales tax in Australia. Sales tax was first introduced by the Scullin Labor Government, at a rate of about 2 1/2 per cent, in the 1930s. There were only about a dozen exemptions to the wholesale sales tax when the Scullin Labor Government introduced it. This Bill is the twenty-ninth to amend sales tax Acts in the Parliament. Therefore, something like 28 sets of amendments have come before the Parliament, and with that legislation there are two volumes of regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight the point that Senator Bishop has just made so adequately: the explanatory memorandum is more than twice the size of the Bill. It is no wonder that there is much confusion still about the wholesale sales tax regime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators opposite can parrot all they like all night; I will not take any notice of them. I wish to relate the Bill to sales tax ruling ST(NS)3005, which came into effect on 21 March 1991. My colleague Senator Panizza covered some of the points that I wish to raise with regard to this matter. This sales tax ruling is headed `Goods for Use in the Agricultural Industry'. It in fact clarified the position of agriculture in many areas. It removed a number of anomalies that existed and allowed farmers to seek exemption on inputs to production in many areas, with confidence that they were in fact operating within the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, I ask the responsible Minister: will this ruling be left in place or will it be altered as a result of this legislation? To begin with, I want to highlight what appears to be an anomaly at the beginning of the legislation. The general outline in the explanatory notes explains goods producers, cargo handling, R&amp;D activities, subcontractors, new activities, office furniture and lubricants, the main use test and so on. The section about the main use test states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new exemptions will apply where more than 50% of the use of goods is in one or more eligible activities.</PARA>
<PARA>If we turn to the taxation ruling that was put in place on 21 March this year, with regard to the definition of goods that will apply, we find the words `primarily and principally'. Once upon a time, `primarily and principally' meant more than 50 per cent of the use of the particular goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that the definition has been changed. Honourable senators on the Government benches can shake their heads as much as they like but that is precisely what it meant. Paragraph 3.12 of taxation ruling 3005 now states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Primarily and principally" means the first ranking of the possible or usual uses of the goods being considered. It is not necessary that the use in question accounts for a majority of the usage, but it must exceed any other usage.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in direct conflict with the definition of the main use test. I put this question to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is at the table: will we find that, after much negotiation by the industry to sort out the anomalies that existed in the wholesale sales tax, we will in fact have ruling 3005 amended? I think it is very important that that question be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to raise in terms of this Bill relates to the question of refund for unused stock on hand. I will deal with this a little later on in my speech. However, I find it absolutely extraordinary that in some areas if one does not use all the product that one has bought&mdash;for example, one could have 50 or 70 per cent of a drum of oil left&mdash;one can actually make a claim. Yet one cannot claim in respect of a bearing, for example, with a life expectancy of 100 hours that may have been used for an hour or 10 hours. It is an extraordinary anomaly.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be far more satisfactory and far more honest for the Government to say that a claim could be made in respect of all the items which had been bought and on which wholesale sales tax had been paid since the industry statement was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this Bill certainly seeks to remove some anomalies, we still find that a changed set of anomalies exists. Senator Panizza outlined some of these. I would like to take it a little further. I find it absolutely extraordinary that, under the ruling brought down, one can claim all wholesale sales tax exemptions on a four-wheel drive vehicle that has steering wheels and is fitted with a rear tipping tray but one cannot do so if the vehicle happens to be used as a prime mover to tow a trailer. That is totally illogical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza and I are highlighting these anomalies&mdash;I have just referred to the trucking industry but they apply to other industries as well&mdash;because they are totally inequitable and cause a distortion in the placement of investment. This is one of the principal reasons the wholesale sales tax, which has been changed over the years by 28 Bills, has to go. It creates inequities not only within and between industries but between individual producers within an industry and, as such, it causes distortion in investment patterns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reiterate my concern with regard to the taxation ruling and the main use test that has been spelt out in the explanatory notes. I have to say that I would be most disappointed if this new concept of the main use test became the definition as against what is in the taxation ruling. It would create another set of anomalies and it would create a situation whereby people in various industries, particularly agriculture, would yet again be penalised under the sales tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my further comments I would like to deal with a number of aspects as to why the wholesale sales tax has to go in order to create a much better taxation system in this country, one that encourages production and creates a situation in which our exporters are not penalised. I wish to highlight my comments and the necessity for them by referring to an answer to a question that Senator Gareth Evans gave yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recession is continuing as far as the aggregate figures are concerned. The overall GDP result in the September national accounts quarter is disappointing, but it is important to realise that gross non-farm product rose by 0.4 per cent. Obviously, that was not enough to ensure an overall net positive result in an environment where, in the farm sector, there was a full 16 per cent reduction in output</PARA>
<PARA>I highlight this answer because it emphasises how tired this Government is. The changes in this Bill emanate from a March industry statement made nine months ago. This Government must stand condemned for not having introduced those measures then. Had it done so, the disastrous position stated yesterday by Senator Evans would have been better in the non-farm sector and significantly better in the farm sector. This Government, through its discredited former Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, organised the recession we had to have, and the lack of policy initiatives and the incapacity of Mr Hawke and his incompetent cohorts to implement policy change have exacerbated it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even these changes would leave our transport industry the heaviest taxed industry in this country, and many industries carrying taxes on production that are totally anti-business, anti-production, anti-employment and, as such&mdash;to pick up the words of the failing Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)&mdash;they must be described as anti-Australian. Australia will not and cannot be internationally competitive whilst our current industrial and taxation regimes stay in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must have a taxation system based on incentive. It must give reward for effort.

It will mean that the inequitable wholesale sales tax, which is charged at varying rates ranging from 10 per cent to 30 per cent and at different levels between industries, will go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current wholesale sales tax, because of its selective application, causes distortion in investments. I want to pick up a point that Senator Walsh made. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, he tried to argue that our proposal to remove payroll tax would benefit industries paying the payroll tax and would disadvantage those which do not. That is just a nonsense argument. The payroll tax has caused a distortion in investment and it has cost employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be remembered that the wholesale sales tax targets exports and favours imports. It saddles Australian manufacturers with a tax system which actively disadvantages them on world markets by taxing inputs which, under most other indirect tax systems, are tax rebateable. Let us never forget that the man whom the Right of the Labor Party is fighting desperately to make Prime Minister after the current Prime Minister is sacked&mdash;just as happened to John Kerin last week&mdash;is that discredited ex-Treasurer Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating forced business to pay interest rates well in excess of 25 per cent in an endeavour to stop imports flooding into the country. His reliance on monetary policy and his inability to recognise that there must be incentive, reward and profit in one's industrial and taxation systems should condemn him to the depths of the pits forever. His epitaph should read, `Here lies the ex-Treasurer who took Australia's unemployment and bankruptcies to record levels'. I would like Government senators to think about that when considering this particular man for Prime Minister, which they are currently doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of the anti-employment payroll tax will give business an increased capacity to employ people and begin to grow again. The removal of the petroleum products excise will allow Australian transport industries and the producers to move towards becoming internationally competitive. There are three other taxes that we, when in government, will be removing. The seventh tax, the coal export levy, has already been removed by the Government since we announced our Fightback package. I welcome that. The removal of these taxes will all contribute to revitalising business and hence employment. They will all contribute to lifting our productivity and moving towards overcoming our current account problems. Only when we lift our export performance above our import requirements will we be able to get on top of our national debt problem and start reducing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us never forget that it has been under the Hawke-Keating partnership that our foreign debt has increased from $23 billion net to almost $140 billion net. It took 83 years for our net debt to reach $23 billion; yet in the past eight years it has increased by a further $110 billion. Hawke and Keating have mortgaged our nation. The coalition's tax reform package is designed to create an economic and business environment so that we can lift our output, reduce unemployment and become internationally competitive. Only then can we stabilise our debt and start reducing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to reiterate what I said at the start with regard to clarification of the 3.12 in sales tax ruling ST(NS)3005 which came into effect on 21 March; how that fits with the general definition of the main use tests; and how it will be administered in the partial usage of goods that have been bought in that time.

They come into this chamber and say that the coalition's wholesale sales tax, as part of the tax reform package, would put a 15 per cent tax on the essentials of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government may not be aware that it already has a 20 per cent tax on many of the essentials of life. According to this Government, it is not essential in life for people to brush their teeth in the morning; it is not important that a person can have a shave. I suppose it is great because it means that some of the Government Ministers will not be called barefaced liars. That is what this wholesale sales tax system does. The Government says, `We tax only the luxuries'. Sure, toothpaste is a luxury; toothbrushes are luxuries; razor blades are luxuries. They are the priorities of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse&mdash;what is more insidious than that&mdash;is that this Government says to us that the more of a luxury something is, the higher the tax, and the less of a luxury it is, the lower the tax. Let us examine that ludicrous proposition for a moment. It is a fact that if we buy an atlas or a street directory we pay 10 per cent wholesale sales tax. If we buy toilet paper, we pay 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. I can see the advisers nodding. This Government is saying that it is fine to buy a street directory to find where a public lavatory is but, as soon as we try to wipe our backsides, that is a luxury. That is ludicrous and the Government knows it. That shows how ridiculous this whole argument about taxes on luxuries and no taxes on necessities is. The Government does not know what it is taxing. It does not have any priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to this Government it is not an essential thing in life for us to wipe our backsides after we have been to the toilet: the Government imposes a 20 per cent sales tax on toilet paper. Goodness gracious me! Some of the honourable senators opposite ought to wrap the toilet paper around their heads because that is how poor their grasp of reality is. It really is disgraceful. That is the essence of this Government's taxation policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government Ministers who come in here parroting the lines that their faceless minders have given them do not tell us that there is a 20 per cent tax on most cars&mdash;a 30 per cent tax on ordinary family cars that most people aspire to have. They are luxuries in life. This Government does not tell us that if it had the guts to implement a tax reform package cars would be cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government does not have the guts to tell people that soap is a luxury under its regime because, again, like toilet paper, there is a 20 per cent tax on soap. I suppose the good thing about not being able to afford soap is that the smell of having not washed for a month might wipe out the fact that honourable senators opposite have not wiped their backsides in the same period either. </PARA>

After all, the man who imposed this ludicrous tax regime, the discredited ex-Treasurer Paul Keating, the now leadership aspirant, thinks he is God. What is worse, half of the people who sit on the other side of the chamber believe it. They believe that this man who destroyed this nation's economy is God. They would be willing to vote for him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people do not care whether he wants to destroy the package. They do not care whether he thinks he has destroyed the package. What the people of this country want, need and pray for is hope and inspiration. Instead, they get nothing&mdash;not a thing&mdash;from this Government. This Government is wholly incapable of even answering the breadth of vision contained in the tax reform package. It has no answer to the end of $20 billion of taxation on business inputs&mdash;no answer at all. It has no answer to an end to taxes on jobs through the training guarantee levy, which it created. It has no answer to the end of the tax on jobs through the payroll tax, which leader after leader of the Labor Party has condemned but has never had the honesty, the integrity or the fortitude to do anything about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the do nothing Government. It says, `If you do nothing and sit back, eventually people will come to expect what we have done to this country and they might be stupid enough to vote for us again'. The sad news for Senator McMullan and his lonely friend in this chamber is that the people will not be stupid enough to vote for them again. The great tragedy is that the people of this country have to wait another 18 months for the chance to get rid of them. That is what the people of this nation want; they want to be rid of this loathsome Government; they want to see it out the door; they want to see real change. But this Government could not even summon the courage to have an election, to put it to the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Hawke is so correct in saying he is Australia's mate, if he is so correct in saying, as he said recently&mdash;interestingly, before he visited Cairns, not after&mdash;that the people of far north Queensland were against the tax reform package, then he would put it to an election. He would go to the polls and say, `Fine, we'll test it'. But this is the same Prime Minister who is so devoid of integrity, so devoid of any fortitude, that he will not even put his own leadership to the test by calling a Caucus meeting on Tuesday and doing the honourable thing. This is the same man. No wonder the Australian people are sick of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing is that this man, Mr Hawke, makes wild and grandiose comments on television such as, `The tax reform package is un-Australian'. I will tell the Senate what is un-Australian&mdash;whingeing like a Pom. That is what he is doing. He is whingeing like a Pom. I have not seen him come up with one valid or sustainable alternative to the tax reform package. What did he do? He whinged like a Pom on national television. We are only waiting for his Lacoste crocodile tears to come flowing down his cheeks. There is nothing so un-Australian as a hypocrite and a whinger, but that seems to be what we are treated to by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the while we hear this rhetoric from the Government, but nothing substantial. We see this ludicrous Bill that will create provisions&mdash;and they are great. There will be a sales tax exemption, provided the item is used exclusively for, for example, primary industry. So if we buy a chainsaw and we use it to cut fence posts with, then fine, we get a sales tax exemption; but, if we also want to use the chainsaw to cut firewood, we will not get the sales tax exemption. What do we have to do? We have to buy two chainsaws. That is the logic of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, there were numerous attempts by the former Treasurer and primary industries Minister to explain the sales tax exemption on general purpose vehicles. It was really quite incredible. We get to the point where we can have a sales tax exemption for our general purpose vehicle, but we are not allowed to take trips into town to buy goods, even if they are for the property or the business, or to visit stock and station agents, et cetera. In fact, the Government even has ideas about what constitutes contiguous properties. So maybe we are allowed to drive this general purpose vehicle, on which we got the sales tax exemption, across the road from one paddock to another, but if one paddock is further than a mile down the main road from the other paddock, then there is probably no sales tax exemption. What a sack of garbage. How ludicrous can the Government get?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been suggested that there are other flaws in the wording of this Bill. One of the big eight accounting firms has suggested that the present wording of this Bill might not deliver all the things that the Government says it will deliver. That is something we might have to look at in the committee stage. At the end of the day we sit back and ask, `Why do we bother trying to amend this legislation in dribs and drabs, in bits here and there? Why do we not just get rid of it and have something new that will take the costs away from business?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the radio just the other day the head of a newly formed group called the Australian-Owned Companies Association said that one of the reasons that industry is so uncompetitive in this country is that we have so many indirect taxes which impose additional costs on business. He cited not just the wholesale sales tax&mdash;of course that is a big part of it&mdash;but also the payroll tax and the training guarantee levy which this Government has done nothing about. He said that no country with which we compete imposes any of these taxes on business, yet we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went further and talked about what a sham this Government's taxation policy has been, not for the past two or three or four years but for the past eight years. He said that when this Government purported to change company tax rates, it had absolutely no effect at all because at the same time the Government changed depreciation so that in fact there was no net benefit to business. The Government was saying, `Aren't we great, boys, because we have taken the tax off business', but at the same time it was saying, `You are not allowed to write off your purchases or depreciate your assets as fast'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if the Government gets it from the right pocket today, it will get it from the left pocket tomorrow. The thing we can be sure of is that one of these Government Ministers will have his hand in our pocket at any time. Looking at the front bench on the other side of the chamber, that is a pretty frightening thought indeed. The truth is that all across this country, the Government has its hands in the pockets of business, has its hands in the pockets of families, and has its hands in the pockets of battling Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of how highly taxed we are in this nation, an example that most people in this country will be able to appreciate. Take an ordinary truckie who owns his rig and operates it himself. He would like to say that he owns his business, but in reality he does not because every year he pays not only registration charges but also sales tax on parts and on his truck. He pays fuel tax, provisional tax and, if at the end of the day he is lucky enough to make a profit, he pays income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we add up all those taxes and put them on one side of the scales and put on the other side the amount of money he takes home to his wife and kids at the end of every week, it is clear who owns that business. It is not the truckie; it is the Government. The Government owns the profit of the business; the Government owns the profit of his labour. Instead of the poor truckie being a self-employed businessman, he is reduced to nothing but some sort of serf on wheels whose task it is to try to put what money he has back into his business so he can keep generating money to give to the Government. That is the Government's vision for a better Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Office having collected all of these taxes, the Government having put hundreds of thousands of people out of work and having closed down thousands upon thousands of businesses&mdash;you can bet your bottom dollar that every business that goes down has a large debt to the Taxation Office or has just paid a large debt to the Taxation Office and cannot pay its other bills&mdash;it is ludicrous that this Government has a Taxation Office which has on the bottom of its letterhead, `Taxes&mdash;building a better Australia'. Building a better Australia! The Taxation Office! `Taxes destroying what could be a better Australia' would be a much more appropriate logo to have on the bottom of its letterhead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we in the Opposition say is not just that we should do away with the wholesale sales tax and replace it with something logical but, more importantly, reduce the tax burden on ordinary Australians and on businesses in this country&mdash;not just to create jobs but to give ordinary Australians more of their own money back. That is a concept the Government has not grasped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I talk to a lot of primary producers. Let us talk about the end of the chain and about the primary producer, the miner or whoever who actually produces the wealth that gets processed, that is sent overseas and earns export dollars for this nation. All along the way, taxes are taken out. There is taxation on freight charges; taxation on input costs; taxation through wholesale sales tax that makes our exports more expensive at the wharf than the products of our competitors overseas. We have the only government in the Western world that is stupid enough to talk about having an export mentality and then makes our exports more expensive than our competitors before they can get off the wharves. If that is export mentality, it is a sick mentality indeed. But that is what we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens is that all along the way the money which ought to be going back to the people who produce the wealth&mdash;be they farmers, miners or whatever&mdash;goes to Canberra to support the phalanx of bureaucrats we see swanning around in the corridors. It goes to support the army of pen-pushers encamped on the fields surrounding Parliament House. The money does not go back to the people who actually generate the wealth because this Government, through its dishonest and hidden taxation system, has appropriated the wealth all the way through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be only 2 or 3 per cent or, in the case of some industries, 5 or 6 per cent, but if we add 2 or 3 per cent to the income of a country town such as Longreach, if we add 2 or 3 per cent to the income of a town such as Blackwater, which produces hundreds of millions of dollars worth of coal for us to export every year, we can see the effect clearly and palpably on these towns. But this Government cannot because it has no vision, no plan and no strategy for a better Australia. It is locked in the myopia of its own failed plans. Yet the Government persists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To try preaching to the people on the other side of the chamber is almost a hopeless cause, because they fail to understand what they are doing to this country. But we on this side of the chamber see clearly that the impost on business, the taxes on jobs, and the destruction of employment prospects for hundreds of thousands of Australians have made this country poorer. Once upon a time this country had the highest standard of living in the world. Now we are told that it has the fourth highest standard of living in the world. I spoke to a school group last year and one student asked, `If we have the fourth highest standard of living in the world, why should we worry?' I said to him, `For a simple reason: when your children come along it might be the twenty-fourth highest standard of living in the world, the forty-fourth, the sixty-fourth or the 124th'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, my job is not to come to Canberra to sit back whilst this Government destroys the aspirations of a generation of Australians. It is to come to Canberra to provide an alternative solution to the misery and despair this Government has wreaked upon us; to provide some hope; to provide some incentive; and to provide some leadership, because this Government has none. That is why it is absolutely critical that as soon as possible this nation has the opportunity to throw out this discredited Government, its discredited Ministers and its discredited economic plans, which have done nothing but reduce the standard of living of most middle and low income earners in this nation over the last eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I have great pleasure in supporting the amendment that has been moved by the coalition to this Bill and in condemning roundly a system of taxation which does nothing for business but make it less competitive, less efficient, less lean and less able to survive in the economic maelstrom that this Government has brought upon this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3), which is a very significant piece of legislation because sales tax has been crippling Australia for a very long time. The contrast between this bankrupt Labor Government and the positive program of hope that has been offered by the Liberal and National parties could not be greater. On the one hand we have some very belated tinkering with sales tax, masquerading as reform; on the other, a blueprint for change to a fairer total tax regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting to listen to the debate this afternoon, because not one speaker from the Government came up with any prospect of change, any prospect of hope or any prospect of vision. All they have done is exactly what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has told them to do; that is, destroy the package of the coalition. It is one thing for the Prime Minister to constantly repeat that he wants to destroy the package of the coalition, but does he have one continental of care for this country? He has the audacity to talk about our package being un-Australian. When he wakes up and says that his one aim in life&mdash;this is his only aim in life at the moment; obviously, his other aim in life, to retain the prime ministership, is on a short fuse&mdash;is to destroy the coalition's tax package, surely he has problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government pretends that it is helping enterprise, six months after the fanfare of the March statement, by providing some extensions of sales tax exemptions over business inputs. We honestly believed&mdash;considering that we had sufficiently flagged that we would be exempting business inputs, that people would be able to get full rebates on their business inputs&mdash;that this Government would have the courage of its convictions to say, `All right, we will gazump the coalition on this point and make sure that there is some incentive for business to produce, some incentive for Australians to buy Australian-made products and we will exempt business inputs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has the Government done? It has squibbed out. It has absolutely no courage and no ability to work out the facts of how the pieces of the jigsaw actually fit together. All that is being offered is $445m in 1992-93, a mere fraction of the $6 billion of sales tax that falls on business inputs and investment items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one of the great problems that this Government has is that there are so few people on the Government benches who have actually had to run businesses, who have actually had to employ staff, who have actually had to pay the punitive tax on employment called payroll tax, who have actually had to pay 21 days after the end of the month this dirty thing called sales tax, with all its inequities, with all its exemptions and with all its illogicality, but there is no-one over there who has actually had to run a business and do it all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take Senator Maguire, for example. He loves cheap shots; he really does. His utterances last week and today have been nothing short of amazing. But, of course, it would do Senator Maguire some good if in fact he had a real job that actually made him go and look at what makes the world tick. But no, this little charmer called Senator Maguire has been a ministerial adviser to the South Australian Premiers Dunstan, Corcoran and Bannon, and he has been a public servant in the Premier's Department. Of course, he has had prior employment in the petroleum distribution industry. I suppose that means that he was pouring petrol at a petrol station&mdash;heaven only knows. But that, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook</EMPHASIS>, is Senator Maguire's background. So the best thing for Senator Maguire&mdash;and a lot of Government senators and members&mdash;would be to get out there and try to find a real job, if anyone is game to employ him. But, of course, the reality is that they do not know what the real world dictates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When this Government claims that the overall benefits of its legislation to the business sector would reach $1 billion, it is admitting to one of the greatest weaknesses of sales tax. Sales tax, of course, is an absolute and utter contrast to the goods and services tax because it is a cascading tax which applies to goods that have already had tax paid on them. But does this Government care? The answer is no. It does not care what cascading effect a petroleum excise has. It does not care how many times people have to pay it. Therein lies the lie&mdash;the lie that is going to be told day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out in the course of the next 18 long months till this Government is thrown out of office; the lie that the goods and services tax is regressive. If there is anything regressive, it is the current taxation system of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the coalition has argued, sales tax is a concealed, insidious and parasitic tax on the economic activity of Australia because it increases the end costs of a multitude of goods and services that officially are not subject to tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, once again, let us remind ourselves that this Government neither knows nor understands how the business sector works because those opposite have not been there. They have not had to pay the wages; they have not had to pay the telephone bill; they have not had to pay the rent; they have not had to pay payroll tax; they have not had to pay the superannuation imposts that they are putting up higher and higher all the time; they have not had to pay the workers compensation bills before they have taken a dollar home for themselves. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of compensation has this Government given any taxpayer over the last decade? Not one cent. Prior to the last Budget, sales taxes had gone up by 208 per cent, yet what had this Government given by way of compensation? Not one cent. Had it increased pensions accordingly? No, it had not. Had it given tax reductions? No, it had not. Had it increased family allowances because of the 208 per cent rise in sales tax? No, it had not. Has it increased any allowances because of its greed and gluttony for sales tax? Not once. Therefore, this Government has a real problem inasmuch as it does not know what to do. It does not know how to replace this sales tax system; all it knows is that it has a real problem in trying to fight down an economic package that it cannot argue with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those opposite will do for the next 18 months is say, `You've made a big hole in the figures'.

Ultimately, the entire Australian economy&mdash;not just these 75,000 businesses&mdash;must carry the can and pay these costs.

He does not have a clue. Unfortunately, no-one in the Government has bothered to read it.

Does it ever take into account the seven taxes that we are abolishing and the $7.7 billion less in tax on inputs? No. Senator Loosley and Senator Faulkner are too interested in having a punch-up at the New South Wales State conference &mdash;or whatever it is called. Of course, Mr Keating and Mr Hawke are too busy watching each other's back and Mr Hawke is too busy sacking Mr Kerin. Everyone else is too busy waiting for Mr Howe's next gaffe.

That was a wage-tax trade-off with the political masters of this Government, the ACTU. It said, `We won't ask for a wage increase if you give us a tax reduction'. The Government cannot have it both ways.

This Labor Government has pushed up sales tax and extended it to more and more everyday items because it is a less obvious and unpopular means of tax increase than raising income tax. That is where the Government has been dishonest. It has been totally dishonest in the way in which it has pushed up taxes. If the Government kept on pushing up the levels of personal income tax in the way in which it has pushed up sales tax, it would have been out of office a long time ago. But, no, the Government says, `Let's push up sales tax by 208 per cent because not a soul will know about it'. That is right&mdash;very few do know about it.

Had taxation been subject to some honesty and indexed, the marginal rate of 38 per cent that today applies to average weekly earnings would be below 30 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In essence, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 is outdated. The Government is legislating to give effect to measures that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made in March this year. A day is a long time in politics. March is a long time ago. Since March the Prime Minister has progressively, as Senator Knowles has so ably said, lost his grip on his job. I compliment Senator Knowles on her speech. I think she has covered just about every part of the Bill, plus most of the goods and services tax which is the Opposition's tax reform package, in her speech. She has done it in a most able manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 12 March statement was another in a long line of rethinks on the direction in which the Labor Government thought this country should be going. There have been 18 major economic statements in eight years by the Hawke Labor Government, but it has still not got the direction right. That is the big concern of all people in the Australian community at the moment. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) claimed in his second reading speech on this Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures demonstrate the Government's commitment to reduce the costs incurred by Australia's goods producing sectors.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, these measures were proposed in March. Since then, bankruptcies for the September quarter were up 72 per cent on last year. Last year was a record year for business failures. That is an indictment of the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is all about reducing the costs for producers, but the Government has elsewhere shackled industry with a one per cent training levy. Sales tax is the great, silent thief. This Government just loves it. This tax has crept up over the years in a most insidious way on all people in the community. Together with fuel excise, it is the big earner for the Government. The marvellous thing about it is that no-one really knows it is being levied; it has just crept up. Any Australian that we ask will say that he or she does not have a clue what goods sales tax is applied to and how it applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the coalition has highlighted the appalling mishmash of taxes which we have in this country. One thing that really stood out&mdash;we have made the public realise this&mdash;was just how iniquitous sales tax is in this country. For example, while we tax toothpaste at something like 20 per cent, we do not tax caviar; while we tax sleeping bags, we do not tax imported suits. The system is archaic, unbalanced and unfair. A wholesale sales tax, which we are debating here, is inappropriate and outmoded. Honourable senators will remember that in 1985, Mr Keating&mdash;one of the Government's ex-Treasurers&mdash;condemned the wholesale sales tax as anomaly-ridden. There has been little improvement in the wholesale sales tax system since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst features of the wholesale sales tax is the negative impact on exports for people in the farming areas, the people who produce our export incomes. It has been estimated that over $1 billion has been added to the cost of Australian exports as a result of the wholesale sales tax of the Hawke Labor Government. There is not such a burden imposed on our trading partners. That is where the problem lies. It makes Australian exports less competitive, a fact which was acknowledged by Mr Keating only recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing wholesale sales tax system, some sectors of the economy suffer more than others. The transport and equipment sector is particularly hard-hit by sales taxes. People have not screamed about the sales taxes because of ignorance. The Government is not about to inform the public, because sales taxes have become a very handsome profit earner for the Government. Sales tax collections amount to nearly $10 billion this year. In 1983, sales tax earned about $3.8 billion. The Hawke Labor Government has turned sales tax into a tidy little earner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a couple of points about the comments Senator Walsh made earlier. He said that things would be worse under a coalition government. Let us look at what happened under the Hawke-Keating Labor Government. In 1984, the balance of payments on the current account was some $7 billion in deficit; this year it is approximately $16 billion in deficit. In 1984, Australian people were paying $35 billion to the Hawke Labor Government in income tax revenue; this year it is estimated that taxpayers will be paying about $67 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, sales tax has gone from about $4 billion to nearly $10 billion this year. When the Hawke Labor Government came to power, our foreign debt&mdash;we have all talked about this a lot in this place&mdash;was $51 billion; this year it is $124 billion. Many other things have happened, too. This year farming sector costs have doubled and income has halved&mdash;it is less than half in many places. The rural sector has been absolutely crippled by the Hawke-Keating Labor Government and the Hawke-Kerin Labor Government, and it will be crippled under the Hawke-Willis Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has acknowledged the inequity of the sales tax system. It has known for some time of the inconsistency of the schedules in the wholesale sales tax system. It has amended them several times but, as we have seen, a lot of inequities still remain. Despite the Government's 18 economic statements in eight years, it has still not been able to bring about direction for its tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the twenty-ninth sales tax Act passed through the Parliament since 1930, when wholesale taxes were first introduced into Australian law. It started, incidentally, at 2.5 per cent. Since then it has steadily been tampered with in one way or another. Twenty-eight amendments and two volumes of regulations later, it is still imperfect and the Government still has not got it right&mdash;like a lot of other things that this Hawke-Keating, Hawke-Kerin, Hawke-Willis Labor Government has not got right. It is yet to overcome its ad hoc knee-jerk approach to legislation and to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has an alternative. We have been able to present a blueprint for Australia. No longer will we have a multi-tiered discriminatory approach to taxation&mdash;an approach that has been so inconsistent and administered by stealth. We have said that we will have an up-front 15 per cent tax that is not discriminating, is equitable and applied across the board, and is not anti-business. We have had, as Senator Knowles said, a commitment by Dr Hewson and Mr Fischer that the goods and services tax will not rise above 15 per cent. They gave a firm commitment that they would resign from parliament rather than let it rise above 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales taxes we have now are borne by the 75,000 businesses that pay such taxes. Accountants estimate that business spends some $50m a year on accountancy fees just trying to get goods that have been produced subject to wholesale sales tax properly classified and to deal with the administration of the tax. At the moment they spend approximately another $50m on lawyers fees and another $400m employing people in business to administer the wholesale sales taxes. That is a total of about $500m. In my book, it is anti-business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, like the entire wholesale sales tax system, militates against export producing industries. It adds to the price of our exports, and by doing so it reduces our ability to be competitive. That is evident when one looks at the latest national account figures. We can see how desperately unproductive we have become when gross farm product slumps a massive 16.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian economy has shrunk by about $12.5 billion since the June quarter last year. Financial analysts suggest that, despite what the wishful thinkers on the other side of the chamber think, we are in a deeper recession than in 1982 and the equal of what we were in during the 1930s. Against that background what do we have? We had a sacking the other day of the messenger but no changes to the message for the Australian people. We have a fiddling at the edges of the wholesale sales tax regime when what we need is a major restructuring of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has had some eight years to get it right and it has not. I can guarantee that it is unlikely to have even another 18 months. The coalition has a tax reform package which is an answer to Australia and will put incentive and enterprise back into our economy. We have a goods and services tax package which will enable people to get up and have a go, and we have a vision for Australia.

For example, we can signal the Government's indication and support for goods that are environmentally encouraging or are in sympathy with the new thinking about the environment by reducing the sales tax there. This is an option we do not have with the flat rate of the value added tax of the Opposition, a point those opposite do not wish to talk about. Honourable senators opposite somehow suggest that it is better to have a GST than anything else; they do not argue cogently why the adjustable wholesale sales tax is so bad. I think their arguments mainly consisted of `This was really their idea and we pinched it'. Therefore they lagged it off, which is a bit of a problem. Did they not think it was a good idea when they first had it? If it was, why would they not therefore want to say to the Government, `Well done for at least developing this point.'?

They do not even know, between the two of them, whether or not there will be inflation. Senator Short actually defines inflation as the rise going on again and again. I do not know then, by definition, whether Senator Watson's one-off could possibly conform to the definition of inflation. All we know is that it will put the prices up. Whacko! You tell us!

One of the things which the Opposition's health policy does, but does not tell anyone about, is whack on costs. It puts up inflation and it will only stay up.

They are the bits of inflation that those opposite have not come clean about. They are the bits of inflation that they do not want to tell us about. They are the bits of inflation that will add to the push for increases in wages, and to the whole equation falling apart because those opposite have not factored it in. They do not want to know about inflation into the future, but it is there. It is there in just these 30 pages of the Opposition's supplementary paper No. 3 on health.

She also raised the concern about the impact of the exemption for all office equipment inputs to a goods producer&mdash;meaning that the distinction between recycled paper and other paper would disappear. It is true that, for some uses, that will be the case. But I do not think it is appropriate that we should undermine the basic purpose of making business inputs exempt in order to make a marginal extension to the proper and appropriate exemption that does apply to recycled paper. I indicate that it clearly will not affect the preferential prices of the recycled paper which is used by the service sector. So there will still be a substantial benefit to those people who are producing and distributing recycled products, as there should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza raised a question about telecommunications equipment. When I first read the Bill this point struck me; it looked unusual. But when one reads it in detail one finds that it is in fact very narrow and specific. All we are excluding in this legislation are goods that are part of the major infrastructure of a communications network, such as satellites or telephone exchanges. Things such as telephones and handsets will be exempt; the legislation applies only if one has a telephone exchange or a major piece of satellite equipment within one's operation. That is what is excluded: parts of the network as a whole which are not part of one's personal or business use. I had the same impression when I read the Bill for the first time, but, upon careful reading, I think the honourable senator will find that it applies to that narrow situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane asked me whether ruling 3005 of March will be altered. The answer is yes, it will be updated to add the new exemptions to its scope. That was Senator Crane's principal concern. I have to some extent skipped over a number of points, but I think I have covered everything that relates to concern about the meaning of clauses in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of speakers expressed concern about the size of the explanatory memorandum in relation to the size of the Bill. There is a fundamental misunderstanding about that. It is very desirable that we have comprehensive explanatory memorandums. Many users in industry and the professions have commended this explanatory memorandum, which they find particularly useful. I think that goes to the specifics of the matters raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come back to make some concluding remarks about the nature of the wholesale sales tax, the amendment which relates to the goods and services tax and the concern that has been expressed that, somehow or other, the goods and services tax will be much simpler and will eliminate cascading. I wish to quote from the Price Waterhouse document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback analysed</EMPHASIS>. It is not a Labor Party document; it is published by the tax section of Price Waterhouse. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exemptions in particular can cause major distortions in the industries in which they apply and in other business sectors dealing with those industries. . . the major problem is `cascading'.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about the operation of the wholesale sales tax and the distortions that it causes. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will not go away with the passing of the WST. The Coalition's GST proposal is far from a distortion free tax. Nor will it be without its quota of administrative complications and definitional issues.</PARA>
<PARA>The document says that the GST will be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . just as much a source of complexity, dispute and litigation as any other form of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>In New Zealand, which has a simpler system than the one proposed by the Opposition, there have already been 100 goods and services tax cases before the courts, which is as many as there have been in Australia about the wholesale sales tax in 60 years. To argue that it will simplify and take the complexity out of the system is to delude oneself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as questions of definition, exemptions, zero rating and distinctions are introduced, problems of definition and complexity are introduced. Price Waterhouse states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complexity and dispute will also be unavoidable. Anomalies also will be unavoidable.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a lot of examples, but I have time to refer to only a few. When does a service provided by a hospital cease to be a health care service? At what stage does a service or other supply by a school cease to be educational? How do we deal with goods supplied by State <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>government authorities and enterprises which may be sheltered from GST, irrespective of whether the supply would lead to significant distortions of competition? What will be the treatment of financial services that are supplied incidental to another business? At what point does an exempt financial service become a secondary financial service? How do we deal with different timing rules which may apply depending on the nature of the leasing arrangement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there will be a need to distinguish between materials used in building construction and those used in other construction. That is where we get this question of cascading. People say, `No, there can't be cascading'. Senator Bishop said that there cannot be cascading under this goods and services tax. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial services and building construction are major inputs in all sectors of the economy. The exemption of the supplies must result in considerable `cascading'.</PARA>
<PARA>For example, the report states that in the tourism industry `as building construction is exempt, tourist industry operators will be unable to obtain input credits on these supplies'. Price Waterhouse goes on to say, quite correctly, that the tourism industry `will be subject to double taxation'. For all those reasons the arguments that have been put forward about cascading are entirely wrong, as are the ones about the greater simplicity and administrative ease for business. I will quote Price Waterhouse again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major problem will be determining the GST credit where supplies are used for both business and private or exempt purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>It says that it will spawn `the most complex rules and regulations' and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant changes will need to be made to many accounting systems. . . it will be necessary to segregate and/or account for the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">taxable sales, tax exempt sales, zero rated sales, tax collected on taxable sales, taxed purchases, tax exempt purchases, untaxed purchases, imports at duty/tax paid value. . . input taxes, taxes to be remitted to/secured from the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to go on to a number of other points but I will mention only one more in the time available. People spoke of the wonderful benefits to small business because of the cash flow. Price Waterhouse point out, quite accurately, that the proposed GST will in some way affect the cash flow results of virtually every transaction in the economy. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some companies may need to borrow to meet increased working capital commitments. Others will enjoy a significant cash flow advantage.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, all I want to say is that the debate around this Bill has highlighted the first stage of a debate about competing strategies; about whether we will increase or reduce indirect taxes, the mechanism for funding government services as a means of making Australia fairer or less fair; about whether we will provide, through this Bill, assistance to industry in a manner that reduces the level of indirect taxes rather than try to do so in a way that increases indirect taxes, because that makes Australia less fair and other elements lead to the economy being less buoyant for the reasons outlined so effectively by Senator Walsh.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like Senator McMullan to respond, maybe in writing because of the shortage of time, as to why the Government has changed the definition of `mainly' from `not less than 50 per cent' to `to the extent of more than 50 per cent'. I believe this has created some confusion. I understand the significance of the words `or' and `and', but I think there is still some concern about the overlapping as a result of this new legislation between the roles of the Commissioner of Taxation and the Industry Research and Development Board. The Parliamentary Secretary might like to take that on notice. </PARA>

The Opposition supports the Sales Tax Law Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, which improves the quality of sales tax law, although, as we pointed out during the debate, it falls far short of what is required under our proposed GST legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I was not here last Tuesday evening, 3 December. Senator MacGibbon made three allegations in his speech which are inaccurate. First, he referred to page 209 of the Cooke report and a purported donation which I received from the Queensland AWU; secondly, he alleged that I received that donation because I was running for the Senate at the time; and, thirdly, he alleged that the donation was illegal. Those three allegations are incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators read page 209 of the Cooke report they will see that I received a donation from the Queensland Liquor Trades Union, not the Australian Workers Union. That is the first part of the allegation, which was incorrect. Regarding the allegation that the donation was illegal, I declared the donation in accordance with the Federal legislation with respect to the giving of donations. The next allegation made by Senator MacGibbon was that it was given to me because I was running for the Senate. Senator MacGibbon was only four years out. The donation was given to me when I was a candidate for the House of Representatives election in 1987, not in response to the last election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that a number of trade unions saw fit to donate to my campaign. I reject the sorts of innuendo that some people opposite cast that there is something wrong with receiving donations from trade unions. There is nothing wrong with receiving donations from trade unions, any more than there is anything wrong with receiving donations from business. During that campaign in 1987 I received a range of donations from business people as well. I do not have any particular problem with receiving donations from unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point is that Senator MacGibbon was wrong on three crucial points. After reading page 209 of the report of the Cooke inquiry, I do not see how Senator MacGibbon could make the three mistakes that he did. There are probably two ways we could look at the allegation that Senator MacGibbon made. One can either be a liar or not know how to read a report. They are the two perspectives we can put on Senator MacGibbon's allegation. I will leave the Senate and Senator MacGibbon to judge which one of those two aspects he was acting on when he made the comments about me last Wednesday evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise this evening is in reply to a question that I asked Senator Cook some time ago on the Moora straw based pulp and paper mill. Before I go any further, I wish to say that I advised Senator Cook's office that I would be bringing this matter up this evening. Let no one make an accusation that I brought it up without his knowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a statement tabled by Senator Cook on 14 November which purported to answer the question I had asked on 11 November in relation to the proposed Moora straw based pulp mill project in Western Australia. Gratuitous and snide comments were made by Senator Cook immediately following the tabling of that statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . perhaps Senator Panizza ought to have told us whether he is in fact a shareholder in Riverhouse Packaging, one of the shareholder companies in the project.</PARA>
<PARA>At that stage I rose on a point of order and objected, attempting to give an explanation, but the President ruled that it was not a point of order because he was not to know whether I was a shareholder or not. I accepted the ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will comment on the second point first. My only knowledge of the company structure associated with the Moora project is from newspaper reports and the statement in the letter of 31 October 1991 from G.T. Bucknall, Secretary of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union, to which was attached a copy of the executive summary of an analysis of the project by Professor John Hicks which had been commissioned by the union. We know who commissioned it but we would like to know who paid for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From those sources I understand that the companies involved in the Moora project are the Riverhouse group, the Western Australian Pulp and Paper Co. Pty Ltd and the Moora Pulp and Paper Co. Neither I, nor, to the best of my knowledge, any member of my family or any company that I or my family is involved in, is a shareholder in any one of those companies or otherwise has a financial interest in the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a grain grower, I have an interest in the activities and decisions of the Grains Council of Australia and the Australian Wheat Board. I am not, however, a member of the Grains Council or the Wheat Board and am not in a position to influence the decisions of either of those bodies. From time to time I have offered some public criticism of these bodies in relation to particular matters&mdash;whether it be this matter or any other matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not speak with the Australian Wheat Board about this project before decisions were made by the Australian Wheat Board to invest in the project. My office spoke briefly with a staff member of the AWB following receipt of the letter from the Printing and Kindred Industries Union. As a grain grower and as a person who wants to see Australia maximise its returns from its products, I have an interest in seeing the development of value added projects. I shall return to that point shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Senator Cook imputed to me a dishonourable motive simply because I asked a question. He did so without the slightest fact that could even suggest that there were grounds for the position he took. He made a serious accusation without foundation. It could be regarded as an attempt at intimidation to discourage honourable senators from asking legitimate questions. We have, unfortunately, come to expect that kind of snide behaviour from that gentleman sheltering behind the privilege of the Parliament. I ask that he apologise and withdraw his assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the statement that Senator Cook tabled on 14 November which purported to answer the question I had asked on 11 November in relation to the proposed Moora straw pulp and paper mill project in Western Australia. His statement completely ignored the context in which I asked the question. He is a person who at times twists his response. My question on 11 November was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer the Minister to the call by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, to increase value adding opportunities in Australia. In light of this call, I ask the Minister whether he is aware of the actions of the Western Australian branch of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union in trying to wreck the proposed straw pulp and paper mill at Moora in Western Australia before it gets off the ground?</PARA>
<PARA>My concern is that projects which add value to Australian produce be encouraged and given every opportunity to prove themselves. Senator Cook may remember that on 10 October the Senate, in its response to a motion moved by me, condemned the Government for its ineptitude in allowing many mining projects around Australia to be either totally stopped or delayed, and also condemned the Government for eight years of lost opportunity on these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook's tabled statement on 14 November in effect rubbished the initiative of trying to establish a viable pulp and paper project based on wheat straw as the basic raw material and, in addition, providing a further recycling opportunity for waste paper. He rubbished this attempt at testing another value added project; a project which, if viable, would add a further source of income to the rural sector, would increase job opportunities in rural Australia and would spread the range of raw material used for manufacturing packaging. It could, if successful, stimulate alternative processes and reduce or at least help contain the present reliance on woodchips&mdash;as well as be a way to dispose of straw, rather than burning it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the project will be economically feasible and worth proceeding with is for those involved as investors and risk takers to determine in the light of advice received and their best judgments based on the analysis of the facts. If those so involved want, in the meantime, to protect a future niche in an expanding market by competing against other companies currently manufacturing packaging material by importing cardboard container products then that is their affair. Once the Moora pulp mill comes on line there will be no need to import. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that about 100 tonnes of boxes are presently being imported each month; that is, 1,200 tonnes per year. This relatively small amount contrasts with the approximately 35,000 tonnes per year produced on the domestic WA market. There are, of course, measures that can be taken to stop the dumping of products if dumping can be proved by those who are alleging that this is occurring in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook's shock-horror about the importation of cardboard container products and his blind support of the union's opposition to that is somewhat misplaced. Indeed, I understand that one of the companies presently manufacturing cardboard container products in Western Australia is itself importing pulp from Indonesia. In fact, one firm alone imports seven times more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether Senator Cook has seen the notice printed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 30 October 1991 headed `A Message to the State Government from the employees of Visy Board, O'Connor, W.A.' that had at the bottom `Visy Board Western Australia', together with the logo of the company.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. That notice promotes the possibility of some collusion between that existing operating company and the Printing and Kindred Industries Union to attempt to wreck a potential competitor. That notice must also cast some doubts on the claims that the proposed Moora pulp mill is not as viable as the unions and others are claiming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Visy Board believes the project is not viable, one would think that it would sit back and laugh, wait for the collapse and then pick up a cheap outfit. It could be that there is an intentional disinformation campaign to hinder the Moora project and make it impossible, or at least very difficult, for the Moora organisation to attract finance and get started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook's response to my question ignored the broader prospect of Australia adding value to its primary products; ignored the possibility of encouraging alternative material for the production of cardboard packaging; ignored the possibility of the longer term development of further employment opportunities; and ignored the possibility of providing employment in and helping stabilise rural communities. He simply rushed in to support a union body without any balancing considerations. It is yet another example of the one-eyed approach he brings to his portfolio to which this Senate has unfortunately become accustomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to Senator Cook coming into this place and withdrawing the accusation that I spoke on this matter because of some shareholding that he thought that I or my family might have had in that project.

When challenged by my colleagues on this side of the chamber, he walked out of the Senate like a coward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to respond to the attack from Senator Sherry. At the outset, I thank Senator Sherry for the courtesy he extended to me by advising me that he was going to respond to some statements I had made in the past. If an honourable senator is going to make an attack against someone, it conforms with the established traditions of the Senate to advise that person. I must say that I learned of Senator Sherry's speech in Senator Durack's office when one of his staff advised me that Senator Sherry was running off at the mouth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not hear all of Senator Sherry's speech and I will probably have to come back tomorrow night to address the parts of the speech that I did not hear. When I came in here, I heard Senator Sherry saying that anyone who did not understand the Cooke report was either a liar or someone who could not read a report. Having been here for nearly 14 years, I think I have established my reputation, and there would not be anyone in the chamber who would accuse me of not being truthful. All I will say is this: I am not a recycled pommy shop steward. I can read reports and, more than that, I can write them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charge I laid against Senator Sherry had nothing to do with Senator Sherry personally. All I was drawing attention to was the fact that a notation was made in the Cooke report that the laws of Queensland had been broken at the time, and that is a matter of fact. I also said it was a matter of fact that the socialist Goss Government changed those laws subsequently so that if the same action was taken today it would not be an offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues tell me that Senator Sherry said that I accused the AWU of making the donation to his campaign funds, and that really it was done by the Liquor Trades Union. If I did make that claim, I am quite happy to retract it and say that the Liquor Trades Union did it. However, the burden of my complaint was the way the Labor Party raised funds by standover tactics through the union movement and used it to get candidates elected. It was a technique which is not available to the democratic parties of Australia. On that point, I rest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hone report did not assess the risk of transmissible gastroenteritis entering Australian pig herds. The BRR study by Dr Jim Hone used a mathematical model to evaluate some of the biological and production consequences if transmissible gastroenteritis were to enter and establish in Australia.The report concluded that control or eradication of transmissible gastroenteritis, should it enter Australian piggeries, will require accurate early identification, adequate surveillance of high risk piggeries and proper management of the disease within piggeries, including the control of movement of pigs between piggeries. Research is advocated on likely rates of disease spread between piggeries and the duration of immunity of pigs that have recovered from transmissible gastroenteritis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Minister is fully satisfied that the 22 documents do not contain relevant information to Australian pig producers. The decision to import pigmeat from Canada followed intensive discussions between AQIS officers, producers and experts in the areas of pig husbandry and health over a period of more than 7 years. The study of Dr Hone did not provide any information that would cause the government to reverse its decision. I am therefore satisfied that the decision-making process of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is open to a proper degree of public scrutiny.</PARA>
