<TITLE>Tobacco Advertising</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned call for urgent action by our Federal Parliament and all government agencies concerned with Health and Sport to impose an immediate ban on the incidental advertising of tobacco products on television and provide for alternative funding to replace tobacco sponsorship. That tobacco sponsorship of sporting events and participants openly flouts the 1976 Federal law prohibiting tobacco advertising on TV and radio. That our Parliament immediately end this association between healthy sports and the deaths of 18,300 people in Australia each year from tobacco-related diseases.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to a motion to require the tabling of the departmental report on the evaluation of tenders for the supply of computer consumables referred to during Question Time on 7 May 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The urgency of this matter should be apparent. There could be few more serious charges concerning a Minister for Administrative Services than the suggestion of some improper involvement in a tendering process. In this instance, that is the apparent circumstance from reports in the press of an exchange of correspondence between Senator Bolkus and his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an allegation that gives rise to immediate concern among all Australians and, in particular, requires action by this Parliament to determine whether that allegation, as apparent from the press reports, can be substantiated. The Minister, in turn, answers this charge by going on the television program, the 7.30 Report, and saying that his position has been vindicated by an apparent inquiry which questions the tendering process-something that does not seem to relate at all to the exchange of letters that occurred, which was really a requirement by the Minister that an unsuccessful tenderer be included in the list of successful tenderers. </PARA>
<PARA> The 7.30 Report, apparently having had this internal investigation leaked to it by the Minister, says that the Minister has provided an adequate answer to the charge, and other press reports include that as well. Not surprisingly, in Question Time yesterday Senator Parer asked the Minister to produce the document which is the basis of his answer to the allegations against him, and, to our amazement, he refused to do so. Therefore, we have a circumstance in which the Minister says that an internal investigation has found that his action was reasonable, that that internal investigation is made available to certain elements within the press, but it is not provided to the Parliament for assessment. That is an unsatisfactory situation, to say the very least. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister cannot justify his actions by secret internal reports. If he says that he has an answer, he should be prepared to put the whole of that answer before the Parliament so that a proper and reason- able assessment can be made. In those circumstances of urgency, I seek the suspension of Standing Orders this morning in order that I can move the motion that that internal report be put before the Parliament, in turn, in order that a proper judgment can be made of its contents. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Manager of Government Business in the Senate)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(10.12 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was first informed about this at about 10.02 a.m., and I have not had a chance to confer with Senator Bolkus. The suspension of Standing Orders has been moved many times in this place, and on many occasions I have argued that the matter is not timely and urgent. I cannot in this case because the matter was raised yesterday in Question Time. Therefore, I would not oppose the suspension of Standing Orders on this ground. The more substantive issues can be debated when Senator Hill moves his motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, whilst Senator Bolkus will probably be in a position to put his point of view, some of the rest of us have not had a chance to study the matter and we will be somewhat disadvantaged by that ambush in debate. I do not say that there is anything malevolent in that ambush because this is really the first available opportunity for these matters to be discussed in the chamber, but I point out that every time we put down a ministerial statement we are criticised for the two-hour ruling; we give only two hours notice. In this case, we have two minutes notice. From now on, every time I am prevailed upon to provide documents more than two hours before, I will remember this particular occasion-not with any aggressive intent, I might add. It is just that the rest of us will not be given a chance even to read the document to see whether other factors are involved as to why it should be disclosed or otherwise. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that the 7.30 Report had the document. I watched the program, and I did not get that impression. We have a different impression of that. But I will not go into the substance of debate during the discussion on the suspension of the Standing Orders. I put this suggestion to Senator Hill: I think we should proceed with the rest of the business of the Senate until about 11 o'clock and then take the matter up so that a couple of us can look at the documents and discuss them with Senator Bolkus. I do not know what the result of those discussions will be, but that will give us a chance to look at some of the factors involved. At this stage, I indicate that 11 o'clock would be a good starting point for the debate. That is the only suggestion I make. The Government will not oppose, now or then, the suspension of Standing Orders to discuss the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point that was just made by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray), I certainly would be happy to entertain an amendment to the motion that Senator Hill proposes to move. I am surprised to hear that the Opposition had not approached the Government earlier on this matter. I would have thought it would have done so, if not as a matter of courtesy, certainly as a means of making sure that there is some positive outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are prepared to support the suspension of Standing Orders to enable a motion to be moved asking Senator Bolkus to table certain documents. We are happy to support the suspension because we believe that any honourable senator in this place, in these circumstances, has a right to ask a Minister to table documents and, if the Minister is not prepared to do so, to ask why not. For that reason, we believe that the suspension should be supported and we are prepared to support such a motion. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the substance of the issue, I would have to say that what takes place in the subsequent debate will determine the view of the Democrats in respect of the substantive motion. That has been our view ever since we were approached by the Opposition. I am therefore surprised, as I say, that the Government has not been given notice on the same basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the fact that our support for this suspension motion does not necessarily indicate support or lack of support for the substantive motion. We will intently listen to the debate. This will be a very good example of the way the Senate should work-that decisions should not be made before debate has taken place. In this case, the decision will be made during the debate. Senator Hill has been requested by the Minister to amend his motion to enable debate to take place a little later this morning. As I say, I will support such an amended motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two more motions to be dealt with. The first is a formal motion. As Standing Orders have been suspended, I think it might be in the best interests of the Senate if that motion were moved and hopefully carried. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That a motion to require the tabling of the departmental report on the evaluation of tenders for the supply of computer consumables may be moved forthwith and have precedence over all other business till determined. </PARA>
<PARA>If that motion is carried, I would be happy to entertain an amendment that further debate be adjourned until 11 a.m. today. I accept the request of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) which was made in an atmosphere of good will. But I should say that I think it is a very long bow to draw to try to make a comparison between ministerial statements and providing adequate time for them to be considered and debated when it is the Minister's defence, which he has put up out of the chamber and which is clearly before him, which is in question in this instance. It is an entirely different set of circumstances. Nevertheless, we will meet the request that the debate be adjourned for a short period of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when this debate was interrupted I was making the point that allowing these amendments to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which alters the Industrial Relations Commission, is, to use the good old comment, like playing with the deck chairs on the Titanic, because this set of amendments does not deal with the basic problems of industrial relations in Australia. No matter how much the Government fiddles at the sides with the arrangements of the Industrial Relations Commission, the fact is that the Commission structure, the whole approach that this Government adopts to industrial relations, is, in fact, causing job losses and holding back Australia's economic recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night I was arguing that the extent to which it has had a direct impact on job losses can clearly be seen by looking at the statistics for one section of the community which does not have the opportunity to argue in front of the Industrial Relations Commission, that is, the young people of Australia. Last night I was making the point that job losses over the last 12 months have been concentrated on the under-20s, the young people of Australia. Even though they make up only about 5 per cent of the Australian work force, they have suffered almost 60 per cent of the job losses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of jobs lost in Australia over the last 12 months-jobs wiped out in this recession that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said we had to have-has been concentrated in the under-20s. This clearly indicates that the methods adopted by the industrial relations club-the big union, big business, big government operation which is perpetuated in these amendments-work to the clear disadvantage of individual groups such as the under-20s. There is nothing in the industrial relations law that does anything to help. On the contrary, it massively hinders the young people coming into the work force searching for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the disasters we face is that when there is an economic downturn-a recession like the one Mr Keating says we had to have-the people in the firing line of that recession are the under-20s, as the statistics I have just outlined clearly slow. When something like 25.7 per cent of all jobs for the under-20s is being wiped out in one year throughout Australia, there is a real crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of wiping out those jobs has not been effectively reflected in the unemployment statistics because, as I have noted in the past, there have been some governmental gimmicks to hide the true level of unemployment. One could describe these gimmicks as doctoring of the unemployment figures for the under-20s. Certainly, the recent unpublished official regional labour force statistics for March 1991 show that over the last 12 months 110,700 full time teenage jobs were lost in Australia. That compares with something like 82,500 adult jobs lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though 110,700 full time teenage jobs have been lost in Australia, total teenage employment has gone up by only 41,000. This leaves something like 70,000 young people disappearing from the unemployment statistics. When we add these disappearing people back into the figures, we see that the real unemployment rate among the under-20s looking for full time work in Australia is probably 36 per cent rather than the 25 per cent or one in four young people out of a job in the official figures. That is the worst ever recorded. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of jobs being wiped out is a far more accurate indicator of how the recession is hitting young Australians than the official unemployment statistics, which, while horrific, nonetheless, as I have demonstrated, massively understate the problem. This has emerged through a combination of the Government's $300m a year extension of Austudy to secondary school students to get them out of dole queues and back into school and a statistical gimmick which now excludes from the definition of `unemployed' anyone who works more than one hour a week for no pay-for example, on a family farm or doing job experience. This means that there is a huge level of hidden unemployment, the size of which is indicated by the massive job loss statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems clear that the present system-which is tinkered with in these amendments-does nothing to give a fair go to young employees. Clearly, they are losing their jobs, are not being employed, and are bearing the brunt of the recession. It is not economic for employers in difficult economic situations to provide jobs to young people, particularly when the differential between young wages and adult wages-in other words, between relatively inexperienced people's wages and experienced people's wages-has been reduced as a result of continual decisions by the Industrial Relations Commission and deals struck between big government, big unions and big business, rubber-stamped in many instances in the past by the Commission. When the Industrial Relations Commission refuses to rubber-stamp what the Government wants and determines, it is subject to pretty violent public attack by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Ministers of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the impact of State governments on the economies of the various States has a clear impact on the level of youth unemployment and the extent to which young people are being priced out of jobs in the various States. Clearly, the best way to resolve this would be to enable people to come to employment agreements which hopefully would bear a greater relationship to productivity than to formal things such as across the board pay rises irrespective of whether an industry or business can afford it.</PARA>
<PARA> If we had pay rates by productivity, people who are relatively inexperienced, relatively untrained, and whose productivity was clearly lower than more experienced people-in other words, young people of Australia-would probably claim lower pay rates but many more of them would be in jobs. In the rigid structure of the Industrial Relations Commission and the Government's approach to industrial relations generally, there is no capacity for young people to have lower productivity-I am not criticising lower productivity; it is a function of experience-reflected in lower relative wages. If we had the choice of either employing many more young people or having the present wage structure, surely all Australians would prefer to see a change in the wage structure. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become intolerable in places such as Melbourne where the official figures show that there has been a 35 per cent job loss for people under 20 years of age. That has led to an official unemployment rate of about 27.1 per cent. Worse than one in four Melbourne people are out of work, according to official statistics. When we look at the number of jobs that have been wiped out and the enormous gap between the number of jobs wiped out and the increase in unemployment, we find that the real unemployment rate of young people in Melbourne is about 45 per cent. This 35 per cent job loss for the under-20s in Melbourne has chopped the number of teenagers in full time work from 70,600 to only 45,800. That is a loss of 24,800 jobs. Melbourne is the capital city in Australia with the highest youth unemployment, with 33,100 young Melburnians still looking for full time or part time work. </PARA>
<PARA> The collapse of the Melbourne job market means that more than half of the 96,400 people in Melbourne aged between 15 years and 19 years with jobs have been able to get only part time work. Even that is getting harder to find as 6,700 part time jobs have also disappeared over the past year-lifting the total job losses in Melbourne in the last 12 months to 31,400. It is extraordinary that this loss of 24,800 full time jobs has resulted in only a 5,800 job rise in the official under-20s unemployment figure for Melbourne, causing 19,000 jobs for young people to disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> As we did with the Australian figures, when we add back these disappearers into the figures, the real full time unemployment rate in Melbourne for 15- to 19-year-olds is about 45 per cent-a record. If we compare that with the Sydney situation-I mention in passing that Sydney is in the only State with a Liberal Government-the official unemployment rate for young people is 18.1 per cent as against 21.7 per cent in Melbourne. When we add back the relatively few jobs which disappear from the statistics in Sydney, there is a real unemployment rate for the under-20s in Sydney of about 29 per cent, which is still horrific, compared with Melbourne's 45 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table shows that other States also have an horrific real unemployment rate for young people. In Melbourne, the rate is 45 per cent; in Hobart, 42 per cent; in Perth, 40 per cent; in Adelaide, 35 per cent; and in Brisbane, 33 per cent. Brisbane has been assisted by the development, the growth, of quite a few part time jobs. Sydney has the best rate of 29 per cent. Maybe that says something about the economic policies of the States involved. The key issue is that the present amendments to this legislation do nothing to correct the fundamental disasters for youth unemployment that are emerging as a result of this Government's policies and the rigid industrial relations structure under this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I have been caught a bit short. Senator Baume was rising to make his final point and I was listening to the tone of his voice as well as the content of his contribution. We have before us this morning the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, and that rather arcane description of the Bill hides the fact that this is not a Bill which deals in a full-blooded, wholehearted way with major industrial relations amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill serves to improve important functions in industrial relations in Australia. While I would shrink from saying that this is a tinkering piece of legislation-it is not; it is much more than that-it is, as I have said, not a substantial recasting of any of the industrial relations institutions or a substantial review of the operation of industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four elements embraced by this Bill, known in parliamentary parlance as an omnibus Bill. These are to enact the recommendations of the Gleeson inquiry into the operation and functioning of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; to deal with modifications to section 202 of the Industrial Relations Act-that section dealing with registration of unions and in this case, where unions are of a federal registration, dealing with amalgamations or sorting out affairs with unions of a State registration-to deal with amendments to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal; and, importantly, to deal with changes to the Trade Union Training Authority Act-changes which reflect an element of restructuring in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. I certainly wish to identify more with the contribution made by Senator Paul McLean, the industrial relations spokesperson for the Australian Democrats. While it is true that he certainly did not endorse the Government's position fully-and as foreshadowed, I understand it is his intention to move amendments in the committee stage-he nonetheless generally, on behalf of his Party, has indicated that the core direction of these amendments is acceptable and that they will not be opposed outright as the Opposition has indicated it will oppose them in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the comments by the Opposition. Firstly, much of what has been said in this debate has not been about the specific amendments proposed. As is not unusual in matters of industrial relations, this Bill has provided an opportunity for honourable senators to make remarks that range wide from the actual proposed amendments and go to the broad subject of the industrial relations debate in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that that has gone on, many of the speeches have not been specifically relevant to the issues under consideration by the Senate, but that is not an uncommon feature of second reading debates. However, some of the comments on the generality of things cannot pass unanswered by the Government, lest it be assumed by anyone that lack of a comment in reply is taken as any form of acceptance of what has been said. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard a speech from Senator Baume dealing, in essence, with youth unemployment. The invitation, explicit at various points in that speech, is that we are meant to assume that youth unemployment in this country is high because of the nature of industrial relations regulation. That is an extraordinary premise. It is not a premise widely supported outside the conservative parties in this country and it is not a premise supported by major employer institutions-to name one group-unions and indeed this Government, which have a close working knowledge of what in fact are the provisions of the Act and the flexibilities provided in the Act and which, by a decision of the Commission, set a precedent to deal with issues of hardship in industry, if those conditions are genuine and if there is a real need to review minimum standards because of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The most celebrated example of what I refer to, in recent memory, concerns SPC Ltd. This company had suffered considerable losses because, as the shareholders of that company recognised, its previous management had engaged in all the speculative whimsy of the stock market in the period leading up to the crash in 1987 and had seen this small regional canning company as some sort of incarnation of the Alan Bond or Robert Holmes a Court type of concept of industrial takeover and share trading, and had embarked ambitiously on that course of action for itself, and had run the company into debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The shareholders cast out that management and appointed a new management. That new management coming in faced a very difficult balance sheet. It had discussions with the employees about a rescue package and took that rescue package to the Industrial Relations Commission and, with the assistance of the Commission, finally came to a conclusion to which the unions, the workers and the management all happily agreed. That did not, as the Opposition or indeed as some pundits and writers in the press would have it, and as may unfortunately be the popular legend at the moment, result in any significant change to the award structure at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The only condition in the award that was forgone was that, instead of paying wages weekly in a wage packet handed to workers, wages would be paid by electronic funds transfer into the bank accounts of workers. That was the only award change that was made. However, significant savings were made because over-award payments were forgone, put back and rearranged and, without the awards being varied, with the assistance of the Commission that company is now fighting its way back into the black out of a very doubtful balance sheet brought on by the previous management of the company, not by the workers or their capacity to produce product out of that company. I appreciate that that may not, in all of the debate that has been generated, be well understood as a true statement. However, whether it is well understood or not, it is my obligation to tell the truth and that is the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> The popular fiction may be, as Senator Baume would have it, that because there are not sufficient flexibilities in the system, all of these troubles flow. The truth is that there are sufficient flexibilities. I have given an example of a celebrated one, and it is an example of how changes can be related to the specific circumstances of a company. </PARA>
<PARA> The important element that this Government identifies is that there must be an authority which says, `These outcomes are fair' so that the rule of the jungle does not apply-that when there is unemployment, employers can threaten workers with dismissal if they do not agree to the conditions of employment or the remuneration for work imposed by the employers and say, `If you do not like it, get out. You will take what we can give you, and it will not be a living wage. That is your problem, not ours'. </PARA>
<PARA> That type of system, which applied last century, would have applied this century had there not been an umpire to say what is fair. The refereeing of those outcomes is important. So what Senator Baume is talking about is a return to the removal of that type of check and balance and allowing the market to determine wages without reference to fairness, and that means that the bargaining power of the parties becomes the central determinant. </PARA>
<PARA> With high unemployment, the bargaining power of employers to force down wages is strong. With the recovery of the Australian economy in prospect for the second half of this year and employment picking up further because of that, bargaining power will shift from where it is now, with employers, to unions. If the law of the jungle is applied now, and employers wish to maximise their bargaining power and exploit the market, they can expect that when the recovery comes along unions, in recognition of what employers have done, will emulate them, exploit the market and push up wages accordingly. That is the law of the jungle: if one has a market position, one exploits it to one's own advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Commission, underpinned by the accord in our period of government, is to provide some sanity to that situation, to provide respect and dignity for workers and to provide an opportunity for wages to be determined against some rational criteria. As I say, the flexibilities are there where there are specific hardship cases and so on. In summary on this point, I do not accept the allegation that the industrial relations institutions of this country, and the way in which they operate, are directly responsible in any way for the level of unemployment, or youth unemployment, as the Opposition has been propounding. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go on and answer a couple of questions that were raised in the debate. It seems to me that no substantial debate was entered into on the changes to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. Therefore, there is nothing for me to say on that. No real debate was entered into on the changes to section 202 of the Act although, in terms of industrial relations law, it is a quite important amendment. It will have the effect of rationalising the union structure in this country, given the differences between Federal and State jurisdictions, quite importantly. By doing that, it will minimise the potential for demarcation disputes, which is something that all of us lament the incidence of and wish to see diminished. I must say that the incidence of demarcation disputes has fallen markedly in recent years. The amendments to section 202 will be quite important and significant in the industrial relations landscape. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Trade Union Training Authority Act, as I have said, restructure the Authority to guarantee that it performs its tasks with greater efficiency. It also guarantees that the investment that there is in trade union training to provide minimum skills at negotiation and representation for workers in the workplace who do not have access to management training schemes is discharged properly. I think these are commendable amendments and I have commended them to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the debate was about the Gleeson report. The debate, if I might characterise it, fell into two categories. The first was that the legislation arose at the behest of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and that the Government is nothing more than-if I might characterise it in the terms that the Opposition would use, not us-the ACTU's poodle, doing its bidding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have. I thank the honourable senator. I want to demolish it and I am glad that Senator Chapman has reaffirmed it. That is the concept and I will deal with its demolition in a second. The second element of the Opposition's contribution was that somehow or other these amendments are a stalking-horse for the Government's evil intent to introduce a labour court into this country, which is not something that the community wants. Those are the two issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the first issue, the Gleeson inquiry was conducted by three people, the first being the person after whom the inquiry was named, the chairman of the group, Mr Gerry Gleeson, a former head of the Premier's Department in New South Wales and a distinguished public servant in this country, honoured by an Order of Australia. No-one has criticised Mr Gleeson in terms of his public standing and his competence for this position. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other members of the inquiry was His Honour Mr Justice Olsson, a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia and a former President-appointed, as I recall, by a Liberal government-of the South Australian Industrial Relations Commission, as it now is. He is a distinguished industrial relations authority as well as a judge of significant standing in the South Australian court. No-one has criticised Mr Justice Olsson as being an unfit person to make the judgments that have been delivered in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The third member of the inquiry team was Professor Alan Fels, the Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority and a professor of economics at Monash University in Victoria. No-one criticises his economic expertise or his knowledge of these institutions. It is from these three people, after investigation involving submissions from the Government, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the ACTU and the Commission itself, that this report emanates and it is in recognition of their findings that the Government now moves to legislate. The characterisation of that process as a process in which a government is answering the bidding of the ACTU is within the capacity only of someone who wishes to besmirch or besmear the process and to try to achieve a political point rather than recognise in fact what has been the process. </PARA>
<PARA> The findings of this inquiry recommend that the Commission be restructured to recognise that this Government has taken a critical and vital initiative in industrial relations. We have succeeded now in doing something that has defied Commonwealth governments since Federation. We at last have an agreement between the Commonwealth and the six States of Australia, all of which maintain their own separate and distinct industrial jurisdictions. So there are in this country seven arbitration tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> We have achieved an agreement between them to cross-appoint the members of their tribunals to our tribunals and, if you like, blend the six State tribunals with a Commonwealth tribunal in a network which makes some national sense of the industrial relations structure and enables matters coming up in one jurisdiction to be heard by the same person crossing into the next jurisdiction and back. It simply streamlines the process. It is not the ideal outcome but it is certainly a very innovative and intelligent application of what is possible in a country which is made up of a federation of States with an essentially weak national government but with a Constitution that provides that government with the power to make laws on industrial relations for disputes going beyond one State. </PARA>
<PARA> The restructuring of the Commission arises in part because we have appointed the heads of State tribunals to our Federal bench. The recommendation to create the position of a senior deputy president is partly in recognition of that and partly in recognition that some members of the Federal bench hold the honorific of judges, are legally qualified people who specialise in industrial law and, it might be considered, ought to be of the character and standing for appointment to a court dealing with industrial matters, in whatever form. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a stalking-horse for a labour court, but it may turn out that a labour court is agreed to. Let me make the distinction that this is an amendment that ought to be made because of the changes we are bringing about in rationalising industrial jurisdiction in this country. But it may turn out to be convenient if there is agreement between the industrial relations partners-employers, unions and the Government-about a labour court. We have not sought to impose a labour court on people or to have a perfect view of the ideal structure of such a court, if there were to be one. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what we have done. We started notifying all the parties in April of last year that we were reviewing the Act. In January of last year we sat down with the ACTU and the Confederation of Australian Industry and, in view of what the parties to the Act had said, started a process of discussion. We published discussion papers looking at various options. We are now in the midst of canvassing those options and considering what the outcome should be. We are seeking a consensus of parties who are normally divided over industrial relations matters as to what the right structure of the law is, so that when the law is enacted there is a commitment to it and a preparedness to work through it. That is the process we are engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not Viner legislation from the Fraser years in which a government sitting in the perfect isolation of Canberra imposes on the industrial relations parties its view of what it wants. This is a government working with the major parties to bring about a central commitment, cooperation and a structure of law that reflects their interests. It is interesting, if not indeed passing strange, to see that earlier this year-a month or six weeks ago-when the shadow spokesperson for industrial relations, the former Treasurer in the Fraser government, Mr Howard, attacked us over the prospect of a labour court, the Confederation of Australian Industry, a group from which the Opposition would expect to gain succour in industrial matters, said that it supported the prospect and disagreed with Mr Howard. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get this matter into context. If there is a labour court-a matter yet to be decided because we are still insisting on rational discussion and the discovery of a consensus-then it will be there because the parties seek it and not because of preconceived views of the Opposition about what it might be. On the public record there is now a clear disagreement between the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Opposition. This raises the question, if the Opposition is not speaking for employers in this country, not speaking for the unions and not speaking for governments, of who the hell it is speaking for other than its own warped version of ideology. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the interjections, let me just go one step further because this is an interesting question in the industrial relations debate. We had Bills before the New South Wales Parliament that arose from an inquiry into industrial relations in New South Wales by Professor John Niland. While it is true that the Greiner Government did not pick up all of the Niland recommendations-it modified those recommendations-nonetheless, the core of the Niland recommendations is to move the Australian industrial relations system into a collective bargaining structure rather than an arbitration structure, along the lines that apply in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That system involves a recognition that unions and employers negotiate at company level. It also involves a recognition of a right for employers to lock out workers in those negotiations and a right of unions to go on strike in those negotiations-a right on both sides. That is based on the American system. I think it is wrong in terms of its application to Australia because it is alien to our custom and practice in this country. But those, in essence, were the Niland findings: a right to strike and a right to lock out. </PARA>
<PARA> When the subject of a right to strike was being canvassed publicly some months ago, the spokesperson for the Opposition, Mr Howard, condemned it. Therefore, he is further to the right of the New South Wales Government than the Niland recommendations suggest, which I think, by the way, is unacceptable in industrial conduct in Australia and ought not be enacted here. I make the point that the Opposition is to the right of even the Greiner Government in this debate and seemingly wishes to go down the road of the New Zealand National Party Government. I conclude my remarks and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That there be laid on the table of the Senate, at or before 12.45 p.m. today, a copy of the departmental report on the evaluation of tenders for the supply of computer consumables referred to at Question Time on 7 May 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I outlined this morning in the debate on the suspension of the Standing Orders the basis of the requirement of the Opposition that this document be tabled in the Senate. Let me put the matter in more explicit terms by specifically referring to what seems to be an exchange of correspondence between the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, and his Department as referred to in some detail in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 19 April. It is really this correspondence that raises the very major concerns that I mentioned this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter relates to a tender for computer consumables which had been let by the Department of Administrative Services. It seems that the process of tendering had been concluded; one of the unsuccessful tenderers apparently made representations to the Minister; and the Minister then took action, demanding that this unsuccessful party be included in the list of successful tenderers, although the process had closed. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, I refer to an apparent letter from Senator Bolkus. When I say `apparent', I mean apparent to the extent that I have seen press reports. The contents of this exchange have not been refuted by the Minister in Estimates Committee D or in debate in this chamber since. In that letter of 4 March, Senator Bolkus wrote to his Department:</PARA>
<PARA>Following representations from Nashua and the offer of new . . . price list, it would seem that Nashua have unfortunately hurt their own case by not submitting their best price at the time of the tender. </PARA>
<PARA>That is astonishing in itself because it seems that Nashua acknowledged that the process had closed, but-as we heard yesterday-had gone through an intermediary to the Minister and indicated that it could have submitted a lower price and would now like the opportunity to do so. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a point that is subsequently raised by the Department in response to that. If we are going to reopen the tenders to benefit one, what about others? What is the point of the first tender process if we are not going to make decisions on the basis of it? Continuing with Senator Bolkus's letter, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It concerns me that an established and satisfactory supplier to the Government can be put off the contract without the department wanting to satisfy itself that it has not unfairly treated the company. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed we should be making every effort to satisfy ourselves that Australian suppliers have put forward their best offer. My view is that we should be actively seeking out competitive Australian suppliers to put on the common use contracts and elsewhere, in line with the Purchase Australia Campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>Here comes the incredible statement from Senator Bolkus to his Department after tenders have closed; the tender has been let:</PARA>
<PARA> I direct that you reconsider Nashua's bid with a view to putting Nashua on the contract, subject to their new prices meeting the criteria used in the initial assessment of the bids. Please advise Nashua immediately of the decision in writing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Tenders have closed; the tender has been let; but one of the unsuccessful tenderers says to the Minister, `We want a second go, offering lower prices.' The Minister then writes to his Department saying that Nashua apparently did not put forward its lowest price and, therefore, it has unfortunately harmed itself in the tender process. He then directs that the Department now reconsider Nashua's bid with a view to putting it on the contract and, further more, that it write to Nashua immediately, advising it of this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of that, that is a blatant interference by the Minister for Administrative Services with the tendering process and the basis of very serious allegations. It is those allegations that require an answer. What was the response of the Department to that letter from the Minister, directing it to take this course of action? We understand that Mr S. J. Palywoda wrote back to the Minister in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the requirements of the Finance Regulations and Directions were complied with, as were the Commonwealth's Procurement Guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have reconsidered Nashua's bid but believe it cannot be accepted as to do so would totally compromise the tender process and place Nashua at an unfair advantage . . . we do not consider that cancelling the contract and calling new tenders is appropriate because there is no evidence to suggest that the tender or the evaluation was in any way flawed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department has said that there was no flaw in the process. There was therefore no reason to cancel the tenders. Nashua is a very experienced tenderer. I think the Minister mentioned yesterday that it has been successful on previous occasions. It understands the tender documents and understands the basis on which it needs to put forward its best price in the first instance. It did not do so. It therefore was unsuccessful, and the Department could see no basis on which it could properly reopen the tender. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of Australian suppliers, which is a point that Senator Bolkus has tried to raise, the Department advised the Minister that, of the two Australian bidders, one had been successful. Quite correctly, it said that the policy did not extend to discriminating against foreign suppliers. In effect, what the Department said was that it properly took into account the guidelines, including those which related to Australian suppliers, but it could not give benefit to Australian suppliers over a foreign bidder if the price did not warrant that. As the Department officer said, giving preference to Australian suppliers did not extend to `discriminating against foreign suppliers'. On the face of the documents that we have before us, the Department has refuted the Minister's claim and has rejected his requirement that Nashua's bid be given the benefit of hindsight and that Nashua be able to revise its prices accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the Minister's answer to this very serious allegation? Regrettably, to find his answer to this charge we have to turn to the television program, the 7.30 Report, or to an article that appeared in the Canberra Times on 7 May, written by Tony Wright. It seems that the Minister's answer to the charge of improper interference was that the tender process was flawed, that subsequent to his intervention-which, on the face of it, was improper intervention-there was a review of the tender process and that it was found that that process could be done better. I presume that Paul Lyneham of the 7.30 Report had this internal inquiry report before him. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why not just listen? I presume that he had that internal inquiry report before him because I do not believe that he would make conclusions on the basis of the Minister's simply saying that there was an undisclosed internal report that vindicated his position. My conclusion is supported by the fact that the article by Tony Wright in the Canberra Times quoted part of the internal report, and I cannot see that it would be leaked to the Canberra Times and not to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which principally had to run the story that the Minister had been vindicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is an argument as to whether this question of revisiting and improving the tender process is in fact an answer to the charge in any event. I have no doubt that all tender processes can be improved. If we look to the Minister's letter to the Department, we find that he said nothing about a need to improve the tender process. I have quoted what he said. He said nothing at all about that. On the face of it, that was an afterthought to try to justify an improper intervention by the Minister at the time. But that is a debate that we will have another day. </PARA>
<PARA> All we are seeking in this debate is for the Minister not to be permitted to justify his position on the basis of some secret internal document. If that is to be his defence, he should put down his defence in the chamber, and not do as he did yesterday when he answered Senator Parer by saying, `I have been vindicated by an internal report; I am not going to put it before the Senate because it is commercial-in-confidence; but I will quote selective parts from it which prove my defence'. That is an improper way of attempting to defend the charge that is brought before him by anyone who looks at his original letter to the Department, which, as I said, on the face of it is blatant interference in a tender process after the tender has been let. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have brought this matter before the Senate this morning to seek of the Senate a resolution that it require the Minister to table that internal document. I would not have been surprised if, in answer to the question yesterday, Senator Bolkus had said that there are aspects in this internal document that may be commercial-in-confidence or may cause some embarrassment to a party. I wonder about it, because what we are talking about is a process. Apparently the Department revisited the tender process, not this particular tender or the application of the tender. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, if the Minister had come back and said, `The Department has put the names of some unsuccessful parties in it' or `There is some reason why, in the interests of third parties, I would feel uncomfortable about putting it before the Senate and I wish to speak to Senator Parer and to Senator Powell, as the Leader of the Australian Democrats, to see whether it can be agreed that the names be excised from that document before I table it', we would have understood that. But he did not do that. What he did yesterday was come into this place and say, `I will not let you have it but I will quote from it those parts which I say benefit my case'. </PARA>
<PARA> After the debate started this morning and during the intervention of other business, I understand that the Minister was out in the corridor, not wanting to come in to answer the case in the first instance-he was skulking in the corridor, not prepared to come in and answer. In the meantime, he has had the benefit of Senator Ray and his advisers and he is now in the chamber. He has also had the benefit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who has now written to the Opposition and said that he, the Prime Minister, is prepared to intervene and, as I interpret this letter, require Senator Bolkus to make available the letter to Dr Hewson and the appropriate shadow Minister-I am sorry to say to Senator Powell that there is no mention of the Australian Democrats- understanding that they would respect commercial-in-confidence; that a departmental officer could explain to them what the document would be; and so the matter would end. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard that as an unsatisfactory response, firstly because although we have an interest in this matter, so do other parties in the Parliament and so does the public. It is not simply for the Minister to say, `This is commercial-in-confidence and therefore I am not going to table it'. What happens if we accept this invitation, look at the document and are of the opinion that nothing is commercial-in-confidence in the document? In those circumstances, we do not see that it is an adequate response to our demand that this document be tabled before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister stands up today and says, as he should have said yesterday, `There is some aspect that causes embarrassment to third parties that we would like to talk to you about', obviously, as sensible people and not wanting to harm third parties, we would speak to the Minister about that. But he has not ever said that. </PARA>
<PARA> So on that basis, we put the case today that the Parliament is entitled to have this document before it in order to judge properly the defence that Senator Bolkus has sought through the media to raise in defence of his clearly, on the face of it, improper intervention in this tender process. Do not tell me that the Prime Minister has not given him a copy of the letter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say first off that the remark of Senator Hill that I found most offensive was his claim that Senator Bolkus was skulking out in the corridor, not wanting to come in and debate this matter. This comes from an individual who entered the Senate on the same day as I did and who has never taken on a tough debate in the 10 years that I have seen him here. He always comes in on the soft issues and never the tough ones. Go back through the records of the matters of public importance over the last 10 years and show me when he has ever entered a tough debate. So to say that a Minister of this Government is not willing to come into this chamber for a debate is a despicable accusation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill, of course, has left out certain aspects of the sequence of events in the last couple of days, especially when he talks about the Lyneham interview. This issue, in terms of press publicity and other things, was kicked along by a press release on Sunday from the Leader of the Opposition in which accusations were made against Senator Bolkus. That was followed up by Paul Lyneham on radio on Monday morning. I would strongly contend, those accusations having been made, that Senator Bolkus was entitled to defend himself as soon and as appropriately as possible. And he did so. </PARA>
<PARA> But the one thing that I am assured of-and this is the reason I appreciated having some time to look at the issue when it was first raised this morning-is that the documents referred to have not been given or shown to the press. They simply have not. Therefore, the argument, `Well, the press has seen them, therefore the Senate is entitled to' falls flat on its face. </PARA>

There is nothing inconsistent in the position that Ministers do not table those sorts of documents here.

<PARA> Senator Hill has cynically referred to correspondence between the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Prime Minister saying that he wanted the documents tabled. The counter offer was made that Dr Hewson and his spokesman, presumably Senator Parer, could look at those documents and that we would have no objection if the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Powell) also looked at them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to assure the Senate that the Government is not relying on the principle of commercial-in-confidence to try to protect any other aspect of what is in those reports and documents. In my view, we simply are not. But we cannot, just because we want the immediate thrill of clearing Senator Bolkus, as I believe the report does, breach a major principle. That is not the basis of good government. It is a pity-or maybe it is a good thing-that there is only one person on the Opposition side who has ever been a Minister. I am sure that in his day he would not have tabled documents capriciously just on the basis of immediate political gain. We do not intend to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the offer made by the Prime Minister is correct. Seeing other people are involved in this, there is no inhibition to adding Senator Powell's name to that list so that she can go and read the document but she should treat the commercial-in-confidence as confidential. I dare say that, if those opposite are not satisfied with that process, they will use the forms of the chamber to pursue this matter in another way. I can neither prevent nor anticipate that. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on the point that this Government will not be party to preaching that. Having read the document, my view is that firms would have an enormous advantage if they knew what others had quoted. That would do the tendering process--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a couple of honourable senators have already said, events have moved fairly rapidly this morning. I have noted Senator Robert Ray's comments subsequent to Senator Parer notifying me of correspondence between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Dr Hewson. Obviously, having had a claim by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) of commercial confidentiality of certain documents, that subsequent correspondence is significant. Senator Hill has made the point that there may be aspects of the relevant documents which are commercial-in-confidence and that other aspects may not be. As has already been pointed out under other processes, such documents with deletions are often made publicly available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this instance it is important that the relevant people involved have access to those documents and should be able to make judgments on those matters. There has been a lot of the flurry on this issue, which has largely been played out in the media. I do not want to get into questions about whether people have had documents, have had bits read over the telephone, have seen parts of them or whatever. I certainly would not stand here and mount an argument in a situation such as this based on a handful of press clippings or a television program. One would want much more detail and evidence than that. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of points are worth making. One is that the original leaks on this issue to the Opposition came from the Department of Administrative Services. Also, there have been a number of conflicting responses from the Department. We should bear in mind that the Department ranges from those senior officers who made an eventual decision, which has been made public, to support the Minister's action, down to other officers in the tendering process who had obviously made different decisions earlier. When we talk about the Department, we are not talking about just one or two people. The fact that, at different times, different points of view and different opinions have been put simply reflects the fact that they are coming from different sources within the Department. Ultimately, in our process here, it comes down to what the Minister decides. In essence, that is what the Opposition has taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the opportunity to see the documents, as the offer has been made. At this stage it is probably sensible for this chamber to adjourn consideration of Senator Hill's motion so that those documents can be viewed by the people to whom that offer has been made-Dr Hewson, no doubt Senator Parer as the spokesperson, and me. Therefore, I foreshadow that, at the conclusion of the debate, I will seek leave to move that consideration of this motion be adjourned. I do not want to prohibit the opportunity for others to speak in the debate. I will therefore move as an amendment to the motion that the debate be adjourned to a later hour this day. I do not want to put a time on it, as I am on my feet and do not have the information about the availability of Dr Hewson and Senator Parer and whether they are able to read them by a certain hour. At the conclusion of the debate, I will be moving an amendment to the motion. A claim of this kind having been made by the Minister, it is important that it be taken seriously by the responsible people. I certainly accept the offer to look at the documentation. I will then consider the question before the chamber or the possibility of any other action which might seem to us to be more appropriate in the circumstances. </PARA>

It does have a responsibility to good government in this country. As part of that responsibility, it is incumbent upon the Opposition to fairly assess the issues involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) made one very pertinent comment this morning about Senator Hill. Senator Hill has been here for as long as I have-10 years-and he has run away from everything. I realised why this morning: he just does not apply himself. Had Senator Hill listened yesterday to the answer I gave in the Senate, he would not have made some of the allegations that he made this morning. Senator Hill said that, if commercial-in-confidence had been raised yesterday, the Opposition might have looked at the matter differently. Let us have a close look at yesterday's Hansard. I made the assertion that Senator Parer a few weeks ago selectively leaked documents which can only be termed commercial-in-confidence. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Parer" NAMEID="KI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were. I later went on to say that I would not compound the felony and would not table commercial-in-confidence documents. I said that there was already too much commercial-in-confidence information in the public domain because of Senator Parer's irresponsible actions. The reality of this point is that we are talking about what Senator Parer full well knows are commercial-in-confidence documents and that Senator Hill, if he had applied himself to any degree, would have come to the same assessment. I am not the person who put the stamp on them. That was done by those people involved in the process. Had Senator Hill been decent and honest about this, he would have read the brief from yesterday and would not have asserted this morning that commercial-in-confidence was not mentioned yesterday. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, there is a massive misunderstanding on Senator Hill's side of the chamber. I am sorry that I have to go through this point by point to reinforce the case. Senator Hill spoke about the Nashua Australia Pty Ltd contract. I made it very clear yesterday, and I will make it very clear again today, that my intention all along in this process has been threefold: firstly, to get the best value for money; secondly, to ensure that Australian suppliers are given a solid go; and, thirdly, to ensure a fair tendering process. I also made the point yesterday-and it is one that Senator Hill missed, despite the fact that he is sitting three yards away from the Government benches-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In this particular case, the cheapest tenders were not, in all cases, accepted. This was the result of the methodology used; this was the basket approach that was adopted. The average price of four products was assessed without weighting being given to items likely to be procured in greater volumes. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill made a great point this morning about Nashua being allowed in after the close of tenders. I went on to make two points about this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . one of its products which failed to get on the contract was in fact 35 per cent cheaper than another supplier's successful product. By any measure, that was a sign that the taxpayer was not getting the best value for money and the best price.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a point made very clearly yesterday and it is one that Senator Hill should have taken into account before he came in here today. I also said in my answer yesterday that one company was added to the standing offer after the close of tenders. I said that I was concerned that there had been no post-tender negotiations with Nashua and others, although one supplier was given a second chance and was subsequently put on the panel. It happened without my intervention, and I mentioned that yesterday. But did Senator Hill take note of that before he came in here today? Not at all. He has no understanding of the issue. He has failed again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the close of tenders another company was put on the tender panel. Senator Hill has a lack of understanding and application and a lack of wanting to appreciate the issues in this case. Senator Hill's third point was that if Nashua was put on, why not others? Once again, what did I say yesterday? I do not know where Senator Hill was during Question Time yesterday, but I made it very clear that I was advised to put Nashua on the panel for its price competitive products as well as several other suppliers disadvantaged by the methodology of the tendering process. Had Senator Hill been listening yesterday, had he applied himself overnight and had he been diligent and taken care before coming in here, he would have realised that the other companies that were disadvantaged were going back onto the panel. Three basic points which are fundamental to Senator Hill's argument have somehow managed to escape him. It is quite easy to understand why they have escaped him: he is driven by inadequate research and one lust, which is not for responsible government. We have had the press statements put out by Senator Parer. One was put out yesterday headed, `What has Bolkus Got to Hide'. I honestly have nothing to hide, and I say that very clearly. That is why we are being open with the Opposition and totally responsible. Senator Parer says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It can only be assumed that the report is in fact critical of the Minister's role in this incident. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A little bit-he is pretty modest about it. But any degree of commercial background would lead him at least to recognise that, when we are dealing with these sort of contracts, commerciality is important. If it did not come to Senator Parer of his own volition, the fact that it was rammed down his throat three times in Question Time yesterday should have got through to him. It should have got through to the Opposition leader, but it did not at all. Neither did it get through to the political butterfly of Australian politics, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who just flits from one issue to the other, taking the advice of also-rans. It is a bit harrowing going out to the electorate these days, as it has been over the years, but when I come into this Parliament and look at the quality of the other side, I am reassured that the Government is in with a fighting chance at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition senators-Ha! Ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition senators may very well laugh, but who laughed the Christmas before the last election? We have here a case of intervention by a Minister in a contract which is his legal responsibility. Let us get that straight. It is my legal responsibility and I have delegated my authority. If I were not taking an interest to ensure that the tendering process was fair and accurate, I would not be doing my job. If I were not replying and taking an interest to ensure that Australian products and Australian suppliers were given a fair go in government contracts, I would not be doing my job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can understand Opposition senators not understanding that concept because they have consistently and publicly argued against Australian companies in their campaigns. But it does not stop the Greiners and other members of the Opposition, and it does not stop Senator Boswell coming in wanting to protect Australian pineapples. Opposition senators all write to me wanting me to ensure that Australian suppliers are given a fair go but, when it comes to doing something, they run away from it. The Opposition should go back to the companies we represent here and tell them that it does not think Australian companies and suppliers should get a fair go in the process. The Opposition should go back to them and tell them why it is not supporting Australian suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation was driven in the first instance by the need to ensure that Australian suppliers got a fair go and by the need to ensure that the taxpayer was paying the best price. As I have already shown, on at least on the best price argument--</PARA>

It is a document that we are not allowed to see. The Minister claims that that is on the basis of commercial-in-confidence. I will come to that matter later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning I want to deal with six points raised by Senator Robert Ray and three raised by Senator Bolkus that go to this argument. The first relates to interjections by Senator Ray to some of my colleagues in the National Party of Australia and, certainly, to my colleague Senator Macdonald about the tendering processes in Queensland, which interjections sought to associate those honourable senators with what has happened in the past in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the best form of defence is attack, but I think it is a pretty low level attack and one which does not offer any substance in this argument. For example, because I know by Brian Burke's own admission that he has taken $18,000 worth of stamps that are Australian Labor Party stamps and has mixed them in with those in his own collection, I do not suggest for one minute that Senators Giles, Cook, Beahan, McKiernan and Walsh are guilty of the same crime. Because Brian Burke had Brenda Brush collecting hundreds of thousands in dollars and carting that money around Perth in a bag or a suitcase, I do not say that Senators Giles, Cook, Beahan and McKiernan do the same thing. It is a preposterous allegation to be making. It is absolutely preposterous to suggest that because somewhere there is a defalcation in a process everybody else of that political persuasion should be judged accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the way that Senator Robert Ray wants to play it, that is fine. I do not think that is what he really wants. I think that was just a simple cheap debating point. If there is any impropriety on this side of the chamber, in the Australian Democrats or on the other side of the chamber, let us talk about that impropriety as it relates to this chamber and this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives this chamber no credit to simply get into a slanging match about what somebody's colleague in another State has done. Having regard to what has been going on in Western Australia, I would have thought that the whole of the other side of the chamber-in particular the Western Australians-would not want to hear an allegation that they mix up their funds, that they know which is their private money and which belongs to the Labor Party. It would be outrageous to make an allegation that they were collecting stamps and ferreting them home. We do see anyone on this side of the chamber making that sort of cheap debating remark. It is not one that befits someone such as Senator Robert Ray, who normally makes a more sensible contribution than that.</PARA>
<PARA> A subsidiary point is the allegation of both Senator Robert Ray and Senator Bolkus about the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, when they said, `I haven't seen you come in here on some tough and difficult issue'. I remind them of several occasions on which Senator Hill has made difficult decisions, where he has chosen, after much consideration, to part company with the rest of his colleagues. That is never an easy decision and is one which Senator Bolkus has never ever made. Senator Bolkus just goes along with the group line. I well know what happens to Labor Party people when they disagree: look at what happened to Senator George Georges. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Bolkus of those occasions. Senator Bolkus might raise them as soft issues. As I recall, one of them was a tax matter, which I do not regard as being a soft issue. If one makes the allegation that someone is weak and he is weak, that is fair enough; if he is not weak, the debate is only cheapened by making the allegation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that Senator Robert Ray made was that Senator Bolkus was entitled to defend himself on the 7.30 Report on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), that he was entitled to do so because Dr Hewson raised the matter, and, because Dr Hewson raised the matter, ipso facto, everything else was okay. That is just manifestly ludicrous. The fact that someone raises an allegation does not entitle that person to go tittle-tattling off to the press, letting it see bits of documents that the Government will not put before Parliament and using bits and pieces to justify the claim. It is absolutely outrageous to suggest that, just because an allegation is made, the manner in which the allegation is answered should not be open to question. That is what we are doing today: we are questioning the manner in which these allegations have been answered. </PARA>
<PARA> We are saying that it is not good enough to go off to the ABC and give it, in whatever form it was given, bits and pieces of a document that the Government will not let the Parliament see. That is the whole focus of the debate. The allegations have been raised. We are not happy with the way in which they have been answered. We do not believe that a secret document does that. Consequently, the point made by Senator Ray fails. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray also said that the ABC was not given the document. I noticed that he avoided making any remarks as to how Mr Lyneham, and the other reporter from the Canberra Times, got his information. The Government has been strangely silent on this. Is it suggesting that some junior official in the Department of Administrative Services has leaked this material in defence of his Minister? Why did Senator Bolkus not tell us what information he was prepared to give to Paul Lyneham and if he was prepared to let Paul Lyneham see the full contents of this report?</PARA>
<PARA> It is just not good enough to come in here and say in a very technical sense, `Well, no, these documents have not been given to the ABC', without telling us how it is that the ABC and the Canberra Times know more about these documents at this stage than the Parliament does. That is just an inadequate defence to offer. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point, namely, that the ABC has not been given these documents, raises the fourth point in Senator Ray's comments. The Minister under question at the moment, Senator Bolkus, proposes to ban political advertising on the electronic media. He says that we should all be satisfied with that, that members of the public should be satisfied with that, because through the electronic media they will find out what is going on in politics. They will be able to find out what Labor Party policies are, what Liberal Party policies are, what Democrat policies are, because the electronic media will tell them. The electronic media will tell them the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we are being asked to believe that the 7.30 Report ran a program in defence of a Minister without having access to the entire document on which the Minister seeks to rely. I think that that is a pretty solid damnation of the ABC and its practices. The Government is saying that it can just go to the ABC and say-nudge, nudge, wink, wink-`We cannot show you the whole thing. Here are the good bits. Run a program in favour of us'. I think that is what it is saying; it is saying that the ABC has not been given these documents. Senator Bolkus is saying that it has not been given the documents, but it has managed to gets bits of them. Somehow, you and I, Mr Deputy President, and members of the public are meant to believe that the ABC had full knowledge of what was in those documents without being given them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister comes here on another occasion and says, `But you can rely on the electronic media to tell you the truth'. Those propositions do not sit happily together. Either the ABC has been given or shown these documents, or it has run a program without having full access to them. That says something about its own competence. It certainly says something about the propriety of the Minister's plan to ban political ads on the electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point I raise is the offer to Dr Hewson and Senator Parer to look at these documents so that they will appreciate the meaning of `market-in-confidence'. This is yet another example of a typical attitude by the Labor Party that what government and the Parliament are all about is the Executive. In other words, if the Minister and the Prime Minister agree that something is the case and if the equivalent shadow Minister and the Leader of the Opposition agree that it is the case, then you, Mr Deputy President, and I should be quite happy with it. So Senator Powell need not bother getting elected; the Democrats need not bother coming. If this is just an Executive-to-shadow Executive bunfight and the backbenchers, the independents and the small parties are just here to go along with whatever the Prime Minister and Senator Bolkus choose to say, in agreement with Dr Hewson and Senator Parer, then the rest of us may as well pack up and go home. If that is the case, this whole institution is a gross waste of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one never have and never will totally give the right to speak on my behalf to my Leader. The day that happens is the day I should give up my job. If I went to South Australians and said, `Elect me; I will go along with whatever the leader of the day says', I would not get elected and nor should I. That is the fundamental problem with what the Government is offering. It is offering Executive-to-shadow Executive chitchat over a cup of tea or a couple of beers and that is totally inadequate. Parliament is here to scrutinise the Executive. That includes the backbenchers, the Democrats-and I regret that on some occasions-and the Independents. Decisions are not meant to be made through Executive-to-shadow Executive chitchat. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of commercial-in-confidence. This question has been raised in Estimates committees and it comes up again and again. Whenever the Government does not want to tell anyone what a boo-boo it has made, it just says that something is commercial-in-confidence; a third party will be hurt. Of course, anybody who is reasonable does not want to put third parties at risk in the examination of what the Executive is doing. Therefore, there is a tendency to say that if something is commercial-in-confidence, it is okay. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have seen that happen before. It is the greatest trick in the book, used to cover up some evil. It happened with the ABC. When it was asked what Geraldine Doogue was paid-some people had a particular interest in the substantial salary that I believe she was paid-the ABC slipped clauses into its contracts which said that these matters were in-confidence and so the parties to contracts would not release the details of them. That meant that taxpayers who wanted to know whether the ABC was wasting their money would not be able to find out. They would not be able to find out whether Geraldine Doogue was being paid $500,000 a week. It is manifestly ludicrous to claim baldly that commercial-in-confidence means that the Parliament is not entitled to know about a matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As outlined by Senator Hill, the proper course of action is that these documents be shown to the Opposition and the Democrats and that some agreement be arrived at as to how any items in the documents that might affect third parties can be taken out. That offer was made by Senator Hill when he first got up to speak this morning. We are not seeking to have the whole lot. It has been indicated that there are some commercial-in-confidence matters in the document and it has been indicated on our behalf that we would be happy to have those parts taken out. But we want an undertaking that when they are taken out, this document will be tabled. That is all I care to say about the remarks of Senator Ray. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to some of the remarks made by Senator Bolkus. The Minister said that he was on about `good government'-another motherhood phrase drummed up by the Minister so that everyone will say, `That is a good thing; Senator Bolkus is in favour of good government'. But he did not go on to explain why it is good government for him, in order to defend his case, to be able to give titbits to the ABC and the Canberra Times and then come in here and say that there is some in-confidence report, a secret report of his Department, which justifies his actions. If he thinks that that amounts to good government, I would like to see him debate it. That is his definition of good government-a Minister being able to come in here and say, `I know I interfered with the tender process, but it was a good idea. The Department has this secret report and it says that it is all okay, so the rest of the Parliament can go home; it is okay'. That is not what good government is about. If Senator Bolkus goes and asks primary schoolchildren, they will tell him that. Good government is not parliament simply accepting what the Executive says. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says that he wants responsible government. That is what we want; we want the Minister to be responsible for what he has done. We want him to table these documents so that we can see whether what he says is true. If it is true, well and good; he will get the Parliament's backing. </PARA>
<PARA> I should not need to repeat-but I do-that there has been an undertaking that any in-confidence matters in the document that might affect third parties would be excluded. So all we are asking is that once third parties are not at risk, we want to see this report that the Minister says justifies his actions. That gives credence to our jobs. We have no credence if we do not seek that. This place has no credence if it does not get that by virtue of the numbers; if it just takes what the Minister says as being the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says that his actions in meddling in this process are justified because he wants to ensure that the tender process is fair and accurate. I understand that a huge wad of guidelines exist on the tender process, arrived at after many years of constant debate. As Senator Hill said, these guidelines can always be improved. No-one believes that the Government tendering processes are perfect; they can always be improved. But Senator Bolkus seems to be saying that, irrespective of the guidelines-do not worry about what they say-he, Senator Bolkus, the possessor of all knowledge of what is fair and accurate, can bypass these guidelines and with his personal intermeddling he will ensure that we get a better result. </PARA>
<PARA> That is simply not an appropriate course of action for a Minister to be taking. If he thinks that the guidelines are inadequate and that he has some better way of going about it, he should seek to have the guidelines changed. He should not just personally intermeddle in matters to get what he sees as a better result. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if it were the case that in this one instance his intervention resulted in a fairer response to the tender process, surely we are not going to say, `Well, that is okay. As a Minister, you can continue to meddle all you like'. We then have to say that we believe he is the possessor of all knowledge of what is fair and accurate, and I for one do not accept that. I imagine that a few other people here do not accept that either. I am pretty damned sure that there are a few honourable senators on the Government side who do not accept it, either. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is not good enough to say, `In this case doing the wrong thing was okay because a fair and accurate result was achieved'. If the process is wrong, the process should be fixed up. Because the Minister gets caught up in his own argument, he thinks it is appropriate that he intervene to get a fair and accurate result. Yet, in the same breath-standing right next to that argument-the Minister puts forward another argument-that his actions are justified because there is something wrong with the tender processes in the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand the Minister says, `I am the Minister and I can intermeddle because I keep things fair and accurate' and, on the other hand, he says, `But, you know, sometimes I do not intermeddle properly and the tendering process has not been followed properly'. He cannot have it both ways. If he wants to say he is the responsible Minister and his intermeddling fixes things up, how does he explain the existence of a secret report that says he has not, on a number of occasions, fixed things up? The arguments do not sit happily together. The reason they do not sit happily together is that they have been cobbled up at the last minute. The Minister was skulking around in the corridors hoping to get out of having a debate while someone could write a speech for him. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing I want to say about the contribution by Senator Bolkus relates to another motherhood statement. Firstly, the Minister said, `I am in favour of responsible government', without any adequate explanation of why it is responsible for him to meddle in tender activities. Secondly, he said, `I am in favour of fair and accurate tender processes. Therefore, go along with me'. The Minister gave no adequate explanation of his intervention there. Thirdly, he said, `I am in favour of buying Australian. We all like kangaroos, boomerangs and anything else Australians produce, so you should be happy with my interfering in this process so that we can buy Australian'. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who support the concept of buying Australian do not think that buying Australian means that the Minister should be allowed to intervene at will on behalf of Australian products. We do not mean that at all. We mean that, where the Australian product is as good or is better, and the price differential is not substantial, one should buy Australian. We do not mean that Ministers should have a licence to intervene at will. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward this afternoon to the result of Opposition senators having had a look at these documents. I sincerely hope that we can come to an agreement whereby those parts of the documents that might prejudice third parties can be taken out and the remaining parts of the document, which the Minister says justify his actions, can be tabled in this place. Anything less than that really means that Parliament has simply become government of the day, executive to shadow executive and the rest of us may as well go home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue arose out of a proper question asked by the Opposition and a proper answer. In his answer, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) quoted from a document. The Opposition, quite properly, asked the Minister to table that document. On the basis of his assessment, the Minister properly declined to do so. As a result, a debate is under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is proper for a Minister, on occasions, to decline to table a document. I say that on the basis of what this chamber has done in the past and on the basis of the Standing Orders under which it operates. The longer I am a member of this place the more impressed I am with the good sense of those who preceded us and, of course, with the good sense of present senators. Standing order 168 states:</PARA>
<PARA>A document relating to public affairs quoted by a Minister may be ordered to be laid on the table, unless the Minister states that the document is of a confidential nature or should more properly be obtained by address. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a good speech, too. It properly put forward the fact that no information should be denied to this chamber on a prima facie basis; that Parliament should have all the information that it wants-not only that it needs but that it wants-and, indeed, that there should be free debate and free discussion across this chamber. There is nothing constitutionally to stop it getting that sort of debate. Indeed, the privilege we have against being sued for defamation for whatever we say in this chamber is another indication of how it is right and proper that debates should go across the chamber based on full facts and based on a situation where nobody can be sued for libel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, if we have got these incredible privileges-and they are incredible privileges-we should use them responsibly. If in the course of a debate we damage people outside this chamber who do not have a proper means of vindicating themselves, we act irresponsibly. That does happen in this chamber from time to time and we have got procedures in place to correct it. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened here is that there has been a dispute about whether or not this document ought to be brought forward. What Senator Powell is very sensibly going to do is to suggest that people look at it to see whether or not the debate should go forward to the point where a motion is passed compelling that production. For the life of me I cannot see what is wrong with the process that has been pursued so far and why anybody should be getting disturbed about a very proper course that has been taken to date. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, if everybody in the chamber were given a look at the document to see whether or not it is of a confidential nature, the confidentiality would disappear. That is the problem with making this document available to the Senate generally. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. What he did was to give an answer which is regularly given by Ministers in this chamber. We have been here again and again when there has been a request for a Minister to table a document and the Minister has declined on the basis of standing order 168. It is hard to see how we can say that a Minister is treating the Parliament with contempt when he is simply relying on the orders that this chamber has made-on standing order 168, which has been made by and has become a traditional part of and a traditional rule used in this chamber. It is impossible to accuse the Minister of acting irresponsibly or in contempt of Parliament or of this chamber when he pursues a course of action which is set out for him by the chamber. In other words, we cannot be contemptuous of a chamber which has given us rules which we have to follow. So the Minister has acted very properly in all of this. To repeat myself-but it is a point worth making-the very reason we have standing order 168 is to meet the very situation we have here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The way around it, of course, is not to rely on what the Minister says. We are not relying on what the Minister says. We are relying on people from the various parties represented in this chamber having a look at it and saying, `Well, yes, we understand what you said, Minister; we accept what you say and we will go on from there' or saying, `Look, we do not accept what you are saying', and then to take the next step. </PARA>
<PARA> The preliminary step that has not been gone through yet is the decision of whether or not this document is of a confidential nature. Until that is decided it seems that the rest of the rhetoric that the Opposition has engaged in is premature. It is my view that we should proceed as soon as pos- sible to the proposition that is about to be put by Senator Powell and go on from there. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been shown in this debate is that the Minister has not acted improperly in any way; he has acted responsibly and has simply made use of the orders that this chamber itself has established. The proper carrying out of those orders is the next step that we have to take and that can be done by the leaders of the various parties having a look at the document and for us to see what happens from then on. Otherwise, we are jeopardising-or may be jeopardising-the commercial viability of all sorts of companies which cannot properly put their defence in the chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me fairly harsh of us to go on demanding this document before the leaders have had a look at it because, if we were all to look at it, the very purpose of the order and the very purpose of confidentiality would be defeated and people could be seriously injured. </PARA>

<PARA> We have already seen this morning how the Minister set out to mislead the Parliament. If the Minister would stop chatting across the table I am certain he would be interested in this. This is how this Minister set out this morning to mislead the Parliament, as he did yesterday. He suggested that what he was trying to do with Nashua was nothing more than what had happened to another supplier. He said another supplier was given a second go. I quote from his answer in yesterday's Question Time:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . one supplier was given a second chance and was subsequently put on the panel after the close of tender. </PARA>
<PARA>He repeated it this morning, saying that Senator Parer did not understand because he had not listened and had not understood the burden of this comment by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Minister does not understand is that the tender procedures, as they existed before his review, provide specifically for the capacity to negotiate before the tender is let, but after the tender procedure has closed. What the Minister was trying to do with Nashua was after the tenders procedure had closed and after the tender was let. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was two months after the tender was let. The one supplier who was given a second chance was subsequently put on the panel after the close of the tender but not after the tender was let. For this Minister to come in here and pretend that the Nashua fiddle that he has perpetrated is anything like giving the other supplier a second go is a disgrace. It is a deliberate attempt to mislead this Parliament and this Minister should apologise to this place for doing so, because the facts-they are revealed in the document that Senator Parer tabled-are these:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Post offer negotiation-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, before the granting of the tender-</PARA>
<PARA>involves independent discussions with one or more potential suppliers to clarify, reach agreement on or settle terms after bids (i.e. quotes, offers, proposals, or tenders) have been received and before a contract is formed. The aim is to improve those bids and clarify uncertainties through a structured and ethical process. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the other tenderer went through-the one that Senator Bolkus now cites to defend himself-but Nashua and Senator Bolkus did not go through a structured and ethical process. This Minister took Nashua through an unstructured and unethical process. He demanded that Nashua be put on the list two months after the contracts had been let. </PARA>
<PARA> For this Minister to pretend there is any similarity between the other contractor who was given a second go and Nashua is a disgrace. If he seeks to mislead the chamber like this I am certain that his status, which is already appallingly low, will go even lower in this place. </PARA>

<PARA> In fact, what the Minister is now stating by his actions is that an Australian supplier can have a special second go. In other words, it can put in a tender bid at a high price, aiming to rip off the Australian taxpayer, knowing that, under the Bolkus rules, if it misses out it can come again at a lower price. In other words, if it gets away with the attempted rip-off-great-the taxpayers of Australia have to foot the bill. If it does not get away with the attempted rip-off, Senator Bolkus will help it to get the tender. That is what the simple consequences of this situation really are. I must say that there are also some, I believe, clear attempts to mislead the chamber on this matter, because Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA>I was informed of the results of the review-</PARA>
<PARA>this is by the Department-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . and was advised, both in writing and verbally-</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose he means orally. Maybe the writing was not in words; it might have been in hieroglyphs-</PARA>
<PARA>that I should act and not let the status quo continue. </PARA>
<PARA>We recognise that that was long after Senator Bolkus had already acted without advice-in fact, contrary to the advice. This is the important matter. The suggestion made by Mr Lyneham in his questioning of Senator Bolkus was quite interesting. Senator Bolkus was asked this by Mr Lyneham:</PARA>
<PARA>I mean, any Ministerial fingerprints on it anywhere?</PARA>
<PARA>This is about the internal inquiry. Mr Lyneham said:</PARA>
<PARA>And now you've had, or they've had, an independent internal inquiry that says, basically, you were right and they were wrong. How independent was this. I mean, any Ministerial fingerprints on it anywhere?</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to Senator Bolkus's response. Does he say, `No, there were no ministerial fingerprints on it anywhere'? Not on your nelly. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, let me say the matter was brought to the attention of the Secretary and the Deputy Secretaries involved. </PARA>
<PARA>By whom? When? It was certainly brought to their attention. In other words, the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary of the Department knew perfectly well that the Minister had gone out on a very public limb at this stage and had written a very strong letter demanding that Nashua be reinstated. Obviously, the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary would have faced a very difficult situation indeed if, after that event, they had come up with something that had no ministerial fingerprints on it anywhere. Senator Bolkus then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>They went through it with me, very exhaustively, and I think they felt very strongly that, in fact, I'm sure they felt very strongly, independently of any view that I might have had, that the process really had to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA>All this suddenly happened after the Minister had written demanding that Nashua be added in an arrangement which had offended the operatives in the Department, and in a system that clearly broke the accepted rules. The Minister cannot possibly claim that the other tenderer had not fitted the rules. It clearly did. Senator Bolkus said he felt that the departmental officers were strongly and independently of a view. If Senator Bolkus could say with honesty that there were no ministerial fingerprints on it anywhere, why did he not say that to Paul Lyneham?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The interesting thing is that Senator Bolkus says that this team was set up `because senior officers felt that the processing in this particular area . . . had to be looked at exhaustively'. They only got this feeling after Senator Bolkus said that, against all the rules, Nashua had to be reinstated. Is that not a magic and extraordinary situation! We have, firstly, Senator Bolkus being totally wrong about the other firm, making a quaint suggestion that he felt maybe it was independent and that it had come to this determination independently. Then, of course, he also seeks to mislead us on the question of the average price of the four products. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The average price of four products was assessed without weighting being given to items likely to be procured in greater volumes. In fact, in Nashua's case-the case that got some publicity-one of its products which failed to get on the contract was in fact 35 per cent cheaper than another supplier's successful product. </PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Bolkus is going to give us these exciting little glimpses of information, how about he tells us the full story. How much of the contract is to be made up of the items that are 35 per cent cheaper? In terms of volume, to what extent does that have any real impact on the final outcome?</PARA>
<PARA> Here we get this little suggestion that maybe it was in Australia's best interests to pay more to Nashua, to give Nashua a second chance, because one of its items was 35 per cent cheaper. But unless we have the letter, unless we know the facts and can reveal those facts, we have to put up with the sort of deliberate misleading of this place which has already been demonstrated here today. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the reasons why we must have the documents. We must have access to them so that information will be available for us to dispute and deny the propositions that Senator Bolkus has put up clearly in quite a mischievous way at some stages to mislead the Parliament and the people. I notice, too, that Senator Bolkus in Question Time yesterday said:</PARA>
<PARA>It has to be understood also in this context that suppliers can and do change their prices after these standing offers are issued.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>This is specifically provided for in the tendering document.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that Nashua, as a previous supplier, had often reduced its prices in favour of the Commonwealth during previous contracts, as have other suppliers. I am advised that such price reductions are proper. I would be astounded to know when price reductions have not been proper. That is an extraordinary and nonsensical comment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the regular suppliers to departments, Dysan, a supplier of magnetic tapes, missed out on being one of the successful four tenderers. That is revealed in Inside Canberra. It missed out purely on price. But the people using the equipment are unhappy about changing from Dysan. They apparently have some problems about quality and supply. As Inside Canberra points out, if it is in Australia's best interests to reopen the Nashua application, why does the Government not reopen everything? You cannot have one without the other without destroying the integrity of the tender process. This Minister has not demonstrated, at any stage, why Nashua alone should have its tender re-examined, and why the benefits that he says come to an Australian manufacturer of having it done are not massively outweighed by the damage done in terms of the cost to the taxpayer and the destruction of the tender process by what the Minister has done. The facts are that he may get a cheap shot; he may get a quick trick. He may be able to wave his hands, as he has here, saying, `All I was doing was trying to give a benefit to an Australian supplier'. </PARA>

The actions of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) in this case have certainly put the tendering system in jeopardy, and maybe in jeopardy forever. So if there is any question whatsoever that the tendering process has been compromised in this case, the document must be tabled. Of course, commercial confidentiality must be addressed.

Commercial confidentiality must be supported; but when it comes to a case of wrecking a tendering system that has been the cornerstone of public purchasing in Australia, we must examine the matter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many honourable senators will have received petitions and letters, not only from children but also from adults around Australia, protesting at the way in which the walls of death driftnet fishing method captures dolphins in those nets and leads to their strangulation and death. Many thousands of dolphins die annually in this infamous fishing practice. Therefore the Australian Government has decided to introduce a mandatory labelling system for all canned tuna products sold within Australia. Obviously, this will capture those products that are imported from overseas and those which are processed within Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This will allow consumers to use their purchasing power in our supermarkets and in the marketplace to ensure that processed tuna purchased in Australia is not such that it involved the killing of dolphins by the use of a fishing method as horrendous as the walls of death driftnets. We have agreed to introduce a scheme for the compulsory labelling on all processed tuna sold in Australia. This will mean that all cans of tuna must show either a positive statement such as `dolphin safe', `dolphin friendly' or something similar, or a negative statement to the effect that the container may contain tuna which has been caught by a method which harms dolphins. I expect the regulatory machinery for the new labelling regime to be in place by the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> This will provide significant information to consumers in the supermarkets in the marketplace to enable them to use their purchasing power to carry their environmental concerns into positive effect. Certainly, Greenpeace, the consumer organisations, the tuna fishing fleets based in Australia and the importers and processors have all been on a working party advising me in this respect. I pay tribute to them in coming to this particular recommendation, which I have accepted.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that consumers want to have this sort of information to enable them to make decisions which will favour the fishing methods for tuna which do not endanger the lives of dolphins. By the end of this year or sooner, I believe, because of pressure in the marketplace, this information will be available to them as they carry out their weekly shopping.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to constant Government statements that Mr Brian Burke was not sacked as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See but in fact resigned. As this assertion leads to the conclusion that the sum of $28,000 to be paid to Mr Burke is not a termination payment but some form of ex gratia or act of grace payment, and given that such a payment can only be made pursuant to section 34a of the Audit Act, I ask the Minister to inform the Senate how he will be able to pay the money to Brian Burke, as he promised, when section 34a (1) requires that such payment must be authorised by the Minister for Finance or his appointee and when, in answer to my question on this matter in Estimates Committee A on Monday morning last, Mr Pat Barrett, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Finance, replied:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The payment in question is not an act of grace payment in the way that Senator Bishop is describing it. The payment in question, as I have made perfectly clear, was determined pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Governor-General quite specifically in the context of this appointment, and there is similar authority in respect of other such appointments, to determine the terms and conditions of the employment as ambassador. The language of the determination that I made is open-ended to the extent that in the last paragraph it makes provision for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade-not the Minister for Industrial Relations, as Mr Peacock in his gloriously inexact account of the law involved here intimated, but me-within the context of that determination itself to make any appropriate determination relating to matters of terms and conditions. Even if it were thought that that particular paragraph-and the document has been tabled in Estimates-was not so explicit, the open-ended authority vested in me by the Governor-General confers ample authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was the view of my Department in written advice that I received on this matter. That has been confirmed subsequently by advice from the Attorney-General's Department. There is no question but that the payment in question was properly made-not only properly made legally speaking, for the reasons I have just indicated, but also properly made in all the circumstances of the case, for the reasons that were well articulated by Mr Costello at the time of the Estimates Committee.</PARA>

In the recent Budget the VAT rate was increased from 15 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Looking at the situation of the British economy-and they might say this about us-they had to do something. This decision underlies the contention that the Government has pointed to in the past that a consumption tax, once introduced, can become an easy out for governments not willing to take the hard decisions on the expenditure side of the Budget-a comment made by the Treasurer earlier this year and I think last year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a silly interjection, because it does not accord with the facts. The point I am making is that a consumption tax or VAT can be an easy vehicle for governments to avoid hard decisions. The general experience of other countries with consumption taxes has been for tax rates to rise, suggesting that there is every reason for concerns on these grounds. For example, the rate of goods and services tax, the GST, in New Zealand-the country on which the Opposition is apparently basing its proposed system at this stage; we do not know what ultimately will come out from the Opposition-has already increased 25 per cent since inception, from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to Senator Child's question, in the Australian context that means that a consumption tax could well become a vehicle for increasing the relative tax burden on low to middle income earners to accommodate the fiscal laxity of the coalition parties, which was so evident in the period of the Fraser Government, or alternatively to trowel tax cuts to higher income earners.</PARA>

Other than referring the question to the Minister, all I can say is that Senator Powell is quite right about the Government's announced review. Media reports have distorted the announcement of the Minister on the business migration program. We are still committed to providing an avenue for successful business people to migrate to Australia as part of the overall migration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, as honourable senators would know, a variety of allegations criticising the current program and its integrity and effectiveness have been made in the press and put to the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, which has been conducting an inquiry into the program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not making a ministerial statement. I am answering a question from an honourable senator, which I shall continue to do. The deeming rate will be changed from 10 per cent to 8 per cent. Senator Walters and some of those opposite, who were so concerned last August when the deeming announcement was made that 10 per cent would be impossible to get, now have to face the fact that there are 62 accounts around Australia offering 10 per cent at call.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That having been the case now for some time, pensioners have not had difficulty getting the 10 per cent. However, one cannot hold a rate artificially high for too long. Mind you, Mr President, rates for pensioners were artificially low for decades. Until the Government took the stance that it took last August, pensioners were always behind. For the first time in Australia's history, they have been in front of market rates and that is something of which I can be justifiably proud.</PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, since August, there has been a reduction in market rates and I think it was appropriate that the Government ought to acknowledge that. Obviously, no full rate pensioners-and they make up the vast majority of pensioners-are going to be affected by today's decision. It means that some 25,000 fewer pensioners will be affected by deeming. The rates of $20,000 for a single pensioner and $36,000 for a married pensioner couple change to $26,000 for a single pensioner and $45,500 for a married couple. These are the amounts that pensioners can have before their pension will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this will mean that far fewer will be affected; it will mean some pension increase for quite a few who will be in that category. It means that we now have a rate which I think we can maintain for quite some time and which will be reviewed twice a year. Most importantly, I think it is very close to the rate for which the banks asked. The banks had, of course, asked for a formula rate. I do not believe that we could explain to pensioners any rate that varied every month and, in some cases, every week. So I could not agree to a formula. But I have, I think, come up with a suitable compromise which, while it may not be greeted with glee by the banks, will nonetheless satisfy them.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it should also be noted that in savings terms there are far greater savings for the taxpayer in this than were estimated in the Budget. I have made the point several times in the chamber that I thought the Budget estimates were low. In fact, $95m is now the case for a full year's saving. So even though 8 per cent almost halves the amount that can be saved for the taxpayer, there will still be a saving of almost $50m, which is very close to the $56m figure in the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the audit arrangements, there is documentation bearing upon that which I am willing to table, and I will do so as soon as I can find it in the bundle of material I have with me. As I recall, that consists of an audit report of December 1989 dealing with a wide range of matters, as these do, which concluded generally that the administration of the post was perfectly satisfactory but that some attention needed to be paid to a number of specific matters, one of which was the method of recording private calls and the level of head of mission contribution accordingly for the residential phone. That matter was subsequently addressed, as will appear from subsequent documents in the mat- erial that I am happy to table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to correspondence that I have subsequently addressed to Mr Burke in this respect, I am also happy to table that. It is perfectly straightforward, drawing attention to the nature and size of the bills for both the chancery and the residence, making it clear that the level of contribution, while apparently correct in terms of the procedures that had been hitherto required and agreed upon, was nonetheless on the face of it fairly small, and seeking confirmation of the rate of personal usage involved.</PARA>
<PARA> I followed that letter of 6 May with a further letter of 7 May, which I am also happy to table, following the revelation which has been communicated to members of the Estimates Committee that a logging facility was available from 1 January last year for the residential phone, making that information available to Mr Burke and suggesting that he get hold of-and we would assist him-the call log concerned and that that might help him in evaluating his level of contribution.</PARA>

I table those documents now as requested. I would be prepared to table all sorts of things if the Opposition were sensible enough to ask for them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. In particular, if the Europeans burnt our coal, not only would it be cheaper for them, because it is mined more efficiently, but also it would produce less greenhouse gases per unit of coal. It is much more calorific in content and thus produces more energy. Therefore, Australian coal and the grades we produce in this country, compared with that produced in other countries, is a better buy for coal consuming economies than coal from almost anywhere else. That is not just simply an unashamed booster statement for the Australian coal industry; that is an objective fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the article that has been referred to. I can assure Senator Colston that the Australian coal industry is aware of the challenges presented by the advent of new clean coal technologies. The industry is also aware of the role that technology packages are likely to play in the marketing of coal, particularly in developing country markets, which, in our view, are likely to expand rapidly in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is working to strengthen our dominant world market share by providing the correct domestic industry framework with an emphasis on the micro-economic reforms that we have canvassed at some length in this chamber; it is also doing so internationally by fighting the protectionist measures that dominate or close some of the overseas markets; and it is promoting the use of coal in Australia and elsewhere in an environmentally responsible manner.</PARA>

Many items under the terms of the Florence agreement, which is an international treaty of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, with 70 signatories, have no tariffs imposed on them. They include exercise books, works of art, goods designed for people with disabilities, films and slides, scientific instruments, educational aids of one kind or another and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

Some companies seeking business in Thailand have been told that, if Australia accedes to the Florence agreement, that tariff will no longer apply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The operational plans of the Wool Realisation Commission will be reviewed, as we have announced, every 12 months. So the tax rate needed to enable the wool industry to settle its debts will, of course, be reviewed then also. I understand that our current expectation is that, based on the debt reduction schedule and a 15 per cent tax rate, the industry will be able to trade its way out in the seven-year period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are confident that the Wool Realisation Commission will be able under its operating guidelines to dispose of its wool stockpile in the seven-year period without a residual debt. The imposition of a 15 per cent tax rate, rather than the 12 per cent recommended by the Vines committee, will result in a tax higher by hundreds rather than thousands of dollars. At a time when growers will already be experiencing very tight incomes, our view would be that a few hundred dollars extra will not be the decider in terms of bankruptcies, as the honourable senator's question implies. The difference between a 12 per cent and a 15 per cent levy on growers' viability is also, in our view, insignificant in comparison--</PARA>

But I really get a sort of fruit salad of questions from these fruits over here. I am of course aware of ringspot as it has appeared in papaws, because Senator Boswell once mentioned it to me in the passage. The important point about ringspot, as Senator Boswell mentioned to me, is that it has not appeared before in south Queensland. The disease is an insect transmitted virus. There are some sources of resistance to it, but they do not exist in the commercial varieties available in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A quarantine zone which has been placed over the south-eastern corner of Queensland has slowed the spread of the disease to other papaw production areas. The papaw industry is seeking research proposals which can begin to address this disease problem. CSIRO and the Queensland Committee of Direction of Fruit Marketing are discussing the possibility of CSIRO carrying out some work on this disease. If CSIRO agrees, its scientists will probably adopt an approach involving molecular biology. This method will equip the papaw with the capability to resist the disease by inserting a reverse copy of the disease organism.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Sharp did issue a press release, I think last night, claiming that. He has kept up his extraordinary duck by getting it profoundly wrong once again. As I have said on previous occasions, Mr Sharp has now developed quite an extraordinary record: he has not issued a single public statement that has been factually correct in respect to the waterfront-not one. The inaccuracies in his statements are so great that it is very difficult to understand why he continues to do it. As I said before, he should be prepared either to do the slightest bit of homework or, if he cannot, to employ at least a research officer or a member of his staff who can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement made by Mr Sharp is absolutely wrong. It is not 300 workers that have left the industry since the reform program started; around 1,200 have actually left the industry. The facts are that 360-odd have left National Terminals (Australia) Ltd under the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority program; that 310 gangway watchmen have left the industry under the WIRA program; and that some 600 workers have left the industry over the same period of time by natural attrition-that is, by using the voluntary redundancy programs that have existed in the industry for many years.</PARA>
<PARA> Some 265 workers have been recruited under the WIRA program; some 1,000 are required to be recruited, but they are recruited on the basis that the workers who are being retired are those whom the Inter-State Commission quite sensibly found should be aged 55 and above. The new workers who are being recruited into the industry must be 30 years of age or younger. Therefore, once again Mr Sharp has got it absolutely wrong. The figure of those having left the industry is not 300 but 1,200.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have some information for Senator Reid on this matter. The short history is that expressions of interest have been called by the Department in relation to a proposed new office development in Woden. Media reports have mentioned the Australian Patent Trade Marks and Designs Office as a potential occupant. While this is valid, a number of potential Commonwealth tenants are being considered. The expressions of interest are seeking initial private sector response to the possible development and subsequent leasing to the Commonwealth of approximately 20,000 square metres of office space on block 1, section 4, Phillip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department advises that this is simply testing market reactions to the proposal. At this stage no decision has been made to enter into any firm agreement for additional accommodation in Woden arising from this proposal. The land in question is owned by the Commonwealth and it is likely that ownership of the land will be retained by the Commonwealth. A number of options in regard to the final ownership of the building would be considered, including reversion to the Commonwealth or extension of the building lease. It is anticipated that the call for expressions of interest will generate only broad design and financial proposals. These responses may lead to a more complete brief being put to the marketplace, so it is very much in the early stages.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that preliminary consultations about development guidelines were held late last year with both the Interim Territory Planning Authority and the National Capital Planning Authority and draft guidelines have been prepared.

The matter is expected to be referred for examination under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act when a FIRB application is made. The environmental implications of the proposal will then be assessed in accordance with the established processes. This assessment can include consideration of greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The following are examples of cooperation between the Federal and State governments on greenhouse gas emission issues. The Commonwealth Government's decision to adopt an interim planning target to stabilise emissions, based on 1988 levels, by the year 2000 and to reduce such emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005 has been endorsed by all State and Territory governments at the Special Premiers Conference in October 1990. The greenhouse effect is on the agenda of future premiers conferences. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is also the focus of investigation by the ecologically sustainable development strategy and Industry Commission processes currently in progress.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has a very important role in promoting awareness and in formulating a national greenhouse strategy. The challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the subject of ongoing consideration by the Commonwealth environment Minister and her State counterparts on the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council (ANZEC). ANZEC released a comprehensive discussion paper, Towards a National Greenhouse Strategy for Australia, last year.</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of reduction options will fall largely on action Ministers, such as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented. I refer to an article on page 3 in this morning's Canberra Times headed `ACT solicitor's actions morally reprehensible, says senator'. That headline is entirely accurate and everything that I am quoted as saying is entirely accurate. I do not complain about the journalistic representation of the material. I am concerned about a quote, in response to those accurate reports of my comments in Hansard, by a solicitor, Mr Brian Loftus, in defending Mr Chamberlain, also a solicitor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I expressed my concern that Mr Chamberlain had obtained $230,000 of taxpayers' money by knowingly exploiting a bureaucratic loophole and had been accurately described by a Federal Court judge as acting in a manner which was morally reprehensible. I do not change any of my remarks at all. But Mr Chamberlain's solicitor, Mr Loftus, in responding to those remarks, has claimed to be outraged that I would raise these matters under parliamentary privilege, the implication being that he is making a `coward's castle' accusation about me. </PARA>
<PARA> I think parliamentary privilege is important, but I do not think it should be misused. Because I regard the matter as one of importance to do with the social responsibility of citizens and because I do not want it to be confused by an irrelevant argument about parliamentary privilege, I want to make it clear to the Senate that those things which I said before the Estimates Committee are only a repetition of things which I said in a press release that I issued on 14 March. As it is fairly brief, I would like to read it to the Senate to make it clear that the accusation against me is entirely unfounded. The media release says:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator McMullan . . . called on a Canberra solicitor, Mr Terence Chamberlain, a resident of Mugga Way in Red Hill, who has escaped paying over one quarter of a million dollars in tax due to a clerical error, to now pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on:</PARA>
<PARA>``Having won the legal game, the solicitor now has a moral duty to the community to pay the tax.''</PARA>
<PARA>In an action by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to recover unpaid tax, a court document has mistakenly referred to the debt as $25,557.92 rather than the correct amount of $255,579.20. The courts have found that Mr Chamberlain had, knowing of the mistake, determined to take advantage of it before it was discovered, by consenting to judgment for the incorrect amount. </PARA>
<PARA>``A single judge of the Federal Court found the action of the solicitor to be `just a shabby trick and indubitably unconscionable' . . . He found the course taken on behalf of Mr Chamberlain to be the moral equivalent of larceny by a trick.''</PARA>
<PARA>``Whilst the full Federal Court found that the Deputy Commissioner is now prevented from recovering the unpaid tax on a highly technical procedural point . . . it did not disagree with the single judge's comments.''</PARA>
<PARA> ``Just imagine the public outcry . . . if the Commissioner of Taxation had been the beneficiary of the error and had stood his ground on a technical procedural point. Quite rightly, as is also quite right in the circumstances of this case, there would be outrage.''</PARA>
<PARA> ``We expect people in our society to pay their taxes so we can all enjoy the services they provide . . . and avoiding paying the correct amount of tax by shabby legal tricks is just not on.''</PARA>
<PARA>I want to take the opportunity to say that the debate about this important moral question of the social responsibility of this citizen, and all citizens, should not be diverted under the guise of an attack on me for using parliamentary privilege.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The report on the state of the automotive industry 1990 by the Automotive Industry Authority is a mixture of good and bad news. There are some encouraging comments in the report relating to the performance of the automotive industry in 1990, not just the production side but also the assembly and components side. There are some welcomed signs of improvement in the industry in terms of quality. A distinction is drawn between the quality of locally produced cars and cars produced overseas and the quality differential is not in Australia's favour. But, overall the report points to some improvements in the industry in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the report was produced before the worst of the recession hit the industry. The state of the automotive industry in Australia from the start of 1991 to date-and with the likelihood of that continuing through the remainder of 1991-is one of very considerable difficulty indeed. In fact, 1991 is shaping up to be the worst year for the automotive industry in this country for many decades. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to investment in the industry, the report states that whilst investment in the industry, or sections of it, has increased in recent years, there are doubts about the future of investment in the industry, although projections for the next three years are for further growth. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but whether this projection is realised will depend on the strategies adopted by Plan producers in response to the Government's announced policy for the industry through to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>That policy announcement, which was part of the Government's industry statement in March, was of considerable concern to the industry. The process of continual tariff reduction through to the year 2000 was announced. That was not a decision with which the Opposition disagreed. The problem with the decision was that it looked at just one side of the coin in relation to the package of measures that are required to be put in place if the industry is, as we all wish, to be profitable and thriving, albeit subject obviously to structural change that will be required over the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> For the automotive industry to be viable throughout the 1990s, and particularly to survive to the year 2000 with a very low level of protection, other pillars will have to be put in place to achieve greater competitiveness and productivity. The great tragedy of the Government's performance, and the great tragedy of its industry statement in March, was that it gave the hard side to the industry-namely, the tariff reductions-without putting any steps in place to produce the structural reform that is required in this country if we are to have viable competitive industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Without the removal of impediments and inefficiencies in the industrial relations system, the road transport system, the waterfront and shipping system, and indirect tax systems, for example, Australia's relative attractiveness as a location for investment by car companies will plummet. That is a matter of very considerable concern. It is absolutely imperative that the Government get on with the task of structural reform, a task which, up to date, it has shown that it is, regrettably, lamentably unable to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on the sixth report of the Automotive Industry Authority for 1990. This authority oversights the Hawke Government's 1984 plan for the passenger motor vehicle industry in Australia. This plan is to run until 1992. As in the case of Victoria, this plan is vitally important to my State of South Australia, which is a major producer of motor vehicles and motor vehicle components.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The authority was established by legislation in 1984. It came into force with the plan in 1985. At that time the average tariff on imported passenger motor vehicles was a massive 57.5 per cent. That was the increase in the basic price paid by wholesalers in Australia when motor vehicles were brought into this country. Under the plan tariffs are being reduced in a phased way to 35 per cent by 1 January 1992. Under this year's March statement announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), tariffs will go down further to a 15 per cent level by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the negative comments by Senator Short, last year was a better year than 1989 for the car industry. Local production of passenger motor vehicles was in fact 1.1 per cent higher than in 1989. The total level of domestic production of passenger motor vehicles was 368,000 units. The really good news in this report-I regret that Senator Short did not focus on it-is that last year, 1990, there was a 44.7 per cent rise in automotive exports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That figure of 44.7 per cent is a massive increase-Senator Chapman also comes from South Australia-in exports by one industry in this nation. It is a pity that a range of other industries were not able to lift their foreign currency earnings for this country by 44.7 per cent in one year. The value of those exports was $938m. So very close to $1 billion worth of exports is now coming out of the Australian automotive industry. Motor vehicle parts and completed vehicles are now quite a significant part of total manufactured exports. I am very pleased that the Mitsubishi Magna station wagon, which is produced in Adelaide, is now to be exported into the Japanese market, the home market of the parent company. Also, aluminium alloy wheels are being exported from South Australia, as are mirrors by Rainsfords Pty. Ltd. Of course, from Victoria Ford Capri vehicles are going into the United States of America-a very tough market for any exporter, particular one of motor vehicle components.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, I focus on the good news, and that is that, according to this authoritative report, since 1985 export sales by the Australian motor vehicle industry and component industry have gone up 112 per cent. There has been a rise of 112 per cent in car components and finished car exports in just a six-year period. The industry is also improving on the price front. In the calendar year 1990 the average price for completed vehicles went up 5.2 per cent. For three years in a row the average price of Australian produced motor vehicles went up less than the consumer price index. So the real cost of cars has been falling in the last three years. Given the Hawke Government's great achievement in getting inflation down, we will see a relatively low rate of inflation in calendar year 1991. It will be 5 per cent or lower. </PARA>

<PARA> I am also very pleased to see the reduction in the number of average faults or defects in Australian cars. This has been a key problem for the industry in the past. It is one that has to be focused on in the future because the key to success in this industry now is quality. There is no doubt from David Halberstam's landmark book The Reckoning on the rise of the Japanese car industry that a big key to that rise was quality control, focusing on quality and getting down the average number of defects and faults in vehicles. That is the way the Australian car industry has to go. The Government has to give every encouragement to reduce the number of defects and faults because with higher quality the industry will have a long term future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Airlines Ltd clause 13 statement is essentially an audit report by the Auditor-General on the financial information furnished under the now repealed Airlines Agreement Act 1981 in respect of the financial information supplied by Australian Airlines. I note that the Auditor-General in his report gave the accounts of Australian Airlines a clean bill of health. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment a little on the future of Australian Airlines, and indeed the airlines industry in Australia, in the light of the changes that are being wrought with the sale of 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and the 49 per cent sale proposed for Qantas Airways Ltd. The decision to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines is a decision with which the Opposition agrees. Indeed, it had been our policy for years to sell Australian Airlines. So really all the Government is doing in this case is once again catching up with policies that had been pursued and where the agenda had been led by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We are much less impressed with the decision to sell only 49 per cent of Qantas. There is no earthly reason why the Government should not be selling 100 per cent of Qantas. The only reason that is not happening is that the union movement and the left wing of the Australian Labor Party prevented the Government from taking the decision to sell 100 per cent of Qantas when it met at a special conference last year. That special conference of the Labor Party had great difficulty in getting up these privatisation and half-privatisation proposals respectively in any event, and this was the best that it could do. </PARA>
<PARA> Some very odd decisions were made concerning the overall sale arrangements. For example, Qantas will not be permitted to invest in Australian Airlines at this stage, and Ansett Australia will not be able to invest in Qantas. The reason for Qantas not being able to invest in Australian Airlines is one that, to a large extent, defies logic, given that at the same time Qantas's direct competitor in this part of the world-Air New Zealand Ltd-will be able to buy into Australian Airlines. There is no prohibition or restriction on Air New Zealand buying in. Why on earth are we preventing our own national carrier from having a stake in one of our major domestic airlines when we are letting any overseas airline do so? It defies logic and the Government certainly needs to describe and explain to us much more clearly than it has to date why that is the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Michael Baume said, there could be some old Labor mateship involved. Whether that is the case or not, the public certainly deserves an explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I touch briefly on another aspect of privatisation and that is the Government's decision, announced in recent weeks, to recapitalise both Australian and Qantas prior to their sale. In the present climate, that is obviously needed, but it does appear that the cost involved in outlays to the public purse could be in the order of $900m collectively. Again, the Government needs to explain the actual details more clearly than it has. </PARA>
<PARA> My final comment is on the decision by the Government to put the sale of these two airlines in the hands of the asset sales task force based in the Department of Finance. It will be treated as a straight financing operation. The asset sales task force has a very sorry record up to date on major asset sales, particularly its bungling in attempting to sell the Pipeline Authority and also to sell the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, which has not yet been sold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>In so moving, I point out that it is certainly timely that the Parliament should be addressing the very important issues that have arisen and have been addressed by Mr Justice Stewart. The report on the Kakadu Conservation Zone Inquiry is very comprehensive. Of course, we have not had time to study it in considerable detail. I also note that a report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) has been tabled today on the Kakadu conservation zone. These reports must be considered together in any decent and proper examination of the associated issues. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues must now be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Government. The economic potential of Coronation Hill is vital to Australia's economy. The interests of the Aboriginal people who have associated interests in the particular area must be addressed. The environmental issues have been a matter of controversy for some considerable time and are fully addressed in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the issue of the economic potential of Coronation Hill. It is important not to assess only the figures plucked out of the air or even used by Mr Justice Stewart. Much has been made of the net value figure of about $82m that was alluded to in the draft Resources Assessment Commission report. To concentrate on that figure alone is totally false. It does not take into account the wide effects this would have on an ongoing basis in so many other areas to do with the Northern Territory economy. In fact, it has been estimated by the Northern Territory Treasurer, the Honourable Barry Coulter, that the value of the minerals known to exist at Coronation Hill is about $500m at today's value. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also many other opportunities in this area for our overseas debt to be addressed. The economic potential flows right through the Northern Territory and national economies, and we cannot walk away from that. The benefits of salaries and other expenditures would flow through to the Northern Territory Government and to the Commonwealth Government and, of course, to all of the areas of significant infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of employment, the mining of Coronation Hill would create opportunities for about 150 people during the construction stage, about 160 people in the operational phase and about a further 200 people indirectly. The impact that would have on the Northern Territory economy and, in particular, on the employment prospects that would be made available to Aboriginal people is most important. The very important issue that we must always address is that in today's society Aboriginal people must be given full and equal opportunity to participate in all of the major and significant development projects that are under way. </PARA>
<PARA> The report seems to get hung up on the issue of Aboriginality and that concerns me greatly. The report acknowledges that there is considerable controversy between the senior Aboriginal custodians and within the Jawoyn community itself. A Jawoyn population of somewhere between 300 and 600 people will be directly affected by these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I first came to this Parliament-to the House of Representatives in 1980-I have always contended that we must not freeze Aboriginal people into the nineteenth century. Aboriginal culture is capable of evolving and of accommodating the social consequences of change. I am concerned that this particular report is hung up on the area of spirituality. We need to recognise that often the underlying factor with Aboriginal people is their fear of having to address the social consequences of change in the economy. Over the years, Aborigines at Gove, Groote Eylandt and Ranger in the Northern Territory have successfully reconciled mining with their spirituality. Mining has brought many of them a sense of financial independence which is vital to maintaining the dignity of an individual and a community. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Justice Stewart's statement that the religion of the Jawoyn Aborigines is not static and that pro-mining Jawoyn people appear to be motivated by a desire for personal and community advancement in a context of limited alternative employment opportunities and welfare dependency. It is for that reason that I consider that the Hawke Government must address this report positively and must make decisions that are in the national interest, the Northern Territory's interests and in the interests of Aboriginal people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Kakadu conservation zone inquiry final report, volumes I and II and the associated report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on the Kakadu conservation zone, to which Senator Tambling has referred, are very important reports. They are important not only in terms of the Kakadu area but also in terms of the much wider implications for the question of mining in national parks and mining associated with national parks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) last week said rather coyly that while he was opposed to mining in national parks, he felt that the solution to the problem was simply to excise those areas that are highly prospective or exploitative from the national parks and then to proceed to mine them outside the parks. That would eventually produce a series of national parks rather like a Swiss cheese. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of quite important considerations arise in relation to the question of the values of national parks. Senator Tambling just mentioned that there would be an economic benefit of $82m from mining this particular national park. It is a totally false analysis to say that one becomes wealthy by mining a mineral resource. That observation is made because the method of accounting which we use does not take account of resources in situ. When we mine a resource, we simply take the resource out of the ground and we turn into cash what is a capital asset. Once it is mined, it has gone. As Amery Loven said many years ago, `You do not develop a bank account by taking money out of it'. Nor do we become wealthy by mining; we become wealthy by the extent to which we value-add to the minerals which we get out of the ground. If we simply mine them and export them, we do not become wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the stated urgency of Australia's present indebtedness, I simply observe that we have been mining extensively in this country for well over 150 years and we are in dire financial straits with massive national debts; whereas a country such as Japan, with essentially no in situ mineral resources is regarded, by ordinary standards, as a wealthy nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us dispose of this nonsense that we become wealthy by mining our capital assets, exploiting them and simply wasting them. I draw attention to a letter which I received on 10 May from the Executive Director of the Australian Mining Industry Council, Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, in answer to a letter from me, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that you consider that minerals are non-renewable. This is not the case . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not the case-and I have taken up this matter subsequently with Mr McIntosh-and if in a finite world resources are infinitely available, I put to Mr McIntosh that resources are therefore logically infinitely available from any part of that finite resource, and he agreed. The question then arises: why do we need to mine in national parks? Clearly, under such logic it is possible to go and mine somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in relation to sustainability becomes even more urgent when one observes that if, with only about 5 per cent of Australia's land area in national parks and with less than 200 years of exploitation, it is now necessary to go into that last 5 per cent to exploit those resources, we should be thinking very carefully about whether our civilisation is sustainable at all. Quite clearly it is not. Moreover, if that 5 per cent is the only bit that we have left, we are not going to survive very long as a civilisation if that is the bit that we need to go in and exploit right now. The whole question of mining in Kakadu National Park raises some much wider issues. These are the issues that need to be thought about very carefully when the Government makes its decision in this particular case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that, in the eyes of the environmental movement, Coronation Hill and conservation zone should become a part of the wider protected area, a large part of which already has World Heritage status. As the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) report points out in the executive summary:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The dilemma facing the Australian Government is clear: should it set aside the environmental risks that cannot be eliminated, and the strong views held by the Aboriginal people responsible for the Conservation Zone, in favour of securing increases in national income of the order that seems likely from the Coronation Hill project and possibly from other mineral resources in the Zone?</PARA>
<PARA>It is a hard question. However, as the former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, stated in September 1989 when he was hell-bent on wooing green preferences, we need to get away from the mentality that we rely on Australia as a quarry. He was referring then to Kakadu as one of the potential quarries as the Coronation Hill issue was being hotly debated.</PARA>
<PARA> That is precisely the point. When the financial pressure is on, it is not sound economical or ecological management to rely on exploiting natural resources in the short term as an export oriented buffer against the recession. The Government failed the first test by allowing resource guarantees to be introduced so that Australia's native hardwood forests would continue to be used for the production of woodchips to feed pulp mills, largely overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coronation Hill decision will be the second litmus test for the Hawke Government. It faces the clearly stated opposition of both conservationists and Aborigines to a decision to mine. The decision will also be seen in the wider context of the Australian Government's support or lack of support for Aboriginal claims when they conflict with mining interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government response to the RAC report on the Kakadu conservation zone will also reveal what weight the Government affords its own Resource Assessment Commission and environmentally sustainable development processes. Is it any wonder that people are seriously questioning the value of a lengthy process of working groups, submissions and public consultation when decisions such as the enactment of the resource security legislation cut across the whole concept of ecologically sustainable development in the face of widespread community opposition?</PARA>
<PARA> The conservation movement can only hope that this economic and political expediency is not pursued over Coronation Hill. There is too much at stake in terms of the biological data in the area which has not yet been identified, and because of the immense cultural and religious meaning the area has to the Jawoyn people. The resources of the Kakadu conservation zone, including the vital catchment area of the South Alligator River, which needs to be protected as a whole, as an integral system, are not expendable because of their intrinsic conservation and cultural values. I hope that the Federal Government will concur with this position and make the right decision not to go ahead with mining. </PARA>
<PARA> But most of all, this decision will represent the potential reinforcement or destruction of community belief in the whole process of national park preservation which has been callously disregarded recently in Western Australia, with mining being allowed in three national parks under the leadership of Premier Carmen Lawrence. With a national park there can be no trade-offs to allow mining to go ahead, because the conservation movement believes that the integrity of the whole area is at stake in the ecological context. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, as the report points out, a national park is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an outstanding natural area managed by a nationally recognised authority to protect the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems for this and future generations and, to eliminate the exploitation or intensive occupation of the area and to provide a foundation for spiritual, scientific, educational and ecotourism opportunities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what national parks are meant to be all about. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The first report I have just tabled deals with Stage 1 of the redevelopment of the Singleton Military Area in New South Wales. The limit-of-cost estimate for the work is $29.3 million at November 1990 prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The works referred to the Committee comprise:</PARA>
<PARA>* living facilities for 198 staff and 552 students</PARA>
<PARA>* working facilities for Depot Company Headquarters</PARA>
<PARA>* redevelopment of roads and provision of car parking</PARA>
<PARA>* construction of new Range Control buildings</PARA>
<PARA>* extension of area engineering services</PARA>
<PARA>* site works</PARA>
<PARA>* furniture and fittings</PARA>
<PARA>The Singleton Military Area was acquired during the Second World War and some facilities from that time are still in use. Temporary facilities were constructed in 1965. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1981, the Headquarters Infantry Centre was set up, comprising some of the Corps functions previously performed in Canberra, the School of Infantry and various support units. Many of these units work in temporary, dilapidated buildings. Much of the living accommodation is below Services' Scales and Standards of Accommodation. Staff and students currently use six different messes in two different areas of the base; this is very wasteful in its use of manpower and maintenance funds. </PARA>
<PARA>The Singleton Range is intensively used and relatively small compared with other military ranges. Range Control buildings are near the centre of the Range, inhibiting optimum utilisation of the facilities. In particular, entry cannot be effectively controlled. </PARA>
<PARA>The works recommended by the Committee form Stage 1 of a plan to redevelop the whole Singleton Military Area. It is currently Army's highest priority because of the emphasis on improving living-in accommodation for all personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has taken particular note of the energy conservation measures proposed by Australian Construction Services for these works. It reiterates its belief, first expressed in its report on the redevelopment of Cabarlah in Queensland, that it should receive copies of analyses carried out on all projects referred to it, to ensure efficient energy conservation measures are included. </PARA>
<PARA>ACS intends to call tenders in a number of small contracts which should ensure a significant portion of the work is attractive to local contractors. ACS will also consult with the local Commonwealth Employment Office about the approximate numbers and mix of labour required for the project. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was impressed by the Army's `good neighbour' policy which is designed to minimise the impact of noise pollution and to ensure complaints received are promptly investigated and followed up. The base clearly has a good relationship with the local community; it is also clear there is strong support for the proposal in the Singleton area. </PARA>
<PARA>The Singleton Shire Council stressed the need for the Army to acquire and maintain an adequate buffer zone around the base. The Council has placed zoning controls to prevent encroachment by large numbers of very small land owners, and pointed to the need for consultation about subdivision proposals in the vicinity of the base. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Committee is aware that Defence policy prevents funds being spent on museums, it recommends that Defence examine ways of providing upgraded facilities for the Infantry Museum at Singleton. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would like to thank personnel at Singleton for the work that went into its visit on 31 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The second report I have tabled deals with Stage 1 of the redevelopment of the Myambat Supply Depot in New South Wales. The limit-of-cost estimate for the work is $34.4 million at July 1990 prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The works referred to the Committee comprise:</PARA>
<PARA>* construction of 30 earth-covered explosives storehouses with associated roadworks</PARA>
<PARA>* construction and extension of living and working accommodation</PARA>
<PARA>* upgrading the sewerage system and the water supply</PARA>
<PARA>* upgrading of the railway siding. </PARA>
<PARA>Army's wholesale ammunition holdings are stored in five depots in eastern Australia. These were established in the Second World War. Many of the explosives storehouses are not suitable for the storage of the most hazardous types of ammunition in accordance with the United Nations/North Atlantic Treaty Organisation principles. Many of the living and working facilities are inadequate and constitute a repair and maintenance liability. </PARA>
<PARA>Studies recommended that, in the medium terms, Army reduce its national wholesale depots from five to two; Myambat and Wallangarra in Queensland. The Committee is concerned about this decision because Myambat is in a relatively isolated location. It believes there should be a study of the costs and benefits of retaining Wallangarra as a second national wholesale depot, and that it should receive a copy of the results of this study. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was told that energy consumption for the proposed buildings will not be great compared with many military establishments. I have already referred, in my comments on the Singleton report, to the Committee's belief it should receive copies of the analyses of energy usage on all projects referred to it. The same recommendation has been made in the report on Myambat. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted the work done by Army personnel at Myambat to sustain a good relationship with the local community. It believes it would be worthwhile to hold another public meeting to explain all the impacts the proposed works will have on that community. </PARA>
<PARA>Rosemount Estates winery raised a number of concerns with the Committee, including the inclusion of land in the safety arc from the depot, the adverse impact of the destruction of explosives, the location of the sewerage plant and fires being started in the depot. Defence will advise Rosemount of the results of computer modelling which will determine the location of the safety arc; it has also ceased demolishing the explosives causing Rosemount problems. The Committee is satisfied that the sewerage plant is in a suitable location. While there have been fires in the past, depot staff take appropriate measures to reduce their causes and deal effectively with those which start. Nevertheless, the Committee has recommended Defence continue to resolve outstanding issues with the winery. </PARA>
<PARA>Works in this project will provide the most urgently needed facilities and engineering services. The project has been divided into two phases and a further stage will be undertaken, when funding is available, to complete the redevelopment of Myambat. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would like to thank personnel at Myambat for the work which went in to the visit on 30 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend both reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill 1991 is to place a chief executive officer on the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and to give effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria. This Bill gives effect to aspects of a range of reforms to the Albury-Wodonga project agreed amongst the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments as partners in this joint project. As we know, the genesis of this project was during the time of the Whitlam Administration, and Minister Uren was closely associated with the policies developed with regard to a cities commission and a different policy period relating to urban and regional development in Australia. Most of the Bill is devoted to amending the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation's membership. It introduces arrangements to separate the responsibilities of the board and the staff. The Bill replaces the full time chairperson and two deputy chairperson positions with part time equivalents, and transfers responsibility for day-to-day management to the Corporation's most senior staff member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Local government representation on the Corporation is changed from being the mayors of Albury-Wodonga to a representative of each of the councils. The amendments will enable the Commonwealth and State Albury-Wodonga corporations to produce one annual report instead of three-one for each government. Provision is being made for Corporation staff to have reciprocal mobility rights within the Australian Public Service and other statutory authorities. It was on 23 October 1973 that the then Prime Minister and Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria signed the Albury-Wodonga area development agreement. The objectives of the agreement are contained in the preamble, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the intention of the three Governments are-that a development Corporation will bring about in the Area (Albury-Wodonga), by the development of a growth complex, the creation of a city with a high quality of environment, appropriately planned and developed having full regard to human requirements and the involvement of the public; and that the development corporation, will involve, as far as possible, the established Australian, State and local government authorities in the development of the growth complex. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of Albury-Wodonga was an element of the Whitlam Government's decentralisation policy. On 21 January 1974, the Albury-Wodonga Area Development Act 1973, the principal Act, which gave effect at Commonwealth law to the agreement, was proclaimed. Complementary State legislation established separate New South Wales and Victorian development corporations. The three corporations act as one integrated Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation is responsible to the Ministerial Council on the Development of Albury-Wodonga, which comprises the Commonwealth Minister responsible for local government, the New South Wales Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, and the Victorian Minister for Industry and Economic Planning. The main function of the Ministerial Council is to supervise the development of Albury-Wodonga. In addition, the Ministerial Council has the power to give direction to the Corporation on how it performs its functions. The functions of the Corporation include: to carry out and supervise certain development works; to negotiate with Commonwealth, State and local government authorities for the purpose of arranging or providing services and facilities to Albury-Wodonga; and to create job opportunities by encouraging the setting up of industries and other investment in Albury-Wodonga. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Ministerial Council established a review committee to examine and report on the role and structure of the Corporation, as it was then some 15 years after the initial establishment. The report of the review committee, which was presented to the Ministerial Council in 1989 and approved by the Ministerial Council on 8 June of that year, is the origin of the amendments proposed in this Bill. Included are the following proposals:</PARA>
<PARA>- in the next 12 months the corporation should undergo a period of change, on the basis of a revised mission statement which would be to facilitate the continuing growth of Albury-Wodonga in cooperation with Commonwealth, State and local government and community agencies;</PARA>
<PARA>- the Corporation's new goals would be to: contribute to the physical, economic and social planning in Albury-Wodonga, in partnership with local government and the community; promote Albury-Wodonga in cooperation with appropriate agencies; and to develop and market corporation land holdings;</PARA>
<PARA>- that an Albury-Wodonga Region Planning Committee . . . be established to overview and coordinate the preparation of a regional plan covering physical and social planning in Albury-Wodonga;</PARA>
<PARA>- that the committee review the physical plan of Albury-Wodonga and once agreement has been reached on revisions to the plan, amendments to the legislation and planning be arranged and the Corporation relinquish its local planning powers;</PARA>
<PARA>* the social service program delivery become the responsibility of local government and the community. </PARA>
<PARA>* that the financial operations of the Corporation be improved through the adoption of more commercial practises; and</PARA>
<PARA>* that the membership of the corporation be restructured to comprise a part-time Chairperson nominated by the Commonwealth, two part-time State nominated Deputy chairpersons and two regional members, one from each State, agreed by the Commonwealth and States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been particularly tardy in relation to this particular piece of legislation. As I mentioned, the Ministerial Council gave approval and direction back in 1989. In effect, these amendments, which are now validating the operations of the Corporation, are arrangements that have been in place and operating since October 1990. There is also a degree of concern about the lack of Ministerial Council meetings, which average less than one a year. That is an issue which should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw that in the House of Representatives the Government also had to propose a number of minor amendments to the Bill that it put forward to the Parliament, even after such considerable time lags, delays and frustration. These amendments, introduced into the House of Representatives by the Government and now incorporated in the Bill that we are looking at here, were for the purpose of interpreting and possessing powers under the New South Wales planning legislation; a matter that had been requested by the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments that Ms Fatin introduced were to deal with the commencement of the Albury-Wodonga development agreement amendment agreement (No. 2). The Bill was initially drafted on the basis that the amendment agreement would be approved and executed prior to receiving royal assent. Any inconsistencies in the commencement of the Bill and this amendment agreement were also removed at that point. The final amendments that the House of Representatives dealt with were correcting the different use of wording in a range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has changed in regional parts of Australia since the Whitlam Administration. I am sure we would all acknowledge that not only have there been trends throughout the world with regard to regional development and regional policies in many countries but also, as technology has improved, the relationships and sociology of so many areas have also changed. We must continually address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Government has recently released an information book entitled The Rural Book, a 1991 edition, which the Government claims to be part of the country link program. That book is listed as a guide to major Commonwealth services and programs for people who live away from the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an indictment of the Government that such a hodgepodge of policies and issues has had to be pulled together in such a difficult and different form to enable people who live in regional and remote parts of Australia-areas such as Albury-Wodonga-to come to grips with the policies of this Government, which are so loose, so unstructured and so uncoordinated. It now has to issue guidelines for people as to which programs to look at and how to address the different issues. In looking at that so-called rural book-which the Government is obviously passing out as the new gospel according to Hawke, or probably according to Kerin if it were paid for through his Department-I am concerned that the Government has moved away from decent, proper coordinated policies that recognise the priorities of remote and rural Australia and has not been able to address so many issues that require policy assistance and policy help.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that any of us who represent rural and remote parts of Australia will also be well aware that the Government's mismanagement not only of the economy but also of all the social programs impacts very dramatically on the lifestyles, the budgets and the future opportunities of young people and the future generations as to where their employment opportunities will be. The fact that we are now moving to a stage when it will be necessary to accept that initiatives such as those taken by the Whitlam Government and Mr Uren are no longer relevant, and to address the areas of regional Australia and remote parts of Australia more specifically with regard to business development, social disadvantage and social welfare policies, shows that there has necessarily been a shift in so many programs. What we must ensure is that policies of government in themselves do not act as impediments to other areas of the delivery of government services. We always need to ask government: what are the roadblocks to development, whether it is on a personal level or a community level, that are placed in the way of so many communities throughout Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that the Opposition has very seriously looked at the future of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. It is important to flag that there should be a change in the structure and that Albury-Wodonga should be returned to the normal forms of administration and participation in government policies as soon as possible. With that in mind, I have circulated an amendment to add, at the end of the motion for the second reading, that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) is of the opinion that the functions of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation be phased out as soon as practicable; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) notes that the Bill does not provide for such cessation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to recognise that the Commonwealth, the State of New South Wales and the State of Victoria have all a considerable investment in the Albury- Wodonga area. We need to ensure that in the future the Commonwealth, in particular, receives an improved return on the very significant investment that it has made to the Albury-Wodonga project over time. Therefore, the Opposition will support the legislation, and I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is of the opinion that the functions of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation be phased out as soon as practicable; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the Bill does not provide for such cessation.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Tambling has rightly told us, the Whitlam Government's decentralisation policies gave birth to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. That Corporation had admirable aims-aims which to a considerable degree have been met or are being met in terms of the growth complex of the area. It is our belief that regionalism must be supported as a concept. This concept deserves support for many reasons, not the least of which are the social, economic, environmental, strategic, community and other advantages which derive from decentralisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that at the moment in our society there are also considerable disadvantages which arise from urbanisation. I will not attempt to list them all because I would be here forever, but the ones which we are witnessing more often in our society these days are the urbanisation disadvantages that are manifested in social anonymity, the alienation of people from our society, the tendency for greater crime rates in urbanised areas and the infrastructure problems-especially problems of transport, sewerage and other services. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also, of course, the plethora of environmental problems with which we are all too familiar these days. The Australian Democrats would like to see this Government encouraging regional groupings of councils and local government bodies in their cooperation with each other. Such groupings offer citizens a great deal in terms of administrative efficiency. They also offer Australia a great deal in terms of the opportunity to take best advantage of the resources that are offered by this continent. We believe that such an opportunity is not best offered by increasing urbanisation. </PARA>
<PARA> We know, for example, of the ridiculous commuter times that are suffered by residents of our major cities and that they are only really an indicator of the inefficiencies of those large cities. There are many other indicators of the ways that large cities alienate their inhabitants. Even within cities that are supposedly well planned, there are examples of compromises in living standards which are caused by the simple fact that cities are too large. Here in Canberra, only last night I heard evidence of considerable public debate about pollution caused by home heating. We often hear even in this city discussion about such matters as waste disposal, water shortages, infill housing, vandalism, transport inefficiency and homelessness-and I could go on.</PARA>
<PARA> All those issues sound quite familiar to those of us who live in large cities and they are examples of compromises which are mainly due to the size of urban areas. But I would suggest that regional groupings of councils-the regionalisation of our activities-offers us the opportunity to best use Australia's resources. Regionalisation offers us the opportunity to live in closer harmony with the country. Just as large cities alienate residents, regional centres facilitate practices which are in greater harmony with our environment. Living and working in regional centres, we have a greater opportunity to conduct or reorganise our affairs in a sustainable manner, a manner which can be continued indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take as an example waste disposal, particularly sewerage. The present system of reticulated and centralised sewage collection for Sydney cannot be continued indefinitely; it cannot be sustained. The problems with that system are directly related to the size of the collection area. The capacity to develop alternative disposal methods is simply overwhelmed by the sheer volume of matter which is committed to the present disposal methods. It is simply a matter of the inertia of size of the urban area. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that this problem is significantly reduced in regional areas. The regional areas of Australia have shown many examples of alternative disposal methods which have been developed, installed and are working successfully. I suggest that regional areas are not subjected to the inertia of size and that this allows greater flexibility in all manner of community enterprises. I refer to recreational facilities, public housing initiatives, and public transport developments. All manner of planning and development initiatives can be undertaken in a flexible manner and can take advantage of new technologies or new techniques of social organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear more these days of examples such as neighbourhood houses, community land, shared energy generation facilities, shared domestic child minding facilities, playgrounds, facilities for the elderly and the disabled-any initiatives which might involve a reorganisation of social structures or the geography of a suburb. Any of those initiatives which may require an alternative approach are more easily accommodated within an area which is not committed to existing infrastructure in the same way as are our large urban areas. I suggest that regional centres have a greater flexibility in accommodating such developments. </PARA>
<PARA> I am seeking to remind the Senate of a long-standing Democrat philosophy and policy. We support the strengthening of local governments, especially where they are based on community of interest. That community of interest could be defined as a community in geography, a climatic community, a cultural community, a social community, an economic community and so on. We believe that such a bioregional government is logical, sensible, efficient, relevant and most democratic. </PARA>
<PARA> There would be some sort of threshold or minimum population size-perhaps an optimum size, and perhaps even a threshold geographical size. I would not attempt to define that here, nor would it be appropriate in this short debate to suggest what that population size should be. I think it is sufficient to say that these are the sorts of issues which are part and parcel of the whole debate about regionalisation. The essence of this is the need that local governments and local communities have for this Commonwealth Government to encourage the process of regional cooperation between local governments. That should be done so that the decentralisation or regionalisation is not typecast by the model which was the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> With a considerable degree of agreement we accept the Opposition amendment. Although it adds to the Bill, there is not a great deal of compunction about it. It is noting and forming an opinion, but at least it indicates that the development corporation should not continue indefinitely simply for the sake of continuing the life of a quango when the aims of that authority may be better met by other means. Therefore, we accept and endorse the amendment and support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been debating the Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill 1991 dealing with one of those attempts of past decades to create a decentralised area within Australia where people could work, live and carry on their commercial trading and their social activities away from the major concentrations of population in the capital cities and major provincial centres of Australia, particularly on the south-east mainland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard from the Opposition and from Senator Bell representing the Australian Democrats their current view of the worth of a decentralised, regionalised Australia. There is much to be said for those concepts although, having heard Senator Bell waxing lyrical about the wonders of living in small centres of population away from the major urban areas of Australia, I will be heretical for a moment. I could not help thinking of a Woody Allen line when he said, `People say I should enjoy going out and sitting on a mountain top, meditating and enjoying the view. But give me the smell of bitumen any time'. I must confess that I am one of those Woody Allen people. I like big cities. I like plenty of activity and all the advantages that come from being in a city with a population of some millions, with all the excitement that goes with it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am a bit of a rager secretly, but only when I go to Sydney, never in Devonport. Nevertheless, the Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill is an essential part of the Federal Government's recognition of the fact that the original hopes, aspirations and plans for the Albury-Wodonga area have not in the event proved to fulfil those original hopes and aspirations. It has been decided that the corporation should now concentrate on the profitable development and marketing of its landholdings and keep a role in relation to the land use, social planning and economic development of the area, but on the whole hand back to the people electing their local governments the determination of much of the planning of the Albury-Wodonga area, which at present is undertaken by the corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that to use local government bodies answerable to the local electors in this way has many advantages in being responsive to those expressions of local interest and concern so that the physical and social infrastructure-roads, sewerage, open space and so on-can reflect what the people really want rather than what is imposed upon them by those who perhaps have a vision or a view as to what is good for people in a particular local government area. I am told that it is important, nevertheless, that the role of property developer should not be the sole remaining task of the Corporation. Indeed, it ought to take some responsibility for the regional planning in Albury-Wodonga. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bell said that the Government should encourage processes of regional cooperation between local governments. I believe that in a modified way that is what the Corporation will be asked to do. Rather than imposing its model of regional development on the local government areas, it will be drawing them into a cooperative style of arrangement, and collaboration between the local governments areas will, I am sure, be fostered by the Corporation. It will be its role to encourage those processes that Senator Bell correctly identified as being so important. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though the old model is being continued. The model is being changed not only to give more responsive democratic local autonomy to the Albury and Wodonga areas, but also to enable the Corporation to encourage regional cooperation. I believe that that is a worthwhile objective, and I believe that that regional planning and expertise should be made available as a service to the people of that area and not taken away from them, as would be the effect of the Opposition amendment if it were ever translated into an amendment which carried real legal force, for example, at the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council, which is made up of the cooperating governments and, I would imagine, the local governments, too-and I do not know whether Senator Bell has had an opportunity to speak with the mayors of those local government areas-would welcome the continuation of a modified role of the Corporation, as I suggest. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the continuation of the Corporation's operations will enable the Commonwealth to obtain the best return for its very substantial investment in the area. Some $120m was invested mainly in the 1970s. I believe that it is only proper and part of good policy, in the protection and management of the financial contribution which Australian taxpayers nationwide have made, that there be a mechanism to properly ensure that the assets are managed and perhaps sold or dealt with in a way which enables those Australian taxpayers to get a better return on the considerable investment in the project. Surely, the Corporation has a proper role there. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that for these reasons it would be unwise to set a date for the winding up of the Corporation. We have to see how it works in this modified fashion. I do believe that it has a role to play in the development of this non-metropolitan area of Australia and therefore I commend the Bill for the amendments it does make to the operation of the Corporation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill is a housekeeping Bill which makes amendments to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act as a result of the passing of the military superannuation benefits scheme (MSBS) legislation and for that reason I intend to concentrate today on the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has long been a need for a new superannuation scheme for Defence Force personnel, and it has long been recognised by the Opposition. Our defence science and personnel policy, which was released in November 1989, stated that we would ensure that service personnel were not disadvantaged relative to the civilian community in relation to superannuation benefits and that we would address the anomalies that existed at that time. As the military superannuation scheme does address those anomalies, I congratulate the Government for putting our policy initiatives into place. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence forces have waited long enough for treatment that is fair and equal to that of the rest the community in relation to superannuation. For too long they have had to put up with an antiquated superannuation scheme, known as the Defence Force retirement and death benefit (DFRDB) scheme, which was introduced back in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) said at a press conference in June last year, when the DFRDB Review Committee Report was released, that the DFRDB was an `illegal scheme in terms of today's superannuation standards'. The DFRDB scheme required a 5.5 per cent compulsory contribution of salary from all Defence Force personnel, but it paid no interest on those contributions. The money was not paid into an earning fund. It was paid directly into Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> For those serving for 20 years, the scheme provided a very acceptable indexed pension, and when it was introduced most people served those 20 years. Superannuation then acted as an incentive to stay in the services. However, with today's more mobile work force, coupled with declining standards within the services, people are not staying for 20 years. The DFRDB scheme has not kept up with the times. </PARA>
<PARA> A service man or woman leaving the service before 20 years, which is almost always the case for women, receives only his or her own contribution back when he or she leaves. To make matters worse, officers who leave before 20 years of service reduce their lump sum by 3 per cent for every year they leave earlier than the nominal retiring age for rank. This means that they actually retire with less than their own contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I deal specifically with the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill, I would like to speak generally about the direction in which the personnel for whom this military superannuation scheme will be applicable are heading. In just a few weeks, we are told, we will receive a statement from the Government as to the future shape of the Defence Force. The Government, however, is not prepared to take the people or the Parliament of Australia into its confidence to share in the important decision making which is now taking place. It is very important, if any major changes are being made to the defence of Australia, that the trade-offs are well understood by those who are entitled to be defended. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be told whether this review is totally budgetary driven. If so, what are we trading off in terms of readiness and capability and for what savings? We need to know how any cuts in personnel are to be achieved-are personnel being made redundant, are they to get golden handshakes or are they simply being wasted out over time? If the latter is the case, what will that mean to the morale of Force personnel if they see the Force dying around their feet? Will the units remaining be fully manned or will they continue, as now, to be seriously undermanned?</PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, is there any real growth contemplated and, if so, to what extent and in what areas? We all remember Dr Dibb and the subsequent White Paper-the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities-which was predicated upon a real growth of 3 per cent that was never achieved under Mr Beazley. What can we expect under Senator Robert Ray?</PARA>
<PARA> Will we continue to pursue a policy of a two-ocean navy? Will we continue to increase our presence in the north? If we intend to do both these things, what will be the increased pressure on the Defence budget for new facilities? What effect on manning levels will this policy have?</PARA>
<PARA> Have we re-examined the question of warning time? The debate about warning time has bedevilled defence planning and has directed attention from the main issue-that is, the need to be prepared. Like the boy scouts, our Defence Force has to be prepared. It needs to be ready to go and it needs to be able to be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the speedy response which Australia gave to the need for ships in the Gulf. But those ships had to be equipped with weapons systems and communications systems on their way to the Gulf. Not only is that not desirable but also it meant that 19 and 20 years old young men who had not been in the service for long suddenly had to turn around, on their way to war-or the possibility of war-and train on new equipment of which they had no experience. That is no way to send people to war. Unfortunately, it is exactly the situation which occurred at the beginning of the Second World War when we sent men to the Middle East without sufficient ammunition and inadequate training. Surely this country has learned from that. We could only send two ships. The choice was to send four ships straight away and have nothing to replace them with or to send two ships which could be rotated with another two for as long as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> That is exactly the situation we face with the use of infantry battalions. We must have sufficient battalions in order to sustain a force in the field. Contrary to what is widely believed, a low level contingency, which is what we are told is the most likely situation that we will have to face, is extremely labour intensive. A low level of contingency does not mean that a low level of commitment is needed. Such a commitment is heavily labour intensive, particularly in a country as vast as Australia, with so many areas that need defending in the north. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears from selective leaking by the Minister to certain journalists that we are to become more dependent upon our reserves. If that is so, how can that not be at the expense of our readiness? What effect will that have on our readiness? What saving, if any, does the Government expect to make by this action? The Auditor-General's report, which we received only a few months ago, gave an indication that the reserves option could well be a more expensive one-up to 50 per cent more expensive. From what we have been able to learn to date, the ready reserve proposal, which has been floating around Canberra over recent months, appears to entail large costs in the areas of recruitment and incentive measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Other questions need to be asked if we intend to place a higher and heavy reliance on reserves. What impact will this have on the remaining regulars if we have to provide substantial cadre forces and extra training personnel to cope with the intake of ready reserves? What effect will those considerations have on the readiness of the remaining regulars? Will we been getting rid of the limitations on our ability to call out the reserves? Surely that is a critical matter in assessing the effect on the readiness of a substantial reserve force. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also be looking to see whether there will be reductions on training, exercise time, flying hours, fuel costs et cetera. All of those things affect our readiness. We shall be waiting to see whether there will be cutbacks to planned capital expenditure. Will we be able to improve our surveillance ability, our mine countermeasures, the mobility, the night vision or the communications for our army? Once again, cutbacks in these areas would clearly mean a reduction in our capability. </PARA>
<PARA> Will we be able to maintain our commitment to the United Nations peacekeeping forces which has been such a feature of Defence Force service in recent years? The Federal Government is continually talking about the need to commit peacekeeping forces to Cambodia in due course. We have just despatched another 70 people, on humanitarian assistance grounds, to the Gulf. But we have already disbanded one engineer squadron. Will we maintain a substantial engineering capability in the future? What impact will the review have on our defence cooperation projects in our region and our ability to assist our neighbours?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition shall be awaiting the Minister's announcement with enormous interest and concern. The most important resource our Defence Force has in its arsenal is its people; and their training and retention is of paramount importance in any plan for the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that we welcome the new superannuation scheme which will go some way towards giving Defence Force personnel a better deal. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said in the House of Representatives that I would speak about the details of the scheme. I intend to do so. However, the complexity of superannuation is not something that can be easily dealt with in the confines of a speech. For that reason, I intend to cover the Bill in a less detailed manner than might otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Like other Commonwealth schemes, the MSBS will be established through a trust deed and an enabling Act managed through the Retirement Benefits Office. The MSBS meets all of the occupational superannuation standards. By all accounts, it is a good scheme on a par with the new public sector scheme. It provides for existing serving Defence Force members to transfer to MSBS, with attractive transfer rates, and it provides the option to take a lump sum or pension on retirement. The reversionary and invalidity benefits provided by the scheme are also generous and equate with the public sector scheme. The MSBS, DFRBD and the earlier Defence Force Retirement Benefits (DFRB) scheme will all run alongside each other as separate superannuation schemes. However, the DFRDB will no longer accept new members, as was the case with the DFRB when the DFRDB was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS is made up of two components: first, the superannuation benefit and, secondly, the retention benefit. The MSBS is a split benefit scheme comprising an unfunded defined employer benefit and a non-defined funded benefit incorporating a member's contributions and a 3 per cent industrial award. The member contributes a compulsory 5 per cent of salary and can voluntarily contribute up to an additional 5 per cent in increments of one per cent, so long as a period of three months elapses between varying the contribution rate. These contributions, plus the Government's 3 per cent industrial award, will be lodged with the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, as funds manager. </PARA>
<PARA> The funded member contributions may be accessed or preserved on resignation. If they are accessed, they are paid to the member as an eligible term payment and may be spent or preserved in a roll-over fund. They can also be preserved in the MSBS fund, where the value of the benefit is linked to the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust earning rate. The 3 per cent funded productivity award is preserved until age 55, as is the unfunded employer benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The employer benefit is a defined benefit based on length of service and final average salary over the three years preceding resignation. So the serving member knows now what he or she will be eligible for. For those who opt to transfer from DFRDB to MSBS, all time spent as a DFRDB member, which is since enlistment, is credited at notional value to the member's MSBS account based on the long term bond rate phased in over two years. This means that if, for example, a sergeant who has now had 12 years service decides to leave the service, he will receive approximately $11,500 DFRDB contributions-and that is all, after 12 years of service. But if the same sergeant elects to transfer from DFRDB to MSBS, his MSBS account will be credited with approximately $22,000; that is, $11,500 DFRDB contributions and $11,100 interest on those contributions over 12 years. This is the member contribution and it will increase as the sergeant continues to make contributions while he or she is in the service. At that same 12-year mark, if the sergeant is transferred to MSBS, he or she is also entitled to receive approximately $48,000 in employer benefits when he or she reaches age 55. This will also grow as the sergeant continues to be employed. </PARA>
<PARA> The 3 per cent productivity award is also part of the member contribution and grows in the same fund but, like the employer contribution, it is not available until age 55. There is a big difference between the sergeant leaving at the 12-year mark under DFRDB with a $11,500 return and under MSBS a possible $70,000 return, albeit some of it at age 55. It is therefore easy to see that it is most important for all defence personnel to make sure that they carefully weigh up their options when deciding whether to transfer. It is quite clear from the different constituents who have come to my office that the different situations of different people require very careful consideration. These people require a great deal of help in making a decision as to what is in their best interests. </PARA>
<PARA> MSBS looks good for the sergeant in our example, but it may not be if he or she plans to stay in for 20 years and take a fully indexed pension for life. Every case is different and defence personnel must make their decisions wisely. It is very important that all Defence Force members receive individual consultation and help in what is the best for them for their future regarding the transfer option. I say this because it has been brought to my attention that some defence personnel, although they claim to have had consultation, do not know about the entitlement to employer contributions if they transfer to MSBS and then leave within two years. There is a phasing-in period of two years for the member contributions but not for the employer benefits. This misunderstanding could mean the difference of many of thousands of dollars in future benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Cost estimates for the DFRDB and the MSBS have been prepared by the Australian Government Actuary in consultation with consultant actuaries. Overall, we are told that the MSBS will result in long term savings to the Government. There are costs associated with the introduction of the scheme in the short and medium terms. These result mainly from the funding of MSBS member contributions, but also from the funding of the 3 per cent productivity benefit; the provision of a retention benefit; the credit of notional interest to the DFRDB contributions of members transferring to MSBS; increased administrative costs during the initial MSBS implementation period; the change in the form of the primary superannuation benefit from a pension in the DFRDB to a predominantly lump sum in the MSBS; and the deferral of payment of the MSBS employer-financed superannuation benefit until members reach 55 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated net impact of the introduction of MSBS on annual budgetary outlays for Defence Force superannuation during the transitional period-1991-92 to 1994-95-ranges from $151m to $209m. Budgetary savings are expected to commence in about 35 years from now. The expected net annual savings will be 2.8 per cent of future salaries of new entrants to the scheme. Savings are also expected to emerge from existing DFRDB scheme members who transfer to the new scheme equivalent to $690m in net present value terms. The actuaries have forecast that the expected net long term employer costs, after tax and social security clawbacks, for current members who join the scheme will be less than the projected long term employer costs of the old scheme for these members if they remain in the DFRDB. </PARA>
<PARA> The actuaries also expect a 10 per cent increase in retention. This leads to me to the final part of my speech-that is, the retention benefit. I have saved this for last because it is interesting that the Government has had to include a retention benefit in a superannuation scheme. The retention benefit component of the scheme seems a bit out of place in the structure of most superannuation schemes, private and public. But for some time the Opposition has recognised that retention is a serious problem, and a problem that is still very real despite the fact that there has been something of a reduction because of people getting out of the Defence Force prematurely. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of our defence science and personnel policy we stated that we would provide early access for selected personnel to limited lump sum benefits by way of an advance against the final retirement benefits during the service career. It was intended to use this procedure to retain those personnel at senior non-commissioned officer and middle ranking officer level whose experience and training were particularly important to retain the 20-year mark. We recognise the retention problem caused by the Government's mismanagement. It is good to see that the Government has now finally recognised the appalling situation created during its eight years in government. The Government has seen it as a way of arresting the high wastage rate it has brought about during those years in government. That is the only reason it is needed. Twenty-six per cent of the Force has been lost over the last two years. When this Government came to office in 1983 the total strength was 71,641. December 1990 had the figure down to as low as 67,469. </PARA>
<PARA> Wastage from the defence forces is not only a capability problem, as I said earlier; it is also one of cost. The extra training costs required to train new people to replace those that leave is quite substantial. It has been estimated that it would cost about $53m to get the Army wastage alone back to where it was before the increased wastage rates occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only because the Government got the defence forces in this mess in the first place that it has needed to adopt a retention benefit. The retention benefit consists of one year's salary, taxed, and paid to the member at the 15-year service point in order to retain that member to the 20-year mark. The benefit is optional but if it is taken it contracts the serviceman for a further five years of service. If the contract is broken for other than invalidity, a clawback prevails on a pro rata basis. The tax advantages of the clawback are such that members would need to consider carefully whether they should break the contract. Assuming a member had a salary of $40,000 and elected to take the retention benefit, the after-tax payment would be in excess of $20,000. Subsequent resignation after contract commencement would lead to the respective clawback of $32,000 after one year and $16,000 after three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have several amendments to this legislation, one of which relates to the changing of the retention benefit from a lump sum retention benefit to a yearly retention benefit in order to escape a higher tax bracket. We are concerned that this may defeat the purpose of a retention benefit. Without the clawback or disincentive to not leave, the benefit may not act as a retention benefit. That is one of the reasons we will shortly move to refer this legislation to a standing committee for further investigation. The Democrats are also planning to move amendments to the Superannuation Act. I understood that my colleague Senator Short would be speaking about that aspect. I am not sure whether he will be speaking during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition is planning to refer the Bill to a committee for further scrutiny. Concerns have also been raised by the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association, which has not had an opportunity to be tested by the questioning of officials. We in the Opposition believe that it is an appropriate place to have some quite serious matters looked at in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Several months ago, before this legislation came before the House, I wrote to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) and drew his attention to the fact that this legislation would be very complex and that it would need a great deal of careful scrutiny if we were to avoid the situation which occurred with the new Commonwealth scheme, where a number of anomalies were found after the legislation was passed which may need subsequent amendment. In order to have the opportunity for close scrutiny by the Parliament, interested welfare groups and service men and women themselves, I asked the Minister whether he would be prepared to lay this legislation on the table for some months before it was taken through the Houses of the Parliament. The Minister did not see fit to take that course of action, which at the very least was a pity. Some legislation benefits greatly from having a longer time in the public arena. In that this legislation has not been given treatment, in that it is of such great importance to Defence Force personnel and in that it has a great impact on the morale of the Force and thereby to retention, we in the Opposition believe that it is appropriate that it be referred to a Senate standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw your attention, Mr Deputy President, to the fact that the amendments which are being proposed by the Australian Democrats raise matters that require detailed assessment in financial terms-for example, their effect on budgetary and taxation matters. It is for those reasons that we in the Opposition believe that the appropriate committee would be the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In that way people with expertise in tax and public finance will have the opportunity to give the legislation the sort of scrutiny that it requires. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has some view that it would more appropriately go to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Although this is a Bill relating to the defence portfolio, the matters which require further scrutiny at the committee stage are not truly matters directly relating to defence. They relate much more to finance and taxation. Therefore, I foreshadow that I will move a motion to that effect after the conclusion of the second reading debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now debating two very significant Bills on superannuation as it affects members of the armed services or those who have served. The Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 is being debated together with the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made the point yesterday in an urgency motion that hope springs eternal. Ordinary Australians place hope in their governments to provide them with essentially two very important things. One is an assurance of an income now and the other is an assurance of an income in the future. Superannuation is extremely important to us all. Those who serve in our armed services and have done so have been, I believe, particularly vulnerable in this respect. They have been dependent upon those outside the service to get it right for them in matters of superannuation. However, the fact is that over the years those entrusted with that function have got it wrong. With regard to superannuation provisions, those who have served in our armed services have been hard done by in the past. A series of schemes that have served this requirement for them have not served them well. These Bills address some of the inadequacies in that and therefore they are to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> In broad terms, the Australian Democrats will support the thrust of the Bills, although we will be attempting to improve them by amendment in the committee stage of the debate. As Senator Newman has pointed out, that is probably most appropriately done in a slower time in the context of a standing committee where witnesses can come forward and more intensively analyse what the Government and the Parliament is proposing on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians used to be great savers, but with the scourge of inflation the habit of saving has long since died. The provision that we make for our income in our middle to latter years is now normally done through superannuation schemes. The ethos of the service, as I say, is a very special one. It has been in a non-unionised context and therefore it has been a very rare thing in mess halls and officers' and sergeants' messes to hear issues of superannuation and pay, et cetera, discussed by those who have been serving. </PARA>
<PARA> From my 10 years in the Australian Regular Army, I virtually recall no occasion when such issues were seriously discussed. We assumed that somebody was looking after those things for us. When I chose to come out of the Regular Army after 10 years of service, I got a surprise at what was not awaiting me at the end of that period. The message was driven home to me quite forcibly that those who had been attending to my needs in this respect had not served me well. Those in the services now would certainly welcome the fact that these processes are being reviewed. There is a very genuine attempt being made in these Bills to improve them. I acknowledge, as Senator Newman has rightly pointed out, the changing structure and changing motivations of those who served. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the Force review structures which are occurring now, Australia is at an absolute watershed-a critical stage. The deliberations and decisions of government will be put before the Australian public before they are put before the Parliament. We will all hear on 6 June what the future of our Defence Force is. We in the Democrats have made no secret of the fact that we believe it is an opportune matter for profound lateral thinking about how our defence forces are structured and the seeking of alternate models. We have attempted and quite deliberately been provocative in that respect because we believe that it is time to be provocative and lateral and to acknowledge that we are in many respects fortunate now to be able to do a rethink and a review.</PARA>
<PARA> In that respect we welcome the innovative thoughts of Mr Wrigley. I do not deny that what he has proposed is quite controversial or that his report was regarded, initially at least, quite negatively by those in the services. I remember as a member of the defence subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade being on the road travelling through units in Queensland on the first two or three days the Wrigley report hit the deck, when we witnessed and heard the initial reactions. Wrigley was provocative. He said, `Let us at least be prepared to think in quite dramatic and lateral terms about the way in which we structure, fund and generally administer our defence services'. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very important times. There is no doubt that the morale in the services must inevitably be in shock. It behoves us to take very gravely the responsibilities that we carry for the people who put aside the privilege of fighting their own cause and their own battle in these respects and pass that responsibility across to us. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills, therefore, are of extreme importance to those who are serving and to those who have served. In commenting on the first of the Bills, the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, in broad terms, the Government is amending the Defence Force retirement benefits (DFRB) and the Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) schemes to generally improve some minor aspects of benefits payable and to simplify some administrative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 come under a number of headings. First are those that propose alteration to the Constitution and manner of appointment to the Authority which administers the scheme. Not surprisingly, in the past, appointments to the Defence Force Retirements and Death Benefits Authority have been made by the Governor-General. In future they will, as a result of the passage of this Bill, be made by the Minister. Terminations will be made by and resignations made to the Minister instead of the Governor-General. The meeting rules of the Authority will also be slightly amended. </PARA>
<PARA> The second general area of amendment is the compulsory cessation of contributions after 40 years of service. There has been an anomaly whereby people who have served for 40 years have been obliged to continue to contribute with no effect to the scheme. It is appropriate that that anomaly is addressed. Thirdly, the Bill enhances the classification and reclassification powers to be granted to the Authority in respect of invalidity benefits where circumstances change when the pensioner has died. In other words, what used to happen is that, upon the death of a pensioner, everything was locked in. The provisions associated with the pension entitlement were put into concrete and were not able to be changed in accordance with the general change in circumstances of others within the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area is improvements to benefits paid to surviving spouses. A surviving spouse will be entitled to payments for six full fortnights at the deceased pensioner's full rate immediately after the death of the pensioner. In addition, the administrative arrangements for recovering the amounts paid in the name of the deceased and then making a subsequent payment to the spouses will be effected by offsetting the amount within the Authority. This should help to lessen confusion which is often experienced by elderly grieving spouses. It was a very inappropriate and unsatisfactory arrangement. All of this coincides with recent improvements to the age pension and to the superannuation benefits payable to Commonwealth public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional payments will also be available under the DFRB scheme. This highlights an anomaly which has been brought to the attention of my colleague Senator Meg Lees that special payments are not available under the old 1922 Commonwealth superannuation scheme. The Government will not reconsider this issue, according to our discussion with the Department of Finance representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of extending the bereavement benefit to those covered by the 1922 superannuation scheme is approximately $200,000 per annum and most would acknowledge that that is not a substantial sum of money in the general context of superannuation schemes. This legislation provides an appropriate vehicle for us to address that anomaly in an amendment and we will attempt to do so in the committee stage of this Bill. The fifth area of change in the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill concerns the nature of the benefits payable to members who retire from the scheme for a second time. I will not go into the details of all of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of consequential amendments which arise from these provisions I have outlined and they affect the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948 and the Defence (Parliamentary Candidates) Act 1969. Those consequential amendments are provided for in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Australian Democrats welcome this Bill. We do not see it as being necessarily perfect, nor necessarily in the final form in which it should be addressed by this chamber. However, it comes to grips with a series of serious anomalies, and we believe the referral of the Bill to a committee-as suggested by Senator Newman, the committee where the greatest expertise lies rather than to a committee where the lesser expertise lies-will provide an opportunity for both those who are in service and those in past service to come forward to address the provisions of the Bill and perhaps to espouse further amendment following their representations at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill is the Military Superannuation Benefits Bill 1991. Honourable senators will recall that the Government announced in the Budget last year that a new superannuation scheme would be established from 1 October 1991 for regular Defence Force personnel. The proposal stems from a report on the existing scheme-the DFRDB scheme-by the review committee, which was chaired by Sir William Cole. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed scheme will be called the military superannuation benefits scheme (MSBS). Persons joining the regular Defence Force on or after 1 October 1991 will automatically join the MSBS. Those who are presently serving will have to make a choice between two options. Membership of the MSBS will also be available to reservists who render continuous full time service for a period of or exceeding three months. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be a challenge for this Bill to accommodate any major restructure to the Reserve which could be announced or proposed as a result of the ministerial announcement on 6 June. But the nature of legislation is that it accommodates what is now and what is passed rather than what is likely to be and the unforeseen, even though that may only be about three or four weeks away. It may well give rise to a situation where the concepts which are inherent in these two Bills may possibly be rendered inappropriate by changes which are simply three or four weeks away in concept but may be further away in reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The MSBS will comply with the provisions of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. In that respect, it is a very positive move. There is uniformity and, slowly but surely, superannuation provisions are being brought to common standards. The common standards proposed within the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 are now complied with by the superannuation provisions proposed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the main features of the new scheme? First, the MSBS will establish a separate fund. That is significant in that in the past the DFRDB and the DFRB schemes were not separate funds and the money went into Consolidated Revenue. Those who were administering the funds went to the Treasury and sought back the necessary funds in annual allotments, allocations, of funds; in other words, subject to the whims of Budgets as opposed to the contributions going directly into a fund which was administered by the Authority itself. There will be a degree of autonomy available and a degree of detachment from Budget considerations which did not prevail previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The second significant feature of the Bill is that member contributions and the Commonwealth's 3 per cent award contribution will also be paid into the MSBS. Contribution rates will be variable at the option of the member in the range of 5 to 10 per cent of salary. Therefore, individuals are able to plan to accommodate their own specific needs. </PARA>

The debate was adjourned to enable us to inspect the documents, there being a concern about aspects of those documents being commercial-in-confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have inspected the documents and the departmental officers have pointed out to us the figures and the paragraphs in the documents which they consider to be commercial-in-confidence. We understand that the officers have provided the Minister with a copy of the documents with those particular paragraphs blacked out. We have no quarrel with that assessment. As I said this morning, we would not wish to have tabled in the chamber anything that might be embarrassing commercially to a third party. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents in question include a reconsideration of the matter by a person described as `the manager'; the document which is being referred to as the leaked document, which is the reassessment of the issues, after receipt of the letter from Senator Bolkus; the letter from Senator Bolkus asking that certain action be taken; the independent group's reassessment of the matter; and a legal opinion, which we accept as a whole as being commercial-in-confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, as the only objection to tabling which the Minister has put to the chamber today has been that aspects of the document are commercial-in-confidence, presuming he supports his officers' assessment-a senior officer of his department and a senior officer of the Prime Minister's Department-as to which parts of the document are properly so described, we might be able to conclude the matter if the Minister agrees to table the balance of those documents. This matter would then require no further debate today. The Senate having given me leave, I simply put that in an effort to expedite further consideration of this matter today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was reviewing the changes to military superannuation which flow from the Military Superannuation and Benefits Bill 1991 which we are debating cognately with the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. In general terms, I had been saying that the Australian Democrats welcome the changes that are inherent in these Bills and that there is a great degree of dependence on the part of service people on the Parliament and the ministry and those responsible to attend to needs of superannuation on their behalf. Essentially they are a non-unionised group of people who have great dependence on others to service their needs in this respect. I was reviewing the changes to the provisions resulting from this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third feature of the new scheme that is proposed-which is known as the military superannuation benefits scheme (MSBS)-is that contribution rates will be variable at the option of the member, ranging from 5 to 10 per cent. This is similar to the arrangements for normal public servants, except that the contribution for public servants may vary between 2 and 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme is much fairer for members who retire after less than 20 years of service, as they currently receive no interest on their contributions. That is significant because at the moment people can serve up to 17 years and all they get is a refund of their contributions. As I said, after 10 years of service myself, I must admit that that came as a shock. Therefore, this is an extremely welcome aspect of this new Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Benefits will be more varied, with members having the option of taking a lump sum, a generous annuity by commercial standards, or a combination of the two. Generally the employer benefit, including the 3 per cent award contribution, must be preserved-that is, it cannot be accessed until age 55. The scheme provides comprehensive invalidity benefits, which are to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> Reversionary benefits will be payable on all benefits to a spouse or a dependent child or to the will beneficiary or a personal representative. A member will be entitled to appeal against any decision of the board of trustees or any of its delegates, and that right of appeal is a new provision in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated previously, a pension for life has been a strong incentive to complete 20 years of service before retirement. Since this will not be available under the MSBS and the benefit payable for less than 20 years service performed will be substantially improved relative to the DFRB scheme, the problem of retaining valued staff may arise. Senator Newman rightly cited the fact that people were tending to leave the services earlier than previously. To counter this, the Bill proposes a special payment called a retention benefit, which will be paid where members meet five essential criteria. We regard that as being a significant acknowledgment that there is a tendency for all sorts of reasons for people to leave before they have completed 20 years service. The wastage of expertise is very expensive and is dislocating as far as the services are concerned in many respects. So we regard this retention benefit payment as a very important innovation. </PARA>
<PARA> We also foreshadow an amendment during the Committee stage whereby a member who chooses to opt out after having qualified for this retention benefit could choose to receive the benefit either in a lump sum or five incremental payments. It is inappropriate that somebody be forced to take it in a lump sum and therefore bear the maximum tax impact upon that sum. We do not accept Senator Newman's observations that to stage it in five increments may detract from the effectiveness of the benefit payment. It has certain advantages in terms of recovery should somebody default on the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> If somebody qualifies and opts to take this retention benefit, for example, at a 15-year service point-five years before the intended time of departure, namely, 20 years of service-there is a requirement for the authority to go through the process of recovery of what could be a quite substantial sum of money, which may impact very disadvantageously upon the person who chose, for what could be very good reasons, to go out at a 15-year point and to live with the recovery consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> An incremental provision, which somebody can opt for, has the benefit of considerably reducing those recovery requirements. Under this proposal the maximum benefit is equal to one year's salary. That is an extremely attractive incentive, and the Government is to be commended for building into this scheme the degree of flexibility that is inherent in that provision to opt for a lump sum of one year's salary after 15 years service. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the realities of how that would affect, for example, the average serviceman enlisting at the age of 18 to 20 years and having that option available at 35 years of age; it is quite likely that that serviceperson would possibly have teenage children and it would be a period of life when it would be very attractive indeed to take a benefit of the equivalent of one year's salary. It becomes less attractive if the tax man gets 36 per cent or more of it. Therefore, in this incremental provision we propose that the tax impact be reduced and the attractiveness of the proposition increased. I foreshadow that we will move such an amendment during the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats congratulate the Government on coming to grips with a series of anomalies and inadequacies associated with the Defence Force superannuation. We believe that both of these Bills are constructive and necessary and, in broad terms, we support them. We foreshadow the two amendments I have mentioned. We believe that it is appropriate that the Bills be approached in the Committee stages in slower time rather than quicker time. We also believe it is appropriate, as Senator Newman foreshadowed, that the Bills be referred to the committee which has the maximum expertise on superannuation and, therefore, we will support that reference proposition when Senator Newman moves it shortly. </PARA>

It must be remembered that this scheme starts in October 1991, that people are given the option of a year in which to consider which of the two schemes they may go into, and that we will spend something like $4m on the educative process to really get out to all the armed services exactly what we mean by this. Senator Newman is right when she says it is complex and it will take a lot of thinking by some people as to which way they will go. We will endeavour as much as possible to assist that process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The production of the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill will help. Senator Newman used the classic Opposition ploy approach that almost every Bill should lie on the table of the House and be left to hang around for many months. We are used to that. If Senator Newman ever gets into government, she we will do exactly what we have done and we will probably complain and say, `You should have laid the Bills on the table for ages and ages'. It is not a perfect world and it is not always easy to do that particular thing under pressure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened to Senator McLean tell me when I will be delivering my parliamentary statement on defence. It is amazing that when it is said, `It could be on 6 June' everyone automatically accepts 6 June. It could be 4 June. I am not sure yet. It will be in that vicinity but nobody should automatically assume that the force structure review, the response to Wrigley and the comments on ready reserve will be on 6 June. It is in that era. But like all things in defence, rumours become fact in a minute and that is one rumour that has become a fact. It may be 4 June. I know Senator McLean wants to think laterally and to think in an exciting way about defence but I caution him on this point: one of the things in defence is never to adopt a high risk strategy. That is always the constraint on any Minister for Defence-he or she cannot always take the high risk strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean went on to say that these Bills were not perfect. I have yet to see a Bill go through this place that is perfect. If anomalies appear obviously we will try to address them and address them always within the constraints of overall resources. On the basic point raised by Senator McLean, I have to tell him that the committee took into account the tax effect and then worked back to one year's pay rather than the other way around. It took into account the balancing effect. I would assert that if the amendment foreshadowed by Senator McLean got up, it would no longer be a retention benefit at all. Senator McLean does not have to worry about people abrogating and not paying it back because the force already has their money in hand. It is just a matter of deducting it and giving them a cheque. It is a relatively simple process in terms of recovery of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Having covered those few points, I should like to thank both contributors this afternoon for the very positive way they approached these Bills. I look forward to coming back and passing the rest of the stages in about four weeks time. That is my best guess. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the reference of the Defence Force Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill does raise some problems. It is a defence Bill. In the normal course of events one would think it would go to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I listened to Senator Newman's arguments today that the Bill should be referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I do not have a strong feeling on that. I do not think it is a good precedent generally to shift a Bill to a different standing committee, although I understand what is involved in Senator Newman's thoughts on this because it involves a wider concept of superannuation; that is, that all the queries are more to the funding area than the specific provisions in a Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> So I will not object. I just note for the record that I do not think we should do that too often. But, if that facilitates the passage of the Bill, then let us take that particular course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991, which amends the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Marriage Act 1961 and the War Gratuity Act 1945. Part 2 of the Bill deals with the complex area of sex discrimination and the law relating to superannuation. These amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 are the most substantial in the Bill, and I will mention briefly the other parts of the Bill before returning to discuss these particular amendments in more detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill provides for amendments to the Marriage Act 1961 so that the marriageable age for both males and females is 18. The amendments also provide for the age to be reduced to 16 by way of court order. Part 4 of the Bill amends the War Gratuity Act 1945. That Act is currently discriminatory in that it provides for differing benefits to widowers and widows and does not recognise de facto spouses. The Bill removes that discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the amendments relating to sex discrimination, the position under the existing legislation-the Sex Discrimination Act 1984-is that it is unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy in the provision of goods, services and facilities, for payment or not, by refusing to provide them. It is also unlawful to discriminate in the terms or conditions under which they are provided, and in the manner in which they are provided. The legislation provides for several exemptions to acts and practices that constitute discrimination on the ground of sex or marital status. These include exemptions relating to superannuation and insurance contained in section 41. </PARA>
<PARA> When Parliament passed the Sex Discrimination Act in late 1983, the intention was that the superannuation and insurance exemptions would operate only for a two-year period. However, because of the many complex issues involved it became clear that it would be necessary to extend the exemptions. It was agreed that there should be a comprehensive inquiry into the problems raised by the life insurance and superannuation industries in the various submissions they made on the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry was undertaken by the then Human Rights Commission at the request of the Attorney-General in 1984. Its report was tabled in this place in November 1986. Various recommendations were made, the principal one being that superannuation schemes should be made to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of the sex discrimination legislation. The provision of a transition period of three years was also recommended to allow superannuation schemes time to remove discriminatory arrangements. The question of the exemption relating to insurance was dealt with by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in a later report tabled in September last year. The purpose of this Bill's amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act is to reduce the number of circumstances in which superannuation and insurance funds and policies may discriminate on the grounds of sex or marital status. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the third time that a Bill seeking to remove the exemption relating to super- perannuation has been introduced. The Sex Discrimination Bill 1989 was passed by the House of Representatives but was not transmitted to the Senate, and subsequently lapsed when the Parliament was dissolved for the 1990 election. Another Bill was introduced in September 1990 but was withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> In clause 2 of this latest version of the Bill, provision is made for a two-year period from the date on which the Act receives the royal assent before the commencement of the sections containing the exemptions relating to superannuation and insurance schemes. The Opposition notes that this falls short of the transition period of three years recommended by the Human Rights Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 of the Bill amends the Sex Discrimination Act to provide for a new subsection 14(4), which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of a person's sex or marital status in exercising a discretion conferring a superannuation benefit. Clause 8 of the Bill repeals section 41 of the Sex Discrimination Act, which is the section relating to superannuation and insurance. It is replaced with three new provisions: sections 41, 41A and 41B. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new section 41 reinserts the current exemption in regard to insurance, which is currently section 41(4) of the Act. The effect of the exemption is that, in relation to an insurance policy, a person may only discriminate on the grounds of sex where the discrimination is based on actuarial or statistical data and is reasonable having regard to that data, and the discrimination is contained in the terms of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new section 41(4) deals with new superannuation policies. Pursuant to this section, there are four situations in which discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status for the provision of superannuation benefits will not be unlawful: firstly, discrimination will not be unlawful where it is based on actuarial or statistical data and is reasonable having regard to that data. Secondly, non-payment of a dependent benefit-that is, a benefit payable on the policyholder's death to another person-to those who do not have a spouse, de facto spouse or child will not be unlawful. Thirdly, the vesting, preservation or portability provisions may result in discrimination, provided it is indirect discrimination. Fourthly, it will not be unlawful for superannuation fund conditions to include a provision that confers particular benefits, or more generous benefits, on a person who was a member of a fund before the commencement of legislation and the discrimination is in the superannuation fund conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new section 41B makes provision for existing superannuation funds to continue to operate upon certain conditions without being liable to complaints of discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status, even if they have not complied with the new provisions. This proposed section applies where a person or beneficiary was a member of an existing superannuation fund and had been given an option to obtain non-discriminatory benefits and had not exercised the option, and where the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has not issued a specific exemption under section 44 relating to that superannuation scheme. The exemption conferred by this section will not apply where the administrators of the fund require a member to exercise the option in a period of less than two months. Pursuant to the provisions of clause 9 of the Bill, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has the power to grant exemptions to existing superannuation schemes to which proposed new section 41B applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition moved three amendments during the committee stage in the House of Representatives. The first of those moved by the shadow Attorney-General was to clause 6, which amends section 14 of the Sex Discrimination Act. Although this amendment was negatived, the subsequent amendment moved by the Government adequately addressed the same issue. We will therefore not be pursuing it. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment moved by Mr Peacock related to the option to transfer to non-discriminatory benefits. This is an important issue. I foreshadow that the Opposition will be pursuing that amendment and also the amendment moved by the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, Mr Ruddock, to clause 7 dealing with the relationship between section 40 of the Sex Discrimination Act and certain provisions of the immigration legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia Ltd has made several submissions in relation to this Bill raising a number of concerns with its drafting. Some of those were addressed in amendments moved by my colleague the shadow Attorney-General in the other place, but due to the detailed and technical nature of these concerns the Opposition will be moving at the end of this second reading debate for the Bill to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This will allow the Association and other interested parties to make submissions on the desirability of further amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to make some comments about the policy issues raised by this Bill. The Opposition is supporting the Bill, because the changes introduced in relation to superannuation will improve the position of women in full time and part time employment. The Bill goes some way towards redressing the entrenched discrimination against women, which is historically a part of labour force arrangements in Australia. But it is only a small step on the way towards achieving true equality for women in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, this Bill will do nothing to improve the retirement income arrangements for those in casual or seasonal employment, and that is one of the major sources of employment for women. Another source of discrimination which the Government seems to accept as inevitable is the availability of the age pension for women at the age of 60, which has resulted in this becoming, in general, the age for retirement of women. This deprives women of potentially contributing to superannuation for a further five years, up to the age of 65, as their male colleagues can. The removal of this discrimination is a feature of the coalition's retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the further point that until recently women were discriminated against in relation to their relatively limited access to superannuation and the generally lower level of benefits to which they were entitled, even though their levels of contribution were similar to those of men. Even though these issues have now been addressed, it should not be forgotten that they still affect many thousands of women in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a simple fact that women do not participate in superannuation schemes at anything like the male rate. Sixty-three per cent of males in full time employment have superannuation, compared with 47 per cent of women. Thirty-seven per cent of women work part time, and only 19 per cent of them have superannuation. These are major issues in the area of superannuation which the Government has yet to address. An obvious issue is the question of the entitlements of women who have contributed directly or indirectly to the superannuation of their husbands but who are not covered by those superannuation arrangements. This becomes especially relevant in the event of marriage breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA> As our population ages, it is becoming more and more important that people provide for their own income in retirement through superannuation. Otherwise, we risk the burden for taxpayers of providing income support for increasing numbers of age pensioners becoming unmanageably large. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's retirement incomes policy introduces the concept of a retirement savings account. This is the flexibility to allow people, whether in full time, part time or periodic employment, to make contributions throughout their working lives. When, for example, women leave the work force for several years, their husbands may continue to make contributions on their behalf and thus obtain a tax deduction for doing so. The coalition urges the Government to adopt this policy initiative and thereby give many thousands of people, particularly women, financial independence in retirement, which they will not otherwise be able to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated, at the end of the second reading debate I will be moving that the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and that it be referred to it for consideration and report by 29 May. The Committee has been given notice of both our intention and also the witnesses that we believe can bring to the Committee's attention the necessary information so that it can deliberate properly on the matters that will be before this Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats wholeheartedly welcome the appearance of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991 finally into this chamber and devoutly wish that this particular occasion will be its final appearance. However, as Senator Hill has said, the Opposition has taken the decision to refer the Bill to a committee for further deliberation, which is a matter of regret to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the third time that a Bill for this particular purpose, namely, to reduce the exemptions for superannuation which exist under the current Sex Discrimination Act, has been introduced to the Parliament. Yet only now do we find here in the Senate a Bill before us which has passed the House of Representatives and which in the end at some time-although not until after 29 May, given Senator Hill's reference to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-will pass this place and become law. The Australian Democrats feel that the Sex Discrimination Act has always contained too many exemptions. This Bill that is now before us removes some of those exemptions, and for that reason is welcome. It has been an inexorable march since the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to remove the exemptions in that original Bill. This is part of that march, another step along the way. There have been a number of amendments since 1984, and no doubt eventually we will get to the stage where we have genuine anti-discrimination legislation on matters such as superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this Bill will not pass expeditiously is a matter of regret to us because the process has been gone through so many times. We believe, however, that the exemptions which are being removed in this Bill do not go far enough. It provides for indefinite exemptions under section 40, in part II of the Act, to a number of Commonwealth Acts. These include the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, some other tax Acts and the Social Security Act 1947. These exemptions will remain and are not dealt with here. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that an indefinite exemption is inappropriate in the case of the tax and social security departments. The Democrats will be proposing amendments which in a sense will put a sunset clause on those exemptions, suggesting a five-year exemption only. We would want, as part of our amendment, to ensure a review of the situation by the Parliament in five years time. The case for exemption for those departments would have to be argued at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's motion to send this Bill to a Committee rests largely, as I understand Senator Hill, on concerns raised by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia-an association which has been consulted extensively over the years about moves to remove the exemption with regard to superannuation and which has no basic quarrel with the Bill, but some concerns about certain aspects. As I say, it is of concern to us that this Bill should not be delayed, that it should be passed and that the exemptions which are currently in the Act should be removed. Our concerns relate to the exemptions on superannuation insurance on the grounds of sex or marital status with the exceptions to which I have referred, because of the situation in which women find themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill raised the question of the retirement pension age difference between women and men, and that is a matter that should be addressed over time, but we must address it in the context of this Bill. That context relates to the fact that although 63 per cent of men are covered by superannuation, only 47 per cent of women are so covered. With such a high proportion of women in the part time work force-amounting to a figure of 37 per cent-and with only 17 per cent of them covered by superannuation, in that context it is not possible to say that men and women approaching retirement age do so on an equal basis. Although we see ourselves as a nation with legislation relating to sex discrimination and equal opportunity, it must be said that across the entire paid work force women are still only achieving 70 per cent of the pay received by men. Even though women have had the Sex Discrimination Act in place since 1984 and a range of anti-discrimination and equal opportunity legislation at State and Federal level, they are still not achieving economic equity. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that this piece of legislation improves the position of women in the paid work force in regard to superannuation arrangements-and that extent is by no means complete-this Bill is a welcome next step. We want to ensure that at least another significant step is taken in five years time in terms of the taxation and social security departments and their superannuation arrangements which remain exempted under this legislation. The Democrats welcome the Bill and will be supporting it when eventually it comes back to this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I basically support the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991 as an important step, particularly in the area of superannuation. The coalition supports this Bill and welcomes it as overdue. However, there are some aspects and details that the Liberal-National Party coalition wishes to be expanded through the committee processes. We believe that those processes can be dealt with quite expeditiously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are three aspects to the proposed legislation. I refer to the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Marriage Act 1961, and the War Gratuity Act 1945. Part I of the Bill relates to the commencement of the various other parts of the Bill. The commencement date of part II of the Bill is two years from the date on which the Bill receives royal assent. The remainder will commence in August this year. It is part II which contains the important amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, and that is the matter to which I will address my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III of the Bill relates to the Marriage Act 1961. The intention is to create parity between the marriageable age for men and women. At present the age for a female is 16 years and for a male 18 years. The intention of the legislation is to create a common age of 18 for both sexes, with provision for reduction to 16 by court order for both male and female, as opposed to the previous age of 14 for women and 16 for men. The need for this change is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Gratuity Act 1945 relating to the payment of gratuities to members of the armed forces who served in World War II and their dependants is also to be amended to remove discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to concentrate on the Sex Discrimination Act with regard to superannuation in particular because this is an important area in which there are still some problems to address, even though in principle the amendment is supported. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 of the Bill proposes a new section 41A and 41B to replace the former blanket exemptions in section 41 which applied to superannuation. The blanket exemption to superannuation which has existed in the Sex Discrimination Act until now allowed discrimination to continue to exist by law across the board in this area. The new exemptions are more specific and should serve to remove much of the discrimination which was possible under the previous legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now briefly recap on these proposed exemptions. They include a provision in fund conditions for the use of actuarial data upon which it is reasonable to rely; the provision of lesser death and disability benefits to members who have no dependants; where discrimination arises in relation to vesting, a provision for preservation and portability of benefits; and the protection of existing expectations of members of discriminatory schemes, where these members have been offered alternative schemes which are non-discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now seven years since the concept of this legislation was initiated in the form of recommendations for change by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. We in the Federal Opposition had significant input into the initial proposals which came before the chamber, and I am pleased to see the legislation close to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> As a coalition, we highlighted the needs of part time and self-employed workers. In the committee stage we moved amendments to delete a clause to allow the provisions of the Bill to be repealed by way of regulation. We moved amendments which addressed the continuity of discrimination provisions in existing trust deeds in order to obviate the necessity of amending 120,000 deeds, at a cost of an estimated $50m to the industry. While this commonsense measure has been taken, the Bill prohibits the exercise of discretionary powers in a discriminatory way. </PARA>
<PARA> These improvements now being proposed are necessary and are indeed welcomed by the coalition, the coalition having drawn attention to this sort of approach. However, it is now the third time that the Bill has come before the Parliament in a display of the Government's characteristic procrastination and failure to meet its commitments to the electorate. The initial concept has been seven years in the pipeline. Even now, there is perhaps an element of too little, too late. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point in time, it is necessary that the amendments are passed to reinforce the important changes taking place in the industry and to prevent further delays. To this end the coalition is pleased to give its consent to the proposed legislation. However, as I mentioned, there are a number of details which we believe are best flushed out by a standing committee evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there remains some concern with regard to the lack of superannuation for part time and casual workers. A failure to address this matter will result in continuing discrimination against women by default, as three-quarters of the part time work force is female. This represents approximately two million women. </PARA>
<PARA> If the purpose of the legislation is to remove discrimination and to enable more Australians to provide adequately for their retirement, there is potential for its failure at this point. There was a step in the right direction in July last year, when it became possible for part time workers working more than 10 hours a week to take personal superannuation and to claim this as a tax deduction and also for superannuation to continue for up to two years for people outside the paid work force. It is now necessary that workers become aware of the availability of this cover and that moves be made to encourage more people to take up this option. </PARA>
<PARA> To say that it is too complicated in terms of paperwork to establish greater options of superannuation for part time workers, seasonal workers and workers doing unpaid work, and to put the matter into the too hard basket just will not do. It will not do when such a large number of Australian women have their standard of living in retirement at stake. As has been pointed out before, it is essential not only for the purpose of preventing discrimination but also for the purpose of the economic health of the nation that there should be appropriate superannuation for female workers, both part time and full time. </PARA>
<PARA> Women form the greatest proportion of the aged and receive, therefore, a greater proportion of the age pension payment nationally. This figure has been placed at 70 per cent. These proportions are set to increase, not decrease, in the future. The pay-out will increase because the average age of the population is rising. With this in mind, superannuation for part time workers becomes a matter of some importance. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless there is accelerated change in the area of superannuation for more of the work force, especially in traditional women's areas, a discriminatory effect will become increasingly conspicuous as the average living standard for women in retirement falls in comparison with that of men in retirement. This is the area where perhaps these amendments are too late because for many women this change of events is already taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the comment by the honourable member for Prospect, Mrs Crosio, in the House of Representatives. She said that the Government is extending superannuation across the labour force. However, while it is possible for the bulk of the part time work force to be without superannuation, this becomes somewhat a spurious claim. Women work patterns are notably of an interrupted nature, often by reason of raising a family and then with a return to part time work as commitments to children taper off. There is also still a problem for those in irregular part time work, such as seasonal workers. There is an even greater difficulty in the area of unpaid work, such as in the raising of a family, which is an important contribution to society. Unfortunately, these problems are yet to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> There needs to be provision for members of superannuation schemes choosing to continue their cover, perhaps by means of contributions by the continuing bread winner, whether this be a man or a woman. This need would go hand in hand with appropriate taxation concessions, whether for men or women. The existing two-year period should be extended to a realistic period which would allow a parent to choose to raise a family before returning to work. Clearly this would benefit many women, as they are largely the ones who have interrupted work patterns, including periods of unpaid work. Eventual benefits to the economy from having these people covered by superannuation would have a multiplying effect as the pension bill would be reduced and more people would have the benefit of increased security and a higher standard of living in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's policy on retirement addresses these issues with proposals, such as the retirement savings account, to cover individuals with broken work patterns. This acts as a bank account not attracting the superannuation costs, roll-over charges and approved deposit fund charges which are normally incurred. This policy gives individuals in part time employment or anyone without superannuation cover the ability to continue to make contributions throughout their working lives by way of tax deductible contributions made by themselves or their partner during periods of unpaid or part time work. I therefore support the Bill and hope that it has a speedy passage through the committee to which we hope it will be referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill and, like the previous speakers, I am very pleased to see that it has actually come into this place. Like Senator Watson, I also wish it a speedy passage. I am not quite sure of the status of the Opposition's reference to committee. I am not sure whether it will need a majority vote in this place to achieve this. I did not understand Senator Powell to make clear what the Australian Democrats might want to do on that, but I hope that, however that rides out, it does not cause a delay. Indeed, I think it is somewhat disappointing that that kind of delay, even if it be small, is envisaged by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has pointed out that this is not the first time we have seen this piece of legislation. Indeed, that point has been made by people on both sides and in both the other House and here. I thought that the amount of time available to deliberate on the proposed changes under this amendment legislation might have allowed for its conclusion in this place rather than its having to go to a committee. I guess that we will have to wait to see the outcome of all that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to support this for a number of reasons, partly because I remember the debates we had at the time of the introduction of the sex discrimination legislation and the concern a number of us on the Government side had with the allowance of the exemption for superannuation funds back in 1983-84. As I remember it-and I think Senator Hill said this in his comments in this place today-there was proposed then a two-year period before the amendments to not allow the exemptions for superannuation funds would be introduced. It is a little longer than two years. Indeed, the exemption clauses still give time to the superannuation funds to allow them to adjust and to do the necessary rearrangements of their actuarial equations and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> I think what is clear with this legislation today is the message being sent to superannuation funds which is that now is the time they have to start to do that work. I presume-indeed, I hope-that some of them have done some of that work to this point, but it is no longer possible to say that there is an exemption. From now on, superannuation funds have to address that and make sure that those prospects for discrimination against women in this area are no longer allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted, too, because I think this legislation fits in very well with the other areas of policy for women introduced by the Government. These areas include encouragement to work and increased job opportunities enjoyed by women. Women in employment have been assisted in terms of necessary child-care, tertiary education training of all sorts and a number of other programs that have been spelt out in this place by Government senators. They have elaborated the Government's commitment to the right of women to look for income security during their working life and to be able to provide for some sort of financial security in retirement over and above the age pension. It is particularly important that this legislation is now before us. It is part of a package of legislation that this Government has introduced on behalf of women.</PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested to hear Senator Watson's comments. I think that they were very thoughtful. He acknowledged-it seems that his colleagues do not want to-the right of women to be in the work force, to make choices and to expect to enjoy the economic benefits of that work force participation, including the opportunity to contribute to a superannuation scheme. I sincerely hope that I do not have to use Senator Watson's remarks to remind his colleagues that they sometimes need to adjust their thinking. But I think Senator Watson's comments are appropriate. I think they acknowledge, first, the reality that there are so many women in the work force and, secondly, that it is not unreasonable for them to be making those sorts of choices. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenges that still face us in dealing with opportunities for women, even in respect of superannuation, cannot be overlooked. Some of them have been spelt out by previous speakers today. I am concerned about the small number of women to this point who are taking up their superannuation opportunities. I believe that we still have to press, educate and encourage women to see the value of appreciating the benefits of superannuation. We simply need to inform them of their rights. That is probably the main reason women are not participating. The problem is not so much one of women making a choice about what they do with the income they earn. </PARA>
<PARA> My other major concern is that women's salaries and wages are very much behind men's salaries and wages. The contributions they make and the tax concessions they enjoy are, as a consequence, lower. That, of course, is always going to be the case for people-men or women-in lower income brackets. But it is a matter of concern that the very large majority of women are in those lower paid situations. This is another area of concern for those of us who are looking at ways in which women can be assisted to enable them to gain financial security in their working life and in retirement. That is something that has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that equal pay is on the agenda again. I believe the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission has been receiving submissions on the question of equal pay. I will be interested to see whether that debate will lead to any initiatives being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of people have referred to the challenge that women face as a result of being expected to retire at the age of 50 when they become eligible for the age pension. Some curious discussions have taken place in this chamber and in other forums about women being the subject of favourable discrimination as a result of being able to enjoy early retirement. I was interested to read the speech that Mr Connolly made in the other place in April this year. He took us through some of the history of why women have had to, or have been expected to, retire early. I will not run through all of that now but I would suggest that if people are interested in yet another fascinating piece of history, they take up Mr Connolly's contribution in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments for why women should retire early ranged from what was morally good for women, usually determined by men, to the injustice of women being able to retire early and the discrimination in their favour. If ever there were a time when women should be allowed to speak for themselves, it should be on the question of when women retire and are eligible for benefits. I heard former senator Janine Haines speaking about the right for women to enjoy benefits at the age of 50. She saw it as a matter of equity and justice that women, who have been denied benefits during their working life, should be eligible for pension at that earlier age. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that a Senate standing committee examined the issue of retirement income. Whenever the question was raised of removing the discrimination between men and women in respect of the age at which they were eligible for pensions, I rarely heard it argued that men should be eligible to receive benefits at an early age. Indeed, I often heard it argued that men should be eligible only after they had reached the age of 65. I think to a large extent Government outlays were driving that argument; but there were other arguments which I will not take the Senate through. I am sure that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would know them all. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other points raised by Senator Watson-this very important concern has been raised by others-is the question of the ageing of the population of Australia and what the consequence would be if all aged persons' income were dependent entirely on the age pension. The expenditure outlays, of course, would be very large and would be expected to increase dramatically. So it is very responsible of governments to be encouraging people to take up superannuation now. People should have the ability to provide entirely for themselves financially in retirement or supplement their pensions. In this way, the contribution to aged people which will have to be made from public sector outlays will be spread. The demographic figures suggest that by 2021 we will have to face the great concern about this increased outlay to an ageing population. However, some people are suggesting that it will cut in earlier than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though I have voiced some concern about the rate of take-up for superannuation, the figures are encouraging. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released on 13 August 1990 indicate that superannuation coverage for Australian workers had dramatically increased in 1988-89. The proportion of employees covered by superannuation rose to 54.6 per cent in that period compared with 44 per cent in 1987-88. Public sector employees had a much higher coverage of superannuation, with something like 90.4 per cent covered in 1988-89. This was an increase from 68 per cent in 1987-88. In the private sector, the total proportion of coverage had increased to 40.6 per cent in 1988-89 from 44.1 per cent in the previous financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern that despite these increases in the numbers covered, nothing like 100 per cent of people eligible for superannuation are actually taking up that entitlement. Indeed, the figures might suggest that about only 75 per cent of people eligible actually have superannuation coverage. I think some of the reasons for that have been spelt out by other speakers. Certainly, Senator Watson canvassed a number of those concerns. I do not mind saying again on the record that the pattern of women's work is one reason that women may not be able to participate in continuous superannuation. They are not encouraged to participate because of the view that they might rapidly have to withdraw from the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government for the changes that it made last year to allow women to be absent from the work force for up to two years and still participate in superannuation, provided that contributions continued. This allows for continuity of superannuation. It is true that the pattern is that women make up a high proportion of the part time work force. Their irregular participation in the part time and full time work force is still the main reason that they are still not sufficiently represented within superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The encouragement that will follow from the exemption under this legislation should not be understated. It will allow the promotion of superannuation. It will target particularly those women, and perhaps men, who have not taken up superannuation. It will also serve as an initiative for the large funds to, first, appreciate the requirements when doing their own work and, secondly, contribute to the requirement for providing the community with the information it needs to have about superannuation opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a concern-I believe that it has been said in other places and it is covered; maybe the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) will be able to advise me of this-about actuarial sums being done simply on figures and thus disadvantaging women because of early retirement in terms of the charge that they might have to bear for their superannuation. As women are expected to live longer and as they may take up their superannuation earlier, there is the prospect that we will not eliminate the discrimination that we were asking for. I would like clarification on that. I hope the Minister can provide it. That is a measure of my insufficiency here; not the Government's. I would appreciate it if that were covered. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is part of a package of policies and legislation for women introduced by the Government. It is a very important one. The highest priority of women who talk to me and other government senators is income security. They want that income security not only during their working lives-whether they are in the paid work force or not-but also during their retirement. The anxiety of aged people when they are not sure of the sufficiency of their finances is known to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be very pleased if this superannuation exemption allowed for that kind of understanding so that women who have the opportunity of superannuation can now look forward to continuous income security. This allows for better planning and a better arrangement of their finances. It allows them to exercise more opportunity during their working and retirement life. It allows them a number of other advantages often overlooked. The knowledge of regular income does away with anxiety and concern about where the money is coming from and the pressure to save for the day when something will go wrong. It allows for a planned living. In particular, it allows women to exercise options throughout their lives, options which have not been available in the past and sometimes not available to them when they were thinking about their own prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important Bill. It goes to the rights of women. It appreciates and understands that they have rights. It is a matter of much more importance than just the specifics written in this legislation. It goes to changing the climate for women in society. It is part of the Government's view on the rights and role of women. In particular, it will contribute to women seeing themselves differently and exercising their options. I commend this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to support the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991. It provides me with an opportunity to reflect on the program of reform undertaken by the Hawke Government over eight years to ensure that Australian women receive a fair go. In particular, this Bill addresses a major inequity relating to women's access to superannuation. No doubt, many honourable senators will remember the celebrations on International Women's Day in 1984 when women gathered on the lawn outside the old Parliament House to mark the passage of the sex discrimination legislation through the House of Representatives. Honourable senators may remember that at that time there were ominous warnings about that legislation. It was said that it would be destructive to Australian society and to the Australian family. However, seven years on, the Sex Discrimination Act is accepted as providing genuine protection of women's rights. It is also regarded as a landmark reform responsible for heralding much more in the way of progress to ensure that women receive greater recognition across all areas of government administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I focus on the positive aspects of this Bill. It is interesting to think that it has taken us until 1991 to acknowledge that superannuation is not a luxury, but a necessity towards ensuring secure old age. It should be available to all workers, men and women. Everyone has the right to access schemes designed to provide income security in old age, and women should not be hindered in this by being penalised because of their work force participation. They usually have to combine their work force participation with a range of family commitments. They should not be discriminated against because of this other great service they give to the Australian community through their contribution to families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill particularly addresses the area of part time and casual employment. As we know, the great majority of part time employees are women. About 40 per cent of women work part time compared with only 6 per cent of men. Clearly, it is absolutely essential that the amendment Bill take up this issue. Women live longer, earn less and are often out of the paid work force for substantial parts of their adult lives. They are actually disadvantaged by their gender. So it is very important that this Bill address a number of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the very special reforms that followed sex discrimination legislation, affirmative action legislation, equal employment opportunity in the Public Service and a number of policy initiatives across government portfolios was, of course, the bringing together of all these areas into what is known as the National Agenda for Women. As I have said on many occasions in this and other places, the National Agenda for Women is important not just because it is a government initiative but also because it is a commitment of Australia to maintain that national agenda well into the future to ensure that women get considerable recognition for the implementation of those policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The national agenda has noted that less than half of Australia's employees have had superannuation coverage, with only one in four female employees being covered compared with nearly half of all male employees. The agenda objectives for the year 2000 are to assist in significantly increasing coverage and adequacy of coverage for women; to encourage and facilitate superannuation arrangements which are more responsive to the women's work force patterns; to remove discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy; and to provide, through the social security system, adequate retirement income support for those women without full superannuation support.</PARA>
<PARA> Five-year action plans aim to reduce legislative exemption of superannuation funds and schemes under the Sex Discrimination Act; to monitor implications for the national wage case decision for women, having regard to their broken work force patterns and occupational segregation; to consider superannuation alternatives in the light of women's dual role as home-makers and members of the paid work force; to introduce standards for the vesting, preservation and portability of superannuation benefits within five years which do not indirectly discriminate against women; and, furthermore, to review the report of the Law Reform Commission on matrimonial property and, if necessary, take initiatives to compensate for the loss of superannuation on divorce. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to taxation concessions, from 1 July 1990 the Government has extended the tax concessions for personal superannuation contributions for the self-employed and those with only low levels of employer provided superannuation. Under the 1989 Budget provisions for improved retirement incomes, those employed for as little as 10 hours per week are now able to contribute to personal superannuation schemes and receive a tax deduction for that contribution. Women having interrupted or part time employment will be able to retain their membership of superannuation funds by continuing contributions for up to two years while outside the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth mentioning on this occasion the new superannuation scheme that was introduced for Commonwealth employees which also became effective on 1 July 1990. That scheme overcomes the previous indirect discrimination against women which operated largely because of interrupted part time or short term periods of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not enough for government simply to pass legislation and make changes for Commonwealth employees or even to give taxation concessions unless these changes are well publicised. As my colleague Senator Crowley indicated, women in the work force and women generally can often have low self-esteem. They are not used to being recognised and given better treatment. There can be a situation where women are just not aware of their entitlements. I know this from the number of women who approach my office, and I am sure other people's offices, who are not fully informed as to their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> The better income statement which was released in 1989 highlighted the need to educate the community, and women in particular, on the benefits of saving for retirement. A community awareness campaign was implemented in February 1990 to draw attention to the award-based superannuation contribution by employers and to generate inquiry about eligibility for the practical workings of superannuation. The campaign targeted low income workers and women, with television commercials running for approximately 10 days. A booklet and telephone hot line was provided to give further information. Once this amendment Bill is passed, government needs to continue its efforts to publicise information for women in the work force, particularly in part time positions and those positions where they are more vulnerable through perhaps not being given the kind of equity that this Bill aims to give them. We need to ensure that that information is readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Crowley touched on the controversial issue of the pension age for women. In concluding I shall run through some comments about this. The lower age for pension entitlement for women compared to men has been criticised by some as discriminatory. However, it is important to make a number of points. Women have much lower labour force participation rates, superannuation coverage-as we have been discussing-and income. Raising the pension age for women may assist in altering community attitudes towards women's economic role but, unless it was raised in line with real improvements in the indicators mentioned above, women would be placed at a considerable disadvantage and in hardship. Further, a change of this sort cannot be introduced in the short term. It requires considerable community discussion and time for older women of work force age to adjust their expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's national agenda for women establishes a framework for considering a raising of the age pension age. The agenda consists of two time periods-the next five years and the period to the year 2000. Amongst other things, it sets various targets for improving superannuation coverage and benefits in employment for women. Raising the pension age can build on the same framework. At the end of the five-year period, a stocktake could be made of progress towards achieving higher superannuation coverage and better benefits for women. This would determine the need for further action. I stress that, given women's position in the work force and the fact that they are still concentrated in lower paid positions and are still dependent in so many instances on part time work, I do not think that it is an area where the Government should rush to introduce changes. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>SUPERANNUATION POLICY PROPOSAL</PARA>
<PARA>Women's Action Alliance believes that security in retirement should be available to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>As our population is ageing and our capacity to fund pensions in their present form will be limited in the future, all Australians should have access to and be encouraged to take out superannuation, regardless of whether or not they are in employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Schemes should vest funds immediately in the name of the superannuee, and funds should be preserved until retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>Single income families should be able to take out superannuation in the name of the non-earning spouse in any scheme to which the earning spouse is eligible, with all the consequent tax benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>In these circumstances, the Reasonable Benefit Limit should be based on half the final salary of the earning spouse. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, a means tested superannuation voucher scheme should be available to welfare recipients and those on low incomes to allow them to participate in any scheme to which they may be eligible. Such benefit should be in a form which could be used solely for the purposes of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>WOMEN AND SUPERANNUATION</PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation is an issue which has received increasing attention in Australia over the last few years from a wide range of interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a very valid reason for this interest. Australia's ageing population is a fact which will cause great problems for society unless solutions are found and implemented now. </PARA>
<PARA>Currently, the over sixty-five component of the population in Australia is about 10%; by the year 2020 it is expected to reach 16%. At the same time, our birth rate has declined dramatically to the extent that, were it not for immigration, Australia's population would be decreasing. </PARA>
<PARA>What does all this mean for those contemplating retirement in twenty to thirty years time? It means that, unless radical changes are made, an increasing proportion of the population will be relying on the age pension, while a declining proportion of taxpayers will be required to support them. The result? An overwhelming taxation burden on future generations of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>For these reasons, Australia needs to be looking to other methods of retirement support, the most important of which is superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>SUPERANNUATION IN AUSTRALIA TODAY</PARA>
<PARA>There are basically three different forms of superannuation in Australia today: industry funds, employer-sponsored funds and personal funds. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Industry Funds</PARA>
<PARA>This is the newest form of superannuation available in Australia. Basically, an industry fund is one which is award related and to which all workers in a particular industry are eligible. It is covered by legislation which requires certain characteristics of these funds. These include:</PARA>
<PARA>* Equal numbers of employers and employees must be represented on the board of trustees. In practice, this usually means that major employer organisations and trade unions will occupy these positions. </PARA>
<PARA>* The fund is portable. This means that, if an employee changes employment within the industry, there is no change to the superannuation. If an employee leaves the industry, the funds are normally transferred to a new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>* The funds are preserved until retirement. This means that the employee cannot have access to his/her superannuation until retirement on or after the age of 55 years. This is designed to prevent people from taking their superannuation on changing jobs and spending it before retirement. Funds can also be withdrawn in case of death, total and permanent disablement or on permanent departure to reside overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>* The funds vest immediately in the superannuant. As soon as a contribution enters the fund on behalf of the superannuant, it belongs to him/her and is held in trust until retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>* All members of an industry are eligible, whether full-time, part-time or casual employees. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Employer-sponsored Funds</PARA>
<PARA>These are funds set up by individual employers for their employees. As each fund is separate, they differ in their terms, although there are characteristics which are common to many. Originally these funds were designed to encourage employees, especially senior or management employees, to remain with their employer. Usually the company will match an employee's contribution dollar for dollar or better. There are some disadvantages in belonging to this type of scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>* The employer contributions do not vest in the employee immediately but become available under a variety of terms and conditions. A member may have to wait as long as ten years to receiver a share of employer contributions but in some cases may receive a substantial portion after one year. </PARA>
<PARA>* The contributions are usually not preserved. (except where changes have occurred since December 1986) The employee receives his/her entitlement on leaving the company. </PARA>
<PARA>* The funds in the past have not been portable but this is now changing in line with industry development. </PARA>
<PARA>* Eligibility may be limited. In most, casual and part-time employees are not eligible and many are restricted to management employees. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Personal Superannuation</PARA>
<PARA>These are private schemes taken out with an insurance company by selfemployed persons or those employees who do not have access to, or who do not wish to participate in another scheme. They require the individual to make contributions which are invested on their behalf. As there is no employer contribution as in the first two types of superannuation, the government provides a tax concession to those who take out personal superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1st July, 1988, the first $3000 per annum contributed is tax deductible plus anything above that up to the level required to fund the R.B.L. (Reasonable Benefit Level-see below). </PARA>
<PARA>OTHER REGULATIONS GOVERNING SUPERANNUATION</PARA>
<PARA>There are two other regulations governing superannuation which are relevant for our purposes, both of which relate to the final lump sum payment. </PARA>
<PARA>* From 1st July, 1990, the first $68,628 of a lump sum payment, taken on retirement is tax free with the remainder taxed at the rate of 15%. </PARA>
<PARA>* The maximum payment which can be received from 1st July 1990 is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> - where final salary is $35,000 or less, seven times final salary</PARA>
<PARA> - where final salary is $35001-$65,000, five times final salary</PARA>
<PARA> - where final salary exceeds $65,000, three times final salary</PARA>
<PARA>These figures are indexed. </PARA>
<PARA>WOMEN, SUPERANNUATION AND PAID EMPLOYMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation entitlements have traditionally not favoured women in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA>* Only one in four women have employer sponsored superannuation, compared with one in two men. </PARA>
<PARA>* For many years superannuation schemes often did not exist in occupations and industries where most of the employees were women. </PARA>
<PARA>* Women are more likely to be employed in part-time or casual work and are less likely to hold management positions. They are therefore excluded from many schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>* Superannuation schemes have not, in the past, taken account of the different employment patterns of men and women. A scheme which requires ten to fifteen years before any employer benefit is received was often unattractive to women who tend to spend periods of time out of the paid workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>IS SUPERANNUATION RELEVANT TO WOMEN?</PARA>
<PARA>Women have often ignored superannuation either because it does not adequately cater to their needs, or because they intend to rely on their husband's superannuation. However, women need to seriously consider superannuation for two reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, women cannot assume that they will be supported by their husbands in retirement, with one in three marriages ending in divorce. The Family Court's attitude to superannuation is somewhat ambiguous. Although the court usually regards accumulated superannuation funds as joint assets, there is certainly no requirement to take retirement benefits into account in any property settlement. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, women tend to outlive men, and the majority end their lives living alone. If they rely solely on the age pension they will be living below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA>WOMEN AT HOME</PARA>
<PARA>Currently, women at home are not able to cover themselves for superannuation, yet for the reasons already indicated it is as important for them as for women in paid employment. The assumptions seems to be that these women will either rely on their husbands or will receive the age pension in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>This is unacceptable on two grounds. It ignores the fact that women at home are employed: and the current regulations discriminate against the single income family, making it even more difficult for them. </PARA>
<PARA>(a) WOMEN AT HOME ARE EMPLOYED</PARA>
<PARA>Leaving women at home in ` `no-woman's land'' with respect to superannuation ignores the fact that they are employed, although unpaid. They perform work which is of measurable economic value to society as a whole. If superannuation continues to be unavailable to them, while it becomes increasingly common for those in the paid workforce, women who work at home will become the new age of social welfare dependants, a burden to society, their years of unpaid service forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA>Some method of providing superannuation for these women must, therefore, be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SINGLE INCOME FAMILIES</PARA>
<PARA>Leaving a woman reliant on her husband's superannuation places a great drain on the family income, as the level of superannuation needs to be sufficient to provide for both spouses in retirement. In this regard the current regulations discriminate against the single income family in three ways. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) Contributions: In a dual income family both spouses have access to superannuation, which means that either both receive the benefit of employer contributions, or each can claim a $3000 plus tax deduction for contributions to a personal fund. In a single income family there is access to only one employer or industry scheme (through the paid spouse) or one $3000 tax deduction where the paid spouse is in a personal scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Reasonable Benefit Limit: Because the multiple for the reasonable benefit limit decreases as the final salary increases, the single income family suffers considerably. </PARA>

<PARA>This example shows how, where the total family income is the same, the benefit level of a single income family is substantially lower than where both spouses are in paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) TAXATION OF THE LUMP SUM: As the lump sum is tax free on the first $68,628 once again the dual income family, with two superannuation schemes will have the first $137,256 tax free, while the single income family will be limited to one tax free threshold. This means that, even where the actual payouts are the same, the two income family will be $8628.00 better off. </PARA>
<PARA>SOLUTION</PARA>
<PARA>There is a way to eliminate both the problem of discrimination against the single income family and the lack of recognition of women at home. </PARA>
<PARA>The basic requirement is an amendment to the structure of superannuation to allow it to be taken out on behalf of those not in the paid workforce. This would be complemented by a provision in both industry and employer sponsored schemes which would allow an employee to contribute to the scheme on behalf of his/her spouse. In the industry funds this could be required by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>While there is no way to enforce such a provision in employer sponsored funds, such funds should be encouraged to allow contributors the same option, perhaps through some tax incentive. Personal schemes should be available to those not in paid work, increasing the tax deduction for a single income family to a possible $6000. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a system would have a number of advantages. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, it gives the single income family the ability to eliminate the taxation discrimination, as two superannuation schemes would be entitled to two tax free thresholds. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, it would ensure some provision for the wife should the marriage break down at a later date. While the husband may discontinue payments after a marriage break up, the money already in her account would be preserved for her until retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the reasonable benefit limit, where the couple have taken advantage of the availability to contribute to two superannuation schemes, the R.B.L. should be calculated on the basis of half the final salary of the paid spouse. </PARA>
<PARA>To demonstrate how this proposal would work, let us look again at Couple A. If we assume that Mr A. has contributed 5% of his salary to an industry or employer sponsored scheme for forty years, with his employer also contributing 5%, how would the proposed system affect Mr and Mrs A?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr A. would have the option of putting half the contributions (i.e. 2.5%) in Mrs A.'s name, with half the employer's contribution also being on behalf of Mrs A. </PARA>
<PARA>This would mean that on retirement, the R.B.L. would be 7 x $35,000 x 2 $490,000. They would also receive the benefit of a total of $137,256 tax free.</PARA>
<PARA>Alternatively, Mr and Mrs A. may decide to take out a personal policy on behalf of Mrs A, which would give the same advantages as above. While they would not receive the employer contribution on behalf of Mrs A. they would be entitled to a maximum deduction for contributions of $3000 (plus). If Mr A. had instead been contributing to a person scheme 10% of his salary for the same period, he would be able to divide this into two scheme on behalf of himself and Mrs A, each based on a 5% contribution. Alternatively they may decide to take advantage of the increased tax deductions and R.B.L. by increasing their contribution levels. </PARA>
<PARA>As is obvious, this system offers considerable flexibility to the family, and encourages couples to take out superannuation for both partners. </PARA>
<PARA>SOLE PARENTS AND THOSE ON LOW INCOMES</PARA>
<PARA>So far, nothing suggested would improve the position of sole parents and those for whom superannuation is an unaffordable luxury because their incomes are so low. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an argument that these people should be left to receive the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA>However, there is an alternative which would provide some dignity for those in this position, and give them the option of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>A means tested voucher system could be set up. The vouchers could be provided to all those below a set income to be invested in any superannuation scheme to which a person has access. For those in paid employment, this could mean an industry or employer scheme, or a personal fund. Those in receipt of welfare would be limited to the latter, however, as most people are not on welfare all their lives, the other options may well open up in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The voucher would need to be in a form which could only be used for superannuation, and could not be cashed in and spent. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA>Providing for our own retirement is the only way Australians are going to be able to enjoy a reasonable standard of living in the future. For this reason, all efforts should be made to ensure that superannuation is as widely and equitably available as possible to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The system proposed here, while appearing complex, is really a way of finetuning the current provisions regarding superannuation to achieve this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a little invidious of me to refer to a particular part of the document because I think that the whole of it is essential reading for both members of the Parliament and the public. I feel that it is appropriate, having regard to my introductory comments, to refer to certain aspects of the document. To place my comments into perspective, I must indicate to the Senate that the headings in the submission are: `Superannuation Policy Proposal'; `Women and Superannuation'; `Superannuation in Australia Today'; `Industry Funds'; `Employer-sponsored Funds'; `Personal Superannuation'; `Other Regulations Governing Superannuation'; `Women, Superannuation and Paid Employment'; `Is Superannuation Relevant to Women?'; `Women at Home'; `Women At Home Are Employed'; `Discrimination Against Single Income Families'; `Contributions'; `Reasonable Benefit Limits'; `Taxation of the Lump Sum'; `Solution'; `Sole Parents and Those on Low Incomes'; and `Conclusion'. I thought I should mention that to the chamber to show that this document does cover a wide range of issues that are of importance in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to focus, as I have done previously, on the issue of discrimination against the one-income family; in other words, discrimination against those mothers who are employed full time at home and who are bearing the brunt of the higher costs involved in people having to pay for superannuation because there will not be a pension, to the extent that it is now paid, in 20 or 30 years time. I refer to page 4 of the document where it relates to discrimination against single income families. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Leaving a woman reliant on her husband's superannuation places a great drain on the family income as the level of superannuation needs to be sufficient to provide for both spouses in retirement. In this regard, the current regulations discriminate against the single income family in three ways. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, this is discrimination against the woman employed in the home. The document states that it is discriminatory in three ways. The first area of discrimination relates to contributions. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>In a dual income family both spouses have access to superannuation which means that either both receive the benefit of employer contributions or each can claim a $3000-plus tax deduction for contributions to a personal fund. In a single income family there is access to only one employer or industry scheme (through the paid spouse) or only one $3000 tax deduction where the paid spouse is in a personal scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The second area of discrimination is in the reasonable benefit limit. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>Because the reasonable benefit limit decreases as the final salary increases, the single income family suffers considerably. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to give an example of two couples who may be retiring in 20 years time with a salary rate at that time of, say, $70,000 per annum. In the case of the first couple, the husband's salary when retiring in 20 years time will be $70,000, the wife's salary is nil, giving a total of $70,000. The reasonable benefit limit is seven times $35,000, which is $245,000; five times $30,000 is $150,000; and three times $5,000 is $15,000. Therefore, the total of the reasonable benefit limit is $410,000 available for the first couple; that is, a single income earner. </PARA>
<PARA> For dual income earners, when the husband's salary is $45,000 and the wife's salary is $25,000-a total of $70,000-the reasonable benefit limit is $470,000, which is considerably higher than that allowable for the one income family. The example shows how, where the total family income is the same, the benefit level of a single income family is substantially lower than where both spouses are in the paid work force. The third area of discrimination against women employed in the home is the taxation of lump sums. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>As the lump sum is tax free on the first $68,628 once again the dual income family, with two superannuation schemes will have the first $137,256 tax free -</PARA>
<PARA>of course, that is on current amounts -</PARA>
<PARA>while the single income family will be limited to one tax free threshold -</PARA>
<PARA>namely, $68,628-</PARA>
<PARA>This means that, even where the actual payouts are the same, the two income family will be $8628 better off. </PARA>
<PARA>That is given the same salary and the same payments made by each family into superannuation. That is discrimination. I ask honourable senators: is that not discrimination against women who are employed in the home?</PARA>

<PARA> Finally, I repeat that I stand here in support of the measures to eliminate discrimination of women in the area of superannuation and in other areas as well. To take the glow off this debate just a fraction further, because everybody has been in agreement, I refer to the initial comments by Senator Reynolds, the previous speaker, where she indicated that persons concerned with the Sex Discrimination Bill would tend to undermine the family. She referred to those concerns rather contemptuously. </PARA>
<PARA> We have got to be discriminating about this situation and have a look at those sections of the sex discrimination legislation which may have that effect and those which are obviously beneficial. One aspect of the sex discrimination legislation has been used in an attempt to place de facto relationships on the same basis as the marriage state and that would tend to undermine the institution of the family. We should not be too ebullient in our support of this legislation; instead we should look to see what might lie behind it and what the possible consequences of it might be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on this most important Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991. The Bill seeks to achieve certain improvements in the way in which our society deals with discrimination based on sex and marital status. I believe that it does so in a way which obviously has received the support of the chamber, though with some foreshadowed amendments-further improvements, as they are seen, but I will refute that in a moment-by the Opposition and by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the purposes of the Bill are: to remove from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 the exemption for superannuation and replace it with more limited exemptions; to insert in the Sex Discrimination Act (SDA) a number of exemptions for certain Commonwealth and Territory legislation which is presently exempted by regulations; and to amend the Marriage Act 1961 and the War Gratuity Act 1945 so as to remove inconsistencies with the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I note, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you have followed the debate with great interest, and I might say that you have controlled the chamber very well. The major effect of this Bill is to remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status from superannuation practices for new schemes. Where funds are unable to comply with the new obligations under the legislation, the reasonable expectations of the members will be maintained and the discriminatory fund will be allowed to continue. However, such funds will not be entitled to admit new members. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, members of such discriminatory schemes will generally have to be given an option to obtain nondiscriminatory superannuation benefits. I am not going to rehearse the proposed continuing exemptions. Perhaps I might shortly state that they deal with the following areas: the inclusion in fund conditions of a provision which is based upon actuarial data upon which it is reasonable to rely; the current practices whereby lesser death and disability benefits are provided to members who are single, that is, members who do not have a spouse or a de facto spouse or to members who do not have a child; the possibly discriminatory effects of the current vesting, preservation and portability arrangements in fund conditions; and the protection of the existing expectations of members of discriminatory schemes. The Government believes that the amendments to be undertaken in relation to superannuation funds represent a significant reform, for all the sorts of reasons which were so eloquently espoused by my colleagues, Senator Crowley and Senator Reynolds and supported in large measure by others. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am informed that most schemes will be able to comply with the amendments with only minor adaptations to their existing conditions, the amendments will require schemes which have not yet modified their benefits to do so over the next two years or to close off their membership. I understand that the Opposition has indicated that it would like to increase the time period in which superannuation funds will have to comply with the new requirements by providing a further 12 months for the construction of a non-discriminatory option for members of existing funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has been pressing this matter, but those opposite must admit that the Government has already provided a two-year period before commencement of the superannuation amendments and that gives sufficient time for funds to comply. Certainly the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has advised that it permits funds 18 months to two years maximum to amend trust deeds to comply with new requirements. In respect of this Bill, that Commission supported the reduction of the two-year commencement provisions to one year. Mr Deputy President, you can see from that short exposition that the Government has been more generous than its statutory adviser indicated might be quite acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The superannuation industry has had ample notice of the requirement to construct a non-discriminatory option for members of discriminatory schemes. The Government's intentions to amend the superannuation provisions as provided by this Bill have been under discussion with the superannuation industry for several years. Most of the key policy issues of the legislation have not changed since the Bill was introduced into Parliament in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the amendments to be effected by this Bill concern the exemption for inconsistent Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances-I do not know whether any Senators here are members of that Committee-expressed strong concern about the possibility of any further renewals of the exemptions by regulation. Consequently, the Government, taking all that into consideration, proposes that the existing provisions of the Act concerning the power to extend exemptions by regulations be repealed. The current regulations will expire on 31 July this year. Nevertheless, the Government has decided to grant indefinite exemptions under section 40(2) of the Act to a number of Commonwealth Acts and they have been listed and are well known to senators in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Income Tax Assessment Act uses a number of terms such as `relative', `associate', and `dependant', which are discriminatory on grounds of marital status. These terms are used in various tax Acts and are aimed at preventing tax avoidance and the abuse of tax concessions and therefore the desirability of indefinitely exempting this legislation is obvious. So also it has been argued for the other statutes that are to be exempted. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major provision of this Bill is to amend those provisions of the Marriage Act which provide for the marriageable age of females. At the moment, as senators will be aware, the marriageable age for females is 16, but the marriageable age for males is 18. It is the case that the minimum age at which females and males below marriageable age can marry can be varied by obtaining court authorisation. I think it is provided that where the parties have court authorisation, a female between 14 and 16 and a male between 16 and 18 may obtain permission to marry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for a common marriageable age of 18, with the provision for a reduction to 16 in exceptional circumstances. This common marriageable age trend is a worldwide tendency. There are now at least 38 countries which prescribe a common marriageable age; 24 of these prescribe a marriageable age of 18 years. A table which was attached to the original second reading speech may be of interest to senators and to members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey of marriage counsellors, marriage educators, court counsellors and national marriage counselling representatives was conducted by the Department in 1988. Forty-seven per cent of just over 1,000 persons polled responded. Of those, 65 per cent were of the view that 18 is an appropriate minimum marriageable age for males and 63 per cent were of the view that 18 is an appropriate minimum marriageable age for females. These people who were surveyed have very real contact with those whose marriages are either aided by an education program or have suffered a breakdown, a disruption in the relationship or possibly separation and even divorce. So it is worth taking their experience and views into account. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be noted also that in 1989 there were around 117,000 marriages in Australia. Of these, only 1,052 were of females under the age of 18 years. Further, only 13 of these marriages were of females under the age of 16 years and required court authorisation. It seems that the move to a common minimum marriageable age is something which is well supported. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I understand the Opposition has foreshadowed an amendment to exempt the entire Migration Act. This clearly would be unacceptable as it would permit all forms of discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status and pregnancy in migration programs. The amendment would exempt the Migration Act as in force at any time. This would be inconsistent with the policy of exempting from the Sex Discrimination Act only inconsistent legislation as in force at the commencement of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The other indefinite exemptions provided in the Bill are limited to exempting that legislation as in force at the commencement of the Sex Discrimination Act. The amendment appears to be motivated by Opposition concerns that the requirement in the Sex Discrimination Act that persons in de facto marriages not be treated less favourably than married persons was being used to avoid immigration controls on the grant of residence permits. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerns that sham relationships are being used to gain permanent residence have arisen in the context of both married and de facto relationships. These concerns have been addressed by new immigration guidelines, which take a stricter approach to application for permanent residence on the ground of married or de facto relationships. Those guidelines provide that married applicants must produce a marriage certificate and de facto applicants must produce evidence that the de facto relationship is of at least six months duration, unless there are certain exceptional circumstances such as a substantial long term joint financial obligation, a previous marriage with the same person or a co-resident child of the relationship. Both married and de facto applicants must produce evidence of the partner's Australian citizenship or permanent resident status and two statutory declarations attesting to the genuine and continuing nature of the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> Those guidelines have been formulated to be consistent with the Sex Discrimination Act. They are also expected to be effective in reducing the potential for sham relationships to undermine residence controls. Therefore, the Government believes there is no need for the Migration Act to be exempted for this purpose from the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the foreshadowed amendments of the Australian Democrats to taxation and social security legislation, which were put forward by Senator Powell-the proposal to exempt tax laws from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act, we believe, in the form foreshadowed, could not be well supported. In late 1987 the Australian Taxation Office completed a review of laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, which identified those provisions which were discriminatory in terms of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The Government subsequently agreed to amend many of those provisions so that they complied with the SDA. Those amendments were included in the Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> It was decided that some other discriminatory provisions would not be amended largely because of the serious revenue consequences or inequities that would result. Once again, I will not go into these in detail. However, those provisions fall broadly into four categories: first, anti-avoidance provisions which are essential to the protection of the revenue; secondly, some concessional rebates-the spouse and housekeeper rebates, which the Government decided should not be replaced; thirdly, provisions giving effect to international agreements which could not be amended without placing Australia in breach of the agreements; and fourthly, provisions in the tax law, which are no longer applied but for which some assessment may still need to be issued, for example, gift duty law. Any amendments would place those persons assessed after the application date of such an amendment in a position different from those assessed before or vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA> All tax laws passed after the commencement of the Sex Discrimination Act are not subject to the Sex Discrimination Act but are drafted with a policy of the Sex Discrimination Act in mind. Accordingly, the permanent exemption for the tax laws only has effect in relation to tax laws existing prior to the commencement of the SDA. In reaching the decision to permanently exempt the tax laws listed in the Bill, the Government consulted with the sex discrimination commissioner. Having understood that this Bill will now go to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I do not think I need to go into any more detail in relation to that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the removal of exemption of the Social Security Act, which is foreshadowed by the Australian Democrats, it seems that they have not quite fully appreciated that the areas of discrimination which remain in the Social Security Act generally favour women rather than men. An amendment of the sort proposed by the Democrats could operate to the disadvantage of women and it is questionable therefore whether the amendment would achieve what the Democrats might wish. I give only two brief examples. As to family payments, the Act currently provides that a dependent child for family allowance purposes generally shall be deemed to be a dependent child of the wife and not the husband. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment would presumably require the family allowance to be made non-discriminatory and be paid either to the husband or to the wife depending on who claimed the payment or would require the family allowance to be split between the husband and the wife. Making family payments such as family allowance and family allowance supplement to wives is an attempt to ensure that assistance for children is directed to the woman who is usually the primary care giver, and we would not want this to change. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the age pension it is paid to women aged 60 years and over and to men aged 65 years and over, subject to income and assets tests. The amendment would require that the age pension be non-discriminatory by either lowering the age pension for men to 60 or raising it for women to 65. With an ageing population the costs of lowering the eligible age for men would preclude that option. </PARA>
<PARA> In the August 1989 statement on retirement income policy, the Government stated it would monitor the progress of women's participation in superannuation and the labour force before considering an increase in their pension age. Recent labour force surveys by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) indicate that only about one-third of women aged 55 to 59 years are in the labour force and almost half of these work part time. In addition about two-thirds of women in the age bracket prior to the current age pension age rely on income from sources other than work. </PARA>
<PARA> An increase in the age pension age for women to 65 years would simply force most affected women to seek other forms of income support such as unemployment benefits. It would also prevent many women retiring at the same time as their husband. There is also concern for the adequacy of women's retirement incomes. The ABS superannuation survey of 1988 estimated that only 37 per cent of women and 19 per cent of part time workers were covered by superannuation. With the advent of award superannuation these percentages will increase but it is still the case that women currently nearing retirement age have less capacity than similarly aged men to provide for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of this, now is not the right time to consider an increase in the female age pension age. Only in a few years when improved vesting and preservation standards apply, and labour force participation rates for older women have improved, should the issue be open for serious consideration. However, any increase in the pensionable age for women will need to be phased from a date well in the future in order to give adequate forewarning to those affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadowed in some detail some of the answers to matters which have been put forward by the Opposition and the Democrats to be considered in more detail no doubt at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the matters raised by Senator Crowley, I will also be able in that forum to provide a fuller answer. In relation to Senator Harradine's comments, no doubt the particular document to which he gave so much weight is worthy of consideration. Whilst I do not think it affects the full drafting of this particular Bill, nevertheless it is well worth reflection. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

This amendment will make it clear that the term `presidential member of the Commission' includes the Vice-President and a Senior Deputy President as well as the President and a Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This amendment is consequential on the amendments proposed to part III of the schedule to the Bill, which creates the new positions in the Industrial Relations Commission. It will mean that, as is the case now, any presidential member is able to be appointed as Chairman of the Defence Forces Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA> Schedule, Part 3, page 6 to page 10, proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988, omit the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's amendment removes that section of the Bill that refers to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. It leaves intact the amendments that relate to the Defence Act 1903 and to the Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Act 1989, and the later amendments that relate to the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975. However, it is the amendments that relate specifically to the Industrial Relations Act to which the Liberal and National parties take strong exception, as I indicated in the second reading debate last night. This is because we believe that this part of the legislation is the first step towards the establishment of a separate labour court, which could well have the effect of removing the jurisdiction over industrial relations from the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court of Australia, where the Opposition believes that it should properly remain. </PARA>
<PARA> The clauses that we seek to remove inculcate within the Australian Industrial Relations Commission new classifications that are clearly linked to the industrial jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the future creation of a labour court. Under the amendments that the Government has proposed in this legislation it is intended that the new senior deputy presidents will also sit as judges in such a labour court. Yet, we argue that members of the Industrial Relations Commission, however well qualified in the law, are not judges. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the proposal for a labour court was on the Government's agenda back in 1987. As I said last night, it was removed as a result of strong community opposition to that proposal contained within the draft legislation to amend the then Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1987, as was the proposal for instituting a minimum size for unions, to facilitate the creation of mega-unions. Just as the Government last year passed legislation through this Parliament to put mega-unions back on the agenda and specific legislation to assist in their creation, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has now indicated that the future creation of a labour court is back on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that it is quite unacceptable to have a special labour court judging matters of law in relation to industrial relations. Undoubtedly, and indeed as this legislation would indicate, members of such a new labour court would be appointed from the Industrial Relations Commission or related networks, which have been weaned on the ethos of the industrial relations club. Obviously, matters of industrial relations that are taken to court for appeal are matters of legal interpretation of the industrial relations legislation or of Industrial Relations Commission decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case, if the Industrial Relations Commission's decision itself is under appeal to a court, obviously it would be a case of Caesar appealing to Caesar if that appeal were dealt with by a labour court so specially constructed rather than by the Federal Court or the High Court, which we would regard as being a more appropriate venue for such an appeal to be heard. There is also the possibility that the establishment of a labour court could be used to remove the right of resort to common law actions, which have been very successful in recent years in solving disputes and beating union intimidation. I gave examples of those last night in the form of the Dollar Sweets and Mudginberri disputes as being very successful in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this legislation is not only unnecessary but in fact is directing industrial relations completely down the wrong road; that there ought to be industrial relations legal interpretations directed towards the existing court structures, where that is appropriate. We believe that there is simply no need, and indeed it is a backward step approach, to look towards the establishment of a labour court. Rather, we would urge that the Government get on with solving some of the real problems of industrial relations, to build a more competitive industrial relations structure, a more productive industrial climate in Australia, and deal with the problems that are very much in evidence in our industrial relations system at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer, of course, to problems relating to the waterfront. The waterfront was referred to by Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) during Question Time today, when he claimed that the Opposition was misrepresenting the situation with regard to the number of redundancies that had occurred. He claimed that, rather than the relatively small number which the Opposition claimed had occurred with regard to redundancies on the waterfront, in fact some 1,200 redundancies had taken place since the Government's waterfront reform program had been initiated. However, in virtually the same breath he then admitted that some 600 of those redundancies were redundancies by way of attrition-in other words, redundancies which would have happened anyway, whether or not any specific proposals for waterfront reform were under way by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That indicates the way in which the Government is, if you like, running scared with regard to its achievements on waterfront reform. Within the successes which it claims to be achieving it is counting the numbers of redundancies which would have occurred anyway, irrespective of any reform process being undertaken. That is an area of industrial relations reform which needs much greater and more urgent attention. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the need to get rid of the cosy but illegal arrangements regarding trans-Tasman shipping, which not only make it unprofitable to ship Australian cars to New Zealand compared with the cost of shipping them direct from Japan but also, at a time when they can ill afford it, threaten Australian wheat growers with the loss of the traditional markets that they have for wheat in New Zealand. It is already difficult enough for Australian wheat growers to compete with subsidised American wheat but when they now have to compete on the basis that it is cheaper to ship wheat from the west coast of the United States to New Zealand than it is to ship it from Australia to New Zealand because of the continuation of this trans-Tasman accord-which precludes other than Australian or New Zealand shipping from transport across the Tasman-it simply exacerbates the very serious situation which our wheat growers are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said last night, what we really need in this country is genuine enterprise based industrial relations, not the Clayton's enterprise bargaining which this Government is currently instituting-adopting the language of enterprise bargaining but not the reality. We want this Government to get on with establishing genuine and real enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the areas that the Government should be directing its attention to-not putting up legislation such as this which simply further entrenches the centralised industrial relations system with the potential creation of a labour court. It is for that reason that the Opposition moves the amendment which seeks to remove part 3 from this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to oppose this amendment. Part 3 of this Bill, the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), is critical to the construction of a strong, independent Australian Industrial Relations Commission that the Australian Democrats have consistently supported. I must say that the Opposition has also been consistent; on every possible occasion it has attempted to dismantle, destroy or negate the essential model that is being constructed by the Government. The Democrats are unapologetic in identifying with that model.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of this amendment is to negate the most important process of amending the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and strengthening the position of the Commission. I believe that most Australians support, as indeed yesterday Senator Durack in a debate in this place said that the Opposition supports, a strong and independent Industrial Relations Commission. The Democrats would argue that the intention of this part of the Bill before us is to do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not support this amendment by the Opposition either. We have outlined in our second reading speech what the purposes of all these amendments, which are bracketed under the heading of the Gleeson committee of inquiry amendments to this Act. In my reply to the second reading debate, I dealt at some length with why it is that the Opposition is backing the wrong horse in this particular race. There is no purpose served by my regurgitating that argument here now. But I do say, because I think it is instructive, that what the Opposition is saying is not replying to the merit we have put as to why these amendments are necessary. It is not replying to the reasoning and consideration of the Gleeson committee-an eminent committee charged by the Government with examining, independently of the Government, what should be the arrangements in the Commission and reporting to us-and it is not challenging the fact that we are adopting in legislation the recommendation of that committee without alteration. What the Opposition is giving as its reason for opposing these amendments is that we may do something else in the future. So the merit of the case is not argued; rather, what may happen-an illusion-is argued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later this year it may be that the Government brings back some legislation for a labour court; it may not be. Those matters are not determined at this stage. There is a process of consultation in train about them. The Government cocks a genuinely interested ear in the views of the parties so that any legislation that might be forthcoming can be legislation which incorporates their views and is, as much as possible, a consensus proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Opposition seems to have dug itself in without waiting for the arguments, without listening to the rational views, without taking on board the considerations of the main players and without looking at the public interest. The Opposition has dug itself into a view of trenchant opposition to something that it itself improperly describes and inarticulately explains. That is not our problem; I guess that is the Opposition's problem. There may be a debate about this later in the year but, in view of what has been put, we see no reason to be persuaded from our position and we oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> That these Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1990-91</PARA>
<PARA>In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1990-91, appropriations totalling $1.9 million additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1990-91 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the Parliamentary Departments. The increase sought relates primarily to essential and unavoidable costs associated with activities of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, including the effects of the recent decision to televise Question Time in both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 5) 1990-91</PARA>
<PARA>In Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91, appropriations totalling $274.4 million-additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1990-91-are sought for Capital Works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, advances and loans, and for other services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The additional appropriations are sought to meet certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the Budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the Government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1990-91 include:</PARA>
<PARA>* $25 million in payments to the States and Territories as compensation for loss of revenue resulting from the new companies and securities regulation arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA>* $14 million for a higher level of assistance for pharmacy restructuring;</PARA>
<PARA>* $75 million for natural disaster relief and restoration, mainly in relation to the widespread cyclones and flooding in eastern Australia since March 1990. This will bring the total Commonwealth allocation this financial year to $155 million, a record level of assistance and about half the total expenditure expected to be made by the States on these measures in 1990-91. The bulk of this total allocation will go to NSW ($90 million) and Queensland ($58 million), largely for the restoration of essential State and community infrastructure, such as roads; other beneficiaries will be those individuals who suffered personal hardship and distress, as well as small business people and farmers who are receiving concessional assistance for the restoration of damaged working assets. The figure for NSW includes $28 million for restoration work in Newcastle, reflecting the Commonwealth's long term commitment following the December 1989 earthquake;</PARA>
<PARA>* $32 million payment to Victoria in lieu of petroleum royalties, as a consequence of the revised Petroleum Tax arrangements; and</PARA>
<PARA>* $25 million for the purchase of Telecom's equity in AUSSAT Pty Ltd. The Government has decided to purchase TELECOM's 25 per cent shareholding in AUSSAT following the decision to sell AUSSAT together with the second network carrier licence. After assessment of the market value of AUSSAT's shares, and the value of the shareholding to TELECOM, it has been agreed that the shares be purchased from TELECOM for $25 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Robert Ray made a cheap jibe at the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party and attacked my colleague Senator Macdonald. The Deputy President at the time named Senator Macdonald because he was so incensed at the attack made upon him. My thoughts went back to last year when the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland presented a report in relation to donations made to the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in Queensland and the operation of a fund known as the Caspalp promotion fund. I read from that report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>An account was opened by the Caspalp promotion fund in the name of Edmund Denis Casey-</PARA>
<PARA>then the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in the Parliament in Queensland-</PARA>
<PARA>Leslie John Yewdale and Malcolm James McMillan. </PARA>
<PARA>I read further from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>On an unknown date in early March 1980, it appears that Casey met with a man named Vibert to discuss the club poker machine issue in relation to the forthcoming State election. Vibert confirmed the areas of discussion and agreements in a letter to Casey dated 13 March 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from that letter:</PARA>
<PARA>I would like a decision on support for their campaign. At this stage, I would propose a $10,000 contribution with another promise for July-if all is going well-another $10,000 and a further $5,000 in September. </PARA>
<PARA>On 1 July 1980 a cheque for $10,000 drawn on the Ainsworth distributors account was made out to Caspalp promotions. A further cheque was received for $10,000 and drawn on 24 October 1980 on the Ainsworth distributors account, made out to and received by Caspalp promotions. There was a further cheque for $10,000, so a total of $30,000 in all was drawn on the Ainsworth distributors account and made out to Caspalp promotions. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these matters because I was the President of the Liberal Party in Queensland at the time. Vibert approached me and tried to bribe the Liberal Party in Queensland to change our attitude towards poker machines. I have not mentioned this previously in a public arena. I threw him out of the office. Honourable senators could understand Senator Macdonald's agitation today when Senator Robert Ray made allegations about the Liberal Party in Queensland, saying that we were prone to accepting money of a tainted nature when the very opposite occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> It is documented, recorded and acknowledged by the ALP in Queensland that it received $30,000 from the Ainsworth poker machine lobby in the presence of Vibert. The only thing that is not acknowledged is that it changed its policy in relation to poker machines, but it is evident from the chronology that one would have to be more than somewhat sceptical of that denial when prior to that time the Labor Party was not in favour of the development of poker machines in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I rise to record in the Senate the occurrence of those events; the fact that Vibert tried to bribe the Liberal Party in Queensland; the fact that the Liberal Party rejected that bribe and in fact threw Vibert out of the office; and the fact that money was received by the ALP in Queensland and $30,000 in all has been acknowledged and recorded by the Criminal Justice Commission. It is a travesty for Senator Robert Ray to make that jibe about the Queensland Liberal Party in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed that the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) By government decision, and in accordance with established Accommodation Guidelines, each Senator is entitled to an electorate office at Government expense at a location of his or her choice within the relevant State; each Member of the House of Representatives is entitled to an electorate office at Government expense either at a location of his or her choice within his or her electorate or in the Commonwealth Parliament Offices located in the relevant State capital city. In addition, Members representing the electorates of Maranoa, Kalgoorlie, Kennedy, Northern Territory, Leichhardt, Grey, Riverina-Darling and O'Connor are entitled to a second electorate office at Government expense at a location of their choice within their electorate.</PARA>
<PARA> Requests for the establishment or relocation of electorate offices are approved by me. Fitout costs require my approval.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) (b) (c) (d) See attached schedule. (a) annual rental quoted is the current amount applicable. (b) amount shown is based on estimated cost of outgoings for the 1991/92 financial year. In addition to costs for cleaning, security, electricity and maintenance of the electorate office, outgoings may include a bulk allocation for charges such as legal and valuation fees relating to the initial leasing of the office and operational costs (a percentage of the general cleaning, insurance, maintenance, parks and gardens upkeep, power, air conditioning and administration) relating to the building complex in which the electorate office is located.
