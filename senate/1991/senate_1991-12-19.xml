<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread concern and outrage in the international community about the Salvadoran government's treatment of its returning refugee and internally displaced population. Since the signing of the San Jose Agreement on Human Rights by the Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front under the mediation of the United Nations, we have been hopeful for an improvement in the Salvadoran government's treatment of its civilian population, particularly those in the repatriate communities and the social movement. Every Article of the Agreement under Section 1. Respect for and Guarantee of Human Rights, has been violated by the Salvadoran government and its armed forces. The international community is aware more than ever before of the systematic intimidation and harassment including capture, torture, rape and murder of members of repatriate communities and the social movement by the Salvadoran armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only conclude that the Salvadoran government's lack of control of its armed forces is indicative of its own lack of real commitment to a negotiated peaceful solution to the civil war. It appears, furthermore, that the Salvadoran government is unwilling to honour Agreements to which it is signatory, including international Conventions on Human Rights, and in doing so places itself above international law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international community, including the Australian government, has a common interest in the peaceful resolution to the conflict and the initiation of a genuine free democratic process in El Salvador. We therefore call upon the Australian government to:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make one brief remark, as Senator Vanstone did yesterday when she pointed out that 37 documents were tabled yesterday to be dealt with in half an hour. Some of them were very important matters. Today we have not 37 but 41 documents, including such important ones as the Commissioner of Taxation annual report and the report under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984, which outlines the consultants engaged under that Act. Other documents include taxation statistics for 1989-90, the Department of the Treasury annual report, and reports on Australia and the World Bank, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Australian Securities Commission. There is an enormous volume of very important material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I raise this, pointing out that it is grossly unsatisfactory for us to be hit with these on the last day of sitting and given only half an hour to talk about all 41, is that many of these reports were in draft form and available at Senate Estimates committee hearings. Some of us in the Opposition were very grateful for the existence of these reports in draft form at those hearings and thanked the departments for going to the trouble of doing so. It is particularly distressing to see the extraordinary amount of time between the preparation of the draft reports and the final presentation of the reports to the Parliament. It is simply unsatisfactory; it is unfair; and it prevents proper discussion of these matters of some substance. </PARA>

We have 30 minutes this afternoon in which to cover 40-odd documents. As has been said, a large percentage of those documents deal with areas of great concern and interest to honourable senators around this chamber. They include Australia and the World Bank; the operations of the IMF and World Bank; the Health Insurance Commission; the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; the Australian Institute of Health; and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.

I have never believed that it is so. This matter came up recently at a committee hearing when it was said that a particular organisation could make an annual report to the Parliament, as though that discharges our audit and control functions over that body. It does not. This is becoming a farce.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am entirely sympathetic with the remarks made by Senator Michael Baume and Senator Harradine, and indeed with, although we will give some thought to it, the notice of motion Senator Kernot gave on a similar matter. It is intolerable that on the last day of sitting of the Senate we have so many reports put down by the Government. At one stage the Senate was scheduled to rise last Thursday.

The remaining business of the Senate could be sensibly set out and we could see how the final three weeks of sitting could be determined in an orderly way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I will take a little time on this matter, if I may. This report is the result of a reference by the Senate to the Committee, in the terms that are set out at the commencement of the report. If the inspiration for it can be placed at anyone's door, it would be at the door of Senator Spindler, who urged that this matter be taken up, and in the light of his representations it was taken up. It has been an interesting time working on this report. I think it would be fair to say that at the commencement of proceedings the majority of those on the Committee thought along a particular line, and had they been asked to decide the issue at that point of time they would have come down in a way that was different from the end report. I think that has been brought about due to the evidence that was put before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a hard working committee in respect of this report. It is a good, hard working committee in respect of all the work that it does. In talking about the report presently before us, I want to thank the members of the Committee, starting with the Deputy Chair, Senator Vanstone, who, I think, is a classic example of how evidence put before the Committee can persuade people who are on it. She certainly acted on this occasion as a parliamentarian on a parliamentary committee. The same can be said for Senator Giles, whose contribution is always great and perhaps never adequately recognised. Senator Kemp put in a dissenting report on one of the main points, and I think that dissenting report indicates the balance that the Committee had to struggle with. Senator Kemp came down in respect of the recommendations on section 50 in a particular way, whereas the rest of the Committee came down in another way. In looking at the dissenting report of Senator Kemp, one can see that it has intellectual integrity, although the conclusions that he reaches are different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a dissenting report on another issue that was raised, namely, the issue of divestiture. That dissenting report was put in by Senator Spindler and Senator Schacht. Again, I think the argument that was used for that has intellectual rigour. It is my contention that the report itself has intellectual rigour and that the conclusions that the majority reached, are, on balance, the correct ones. I have mentioned Senator Schacht and Senator Spindler, and I also mention Senator O'Chee, and, of course, the redoubtable Senator Peter Walsh, who needs no introduction. I also want to thank another honourable senator, who was not on the Committee but who brought material to the Committee and made submissions to it, which in the end proved quite crucial: in this context I mention Senator Boswell, who has helped the Committee and whose contribution has been considerable indeed. I hope that he is moved to make some comments on the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to say quickly that perhaps the most weighty matter that the Committee considered was what to do with section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, whether to leave it as it was, which, in effect, to use some jargon here, was to leave the dominance test, as it is presently set out in that section, or to move to a test which required that there be no merger or acquisition if there was a substantial lessening of competition in a substantial market for goods and services. The Committee has moved to the second test. In this, it has moved away from the recommendations that were made by the Griffiths committee, a most considerable committee chaired by the Hon. Alan Griffiths, Minister for Resources. It was the majority view of the Committee that it was desirable to take on the new test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made other significant recommendations. For example, it has recommended&mdash;this may be controversial&mdash;that section 52A, which refers to unconscionable conduct, be repealed and that the common law be relied upon. It is the view of the Committee that the common law does give people generally&mdash;not only consumers but also small business and, indeed, big business if the occasion arises&mdash;an ability to go before the courts if the conduct that has been carried out is so unconscionable that some interference should occur. In taking away and repealing that section, the Committee has recommended that the Trade Practices Commission be given the ability to bring actions on behalf of anyone for whom it considers it appropriate to do so, and that proper finance be made available to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the members of the Committee and also Senator Boswell. It is only right that I do so. I also record thanks to the secretariat, led by Mr Frank Tallarita, the Secretary, who was very ably assisted by Mr James Warmenhoven. I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report sets out the findings of the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the adequacy of existing legislative controls over mergers, monopolies and acquisitions as well as the regulation of unconscionable conduct in commercial transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of reference of the inquiry required the Committee to have particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the appropriate test that should apply in s50;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether compulsory pre-merger notification should be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether, in situations of existing market dominance, the Trade Practices Commission should be able to examine conduct in addition to that already covered by s46;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the extension of s52A (which deals with unconscionable conduct) to all commercial dealings;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.any other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has made 21 recommendations of a wide ranging nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appropriate test in section 50</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found the economic material concerning the effects of acquisitions and mergers, presented to the inquiry, was illative rather than definitive. The evidence that mergers yield productive efficiencies remains equivocal. Nor is it clear that such efficiencies as have occurred have in fact improved the international competitiveness of Australian firms or resulted in demonstrable benefits to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A body of economic research now suggests that international competitiveness, both in large and small nations, is achieved not by encouraging companies to merge but by encouraging them to compete. The Competitive Advantage of Nations by Professor Michael Porter was frequently cited before the Committee. While his work does not deal directly with Australia, it was generally treated with considerable respect by those who made submissions to the Committee. The thrust of Professor Porter's work supports a change to section 50.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to what section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 should set out as the appropriate test, the Committee, by a majority, has recommended that it be amended to prohibit mergers which would have the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market for goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Authorisation is a process unique to Australia among those countries which regulate trade practices. The Committee views authorisation as a necessary and appropriate mechanism for balancing the need for competition and the need for the public to benefit; for example by Australia developing economies of scale to compete successfully in world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee sympathises with business concerns that the law governing mergers be certain and predictable. The dominance threshold has been in operation since 1977, and the courts have made a number of decisions setting precedents as to its meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that any uncertainty changes to the test might bring can be reduced significantly by the incorporation into the Act of statutory guidelines, for example along the lines of the Canadian model.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee emphasises that change should not be introduced lightly. Amendments to the Trade Practices Act may bring about uncertainty and this should not be readily risked. On the other hand, if reform is needed, it should be made unless the harm caused by it outweighs the good obtained. The Committee considers that change is needed to s.50 of the Trade Practices Act and that the benefit likely to flow from it will clearly outweigh any detriment that may arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Different submissions treat particular mergers and acquisitions that have taken place in varying ways. However there is a substantial body of material before the Committee expressing concern about those such as that of The Herald and Weekly Times by News Limited, that of Berger and British Paints by ICI (Dulux), that of McPherson's Steel by Tubemakers, and the joining together of Coles and Myer. The Committee observes there is a significant number of responsible people and organisations with as much disquiet about mergers and acquisitions that have taken place in the last few years. It seems appropriate to the Committee that ones of a similar nature should be closely examined in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significantly, the dominance test where applicable internationally is often accompanied by a presumption of dominance at market shares of around 25% or 33%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thrust of the submissions the Committee received from small business and from farmers was generally in the one direction. They argued for a change in section 50. Proper regard must be had for their proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Material put before the Committee giving a consumer's perspective on section 50 sought a change in it. This must be given due weight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Griffiths Report which was tabled in May 1989 was one of high standard. The majority recommended that no change be made to section 50 of the Trade Practices Act. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has great respect for the Report. However, it had to decide the issues before it on the material available to it. Further, since the tabling of the Griffiths Report there has been a considerable shift towards increasing competition in the marketplace as a means of giving Australia a better economic outlook. An amendment to section 50 in the terms suggested by the Committee is a means towards that end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those countries having most in common with Australia have legislation similar to the Trade Practices Act. A goodly proportion of them operate under the `lessening of competition' test. Australia would be bringing itself into line with them were it to adopt that test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 50 deals with the structure of corporations. The rest of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act deals with conduct. The sections dealing with conduct impose more rigorous limitations on it than does section 50 on structures. There would be more consistency in the Act were structure and conduct dealt with generally in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that, to make clear the ambit of the new test, guidelines be incorporated in the Trade Practices Act 1974. The guidelines should contain criteria including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the level of concentration in the market;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the likely level of foreign competition in the market;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the availability of product substitutes;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">barriers to entry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether one party to the merger is a failing firm;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the likelihood that the proposed merger would remove a vigorous and effective competitor;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the extent to which effective competition remains or would remain in the market;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">change and innovation in the market;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ability to significantly increase prices following a merger; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any other factors relevant to competition in a market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that where a proposed merger fails to meet the test including the guidelines the Trade Practices Commission should nevertheless have the power to authorise it when it is for the benefit of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory pre-merger notification</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has operated an informal system of pre-merger notification for some years. While this system is a useful one, the Committee accepts that the TPC does not receive sufficient notice of impending mergers and at times encounters difficulty in giving them detailed and prompt consideration. There are a number of countries similar to Australia which require pre-merger notification. The OECD has suggested to its members that they should follow suit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that it be obligatory for a notice to be given to the TPC where mergers or acquisitions of a substantial nature are proposed. What is a matter of a substantial nature should be defined in the Act. The contents required should be limited so that undue burden is not cast on those who must provide them. The Committee has recommended that the details of the scheme be drawn up by the Attorney-General's Department and released for public comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory notification and sensitive industries</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepts that certain industries need to be dealt with by taking into account factors in addition to economic ones. These currently include the media. The Committee notes that some `sensitive' industries such as insurance and banking are currently governed by specific legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that issues such as social and cultural ones are outside the ambit of the Trade Practices Act and should be dealt with in discrete legislation. The Trade Practices Act should remain concerned specifically with fair competition in the market place and the protection of consumers. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that section 50 continue to confine its operation to protecting competition. Where there are other than economic issues involved in industry structure or ownership, they may be dealt with in specific legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pre-notification, authorisation and the Trade Practices Tribunal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that parties proposing to merge continue to have the ability to approach the TPC seeking authorisation (with a right of appeal to the Trade Practices Tribunal) or alternatively to have the option of directly approaching the Tribunal. The Committee has recommended that strict time limits be imposed on both processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that adequate funding be made available to the Commission and the Tribunal to enable this to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Misuse of market power: s46</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepts that the proof of purpose under section 46 poses considerable difficulties for the TPC and other litigants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposals to extend the section by the incorporation of an effects test would undoubtedly encourage its greater use by litigants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee accepts that in a provision directed explicitly at misuse of market power it is appropriate that a distinction between purpose and consequence be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepts that effective competition involves engaging in conduct the potential effect of which may be to produce the very ends proscribed in section 46. To better enable purpose to be established under section 46, the Committee has recommended that it be amended to provide that although the TPC has the overall onus of proving a breach of that section when it has brought forward evidence which makes it as likely as not that one has occurred then one will be taken to have occurred unless the corporation in question shows otherwise. This recommendation should facilitate the proof of purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended, by a majority, that serious and persistent abuses of market power should be dealt with by serious increased monetary penalties and not through a remedy of divestiture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unconscionable conduct: s52A</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has considered the possible extension of the unconscionable conduct provisions in s52A to commercial dealings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepts that any attempt to confine a statutory prohibition against commercial conduct to small business would be arbitrary, artificial and productive of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its introduction, s52A has been used rarely as a remedy. It does not enhance the protection afforded by the common law. The Committee considers that the common law provides sufficient remedies for people who have suffered through unconscionable conduct, particularly as the courts in Australia have shown a willingness to develop to meet new situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers it would be better for those who suffer from the unconscionable conduct of others were their remedies left to the common law, and were the TPC to be given the power of bringing actions on their behalf and of bearing the burden of costs. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that s52A be repealed and that legislation be introduced giving the TPC the ability to bring proceedings on behalf of a person who has a right at common law and to pay the costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal will allow the TPC to assist a significantly wider range of persons and will give them relief as to costs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on two aspects of the report tabled today by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mergers, Monopolies and Acquisitions</EMPHASIS>. In particular, I wish to address section 50 and the recommendation of the Committee that the criterion used for determining whether an acquisition or merger can proceed should be changed from dominance of a market, as it is currently, to the likely effect such a merger or acquisition will have of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market for goods and services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received many submissions on that particular aspect of the matter. It is true to say, as the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Cooney, has said, that the Committee finally decided on a judgment of the balance between the various views put forward. In the past, the lesser test was supported very much because it was thought that it eliminated inefficient industries and companies and that it also increased the international competitive capacity of Australian enterprises by giving them additional size and therefore the ability to utilise economies of scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detriment that would be part of any such acquisitions and mergers&mdash;namely, the creation of a monopoly or duopoly&mdash;was considered as being secondary to those first two considerations. However, we have seen substantial changes in our industrial capacity and the view has been reached that economies of scale are not necessarily the main factor in achieving international competitive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has heard considerable evidence, including the seminal work by Professor Porter, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Competitive Advantage of Nations</EMPHASIS>, which indicated not only that the factor of economies of scale is now of a secondary nature with a higher degree of technology being utilised but also that to achieve international competitiveness it is essential to expose companies to competition in the domestic market so that they may hone their capacity to compete abroad. The advantage of that course of action is that Australian consumers and small businesses are able to benefit from the higher level of competition that such a policy would create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular change had its beginnings in an amendment that I moved to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill on 16 May this year. While the Government at that stage was not prepared to accept these arguments, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I now acknowledge that, following the acceptance by the Government of the terms of reference from the Government and the Opposition, we now have this recommendation of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Senator Cooney, the Chairman of the Committee, was gracious to acknowledge the beginnings of this reference. I wish to acknowledge the patience, tolerance, diligence and incisive legal mind that Senator Cooney, as Chairman of this Committee, has brought to this particular inquiry. In initiating the inquiry, I was conscious of the fact that the Committee was in fact overloaded with work. I appreciated all the more the assiduous work that was done not only by the Chairman but also by every member of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be remiss if I did not pay tribute also to the secretariat&mdash;Mr Frank Tallarita, Mr James Warmenhoven and Ms Fiona Matthews&mdash;who very ably supported the work of the Committee and without whose assistance this inquiry would not have been possible to pursue. I believe the inquiry turned out to be rather more massive and rather more far-reaching than we thought at the beginning. There will be more opportunity later on to debate the very important issues that this report has placed on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the dissenting report which I am glad to say I share with Senator Chris Schacht. That goes to the question of divestiture. We believe that there is a need for the remedy of divestiture in the case of serious and persistent misuse of market power. Section 46 does deal with the misuse of market power and prohibits corporations with a substantial degree of market power from taking advantage of that power for certain purposes. These purposes are eliminating or substantially damaging competitors, preventing new entrants into a market, or deterring or preventing others from engaging in competitive conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department believes that such breaches of section 46 should be addressed through increased monetary penalties. However, they are hardly sufficient to rectify a situation once we have on record persistent and serious misuse of market power. I quote from Professor Baxt's evidence. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unless you have a remedy, like the Americans, the Canadians and the Europeans have which enables their courts to say, `You have to divest certain parts of your operations', then you are not going to be able to get to the heart of the problem in these situations.</PARA>
<PARA>We therefore believe that divestiture should be available as a remedy in such cases. It has been suggested that no situations have so far arisen in Australia where divestiture would have been warranted. Whether or not this is so, I consider that, given the high levels of industry concentration in Australia, particularly in the current wave of deregulation and privatisation, it is likely that such a situation could arise in the future. The Trade Practices Act should provide remedies capable of dealing with such situations effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should stress that one does not see divestiture as a remedy which would be commonly and often used. The Committee has been told that it is a rarely and reluctantly used remedy in those jurisdictions where it is available. But the fact that it is available and can be used by courts in appropriate circumstances and has not been withdrawn, despite agitation by interest groups, remains a telling factor in evaluating its appropriateness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just witnessed another step in the continuing concentration of media ownership in Australia. This must be one of the major concerns that we face when we talk of misuse of market power. We are addressing an area which can affect the very fibre of our democratic system. It is with more than a sidelong glance at those developments that I believe this dissenting report calling for divestiture as a remedy should be noted by the Senate and the Government. I trust that this dissenting report by Senator Schacht and myself will be the start of another battle which ultimately will have to be won. </PARA>

I will speak briefly in view of the pressure of other business. When the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 comes back to be debated, there will be opportunities for honourable senators to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main reason I wish to speak is that, together with Senator Spindler, I have put in a dissenting report on one aspect of the legislation, namely, divestiture. Firstly, I congratulate Senator Cooney and all the other members of the Committee for their work on this piece of legislation, and the seriousness with which they went about the work of dealing with an extremely complex piece of legislation that has an impact way beyond that of most pieces of legislation in our community. In this legislation we are dealing with, as we would say, the top end of town, the big picture and so on. This legislation can have dramatic effects on the lives of many ordinary Australian citizens, and the Committee accepted that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the Committee unanimously recommended a change in the test for mergers and acquisitions from dominance of the market to a substantial lessening of competition. That is an excellent step forward. I trust that the Government and the Opposition will take this report and its recommendations very seriously. I already suspect that the Leader of the National Party in this place is enthusiastic for that test. It is a big step forward for the old agrarian socialists who come on board. I hope that the debate in the broader political process on this issue will start from this report. I also hope that some time in the near future the Government can bring forward legislation to accept the unanimous report on this section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the view that in the trade practices area we are really dealing with the way in which Australia sees its future role in international competition. Once one moves away from a mercantilist view of world trade and international competition and sees that we need an internationally competitive economy, one, therefore, has to put in place mechanisms that guarantee that that competition is effective for our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, in a more deregulated and internationally competitive economy, we will have investments from many major corporations from overseas which, with their large financial resources, may be able literally to buy up an Australian industry. It seems to me that we have to put in place mechanisms to control and take action where the marketplace is adversely affected, against the interests of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present test for dominance of the market is too soft and limited. I know that there will be arguments from lawyers about what the substantial lessening of competition means. I suspect that whatever we put forward in this Bill will mean big employment opportunities for lawyers, but that is unavoidable and I cannot think of a way around it. If I could, I would have put in a further dissenting report. Nevertheless, a substantial lessening of competition, on all the evidence we received, is clearly a tougher test to be met. Therefore, it is an excellent part of our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to divestiture powers. If we are to have an internationally competitive economy and encourage more efficient industry in Australia, we will need a sanction in the business sector that companies which persistently and wilfully misuse their power in the marketplace will have to pay the ultimate penalty of divestiture of part of their operations. The fact that that power is there will mean that some people will be more careful than they are now; they will always be looking over their shoulder if this power is sitting in the legislation. I do not believe that it would be often used in Australia, but I agree with Senator Spindler that, with the way the world economy is developing and the way that multinational and transnational companies are establishing worldwide operations, it is more likely to be a possibility in the future that such a test and such a power will be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very strong test to be applied to a total divestiture power is that it must be in the national interest. If the Trade Practices Commission told an operation in Australia that it had to divest because it had wilfully misused its power, there would be a public process via a hearing and court cases. If people argued that, no, it is in the national interest that this company maintains its operations, then governments, consumer groups and other groups in the community could put their views. It would be a public, transparent process which would be very good for the public process and the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many cases where a monopoly in Australia can be justified. For example, the steel industry is basically run by BHP. In my view, it would be bonkers to suggest that it should divest several of its steelworks because it dominates the market. In the last decade, the Australian Government introduced and operated a steel plant&mdash;to which the taxpayers contributed several hundred million dollars&mdash;to revamp the steel industry so that it would not collapse. That money overwhelmingly went to BHP. It seems to me that it is in the national interest to argue that that dominance should be allowed to continue as far as the size of its share of the market is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If BHP misuses its power in providing steel to customers, the remedies are already there: it can be forced to provide steel at reasonable prices; and action can be taken against it for predatory pricing. I must say that, in the end, if BHP  acted in such a way over a long period and did not respond to previous decisions of the Trade Practices Commission, it would run the risk of being forced to divest something. But part of that process would have to be done publicly, with government arguing one way or the other, and everyone would have an opportunity to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise, as did Senator Spindler, that divestiture is an action of last resort, but unless there is that action of last resort, the other penalties are inadequate. Fines of millions of dollars are peanuts for an industry that has a revenue base of billions of dollars. But if companies were told that they would have to lose part of their operations&mdash;which is worth $500m, and would affect their profits&mdash;that risk would make them think twice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to an example of this approach which is mentioned at page 139 of the dissenting report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, should either Australian Airlines or Ansett Australia refuse to supply Compass with adequate airport leasing space, and if such a refusal amounted to a misuse of market power, then the court should be able to order the `divestment' of a portion of the existing lease space to Compass, or even order a reduction in the term of the leases held by Australian or Ansett.</PARA>
<PARA>Today we have newspaper reports that Compass is in serious financial difficulty. One of the arguments being put is that it does not get decent access to the existing gateway facilities in all the Australian terminals which, I understand, have 20-year leases signed. It seems clear to me that this is one case where divestiture is a reasonable power with which to threaten the airlines. I am sure the threat of it would make Ansett and Australian Airlines much more reasonable in the negotiations. It would seem to me that, if this is one of the reasons why Compass runs into difficulty and goes out of existence, it proves the need for divestiture power to be in the Act as a last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I commend the dissenting report. I of course point out to the Senate that I am a member of the Government party. There will be debate within the Government about these amendments and so on, and I will have my say in those forums as well. Naturally, as a loyal member of the Government, if the Government decides not to accept all of my views, that is my tough luck. I will of course be supporting the Government's final position. But I think the debate has started and I do not think there is an intransigent view on any side of politics that this matter is black and white or all or nothing. I congratulate Senator Cooney and the other members of the Committee for beginning what I think will be an excellent debate which, in the long run, will enhance the operation of competition in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received this report on mergers, monopolies and acquisitions only in the last 10 minutes. Therefore, I have not been able to go into the whole report; I have looked only briefly at the recommendations on the first couple of pages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased with the recommendations that this report has brought down. I, too, would like to pass on my congratulations to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I think one of the main problems facing business in Australia today is the market domination that has been allowed to aggregate and to force small business to take lesser prices for its production and its manufacturing products. It has been going on for some time. Eighty per cent of the grocery trade in Australia is owned by overseas companies and the aggregations in the grocery trade have been going along at a very rapid pace. This Committee report addresses some of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be said that it is like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted, but we have to make a start somewhere. The Committee has taken on the problems and it has looked at the difference between the two tests: the lessening of competition in a substantial market for goods and services and the present market domination test. I can understand why, in 1977, the Government at the time opted for the market domination test in order to get huge economies of scale so that we could be more competitive in international markets. But the fact is that it simply has not worked. We are no great export power and what has happened is that we have lost efficiencies in our smaller domestic productions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For any market to take on exports it must have a very solid domestic market, and 99 per cent of manufacturers and food processors who export require a very solid domestic market. Unless that domestic market returns a profit and can give guarantees that the company will be profitable, then it has very little base upon which to build a competitive overseas export market. The report addresses this matter and I think Senator Cooney has done a magnificent job as Chairman of this Committee. Quite frankly, I think small business in Australia&mdash;and I include the manufacturing and smaller retail sector, primary industry, the farmers, and their processing companies such as Golden Circle, Berri, Letona, Ardmona and SPC&mdash;will welcome this report with open arms. It is what it has been seeking for the last five or six years, or even longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can talk with some knowledge about this subject because before I came into this place I was a merchant and I experienced personally the market domination that was rampant in 1983. From my questioning of industry at the moment, it seems that it has only got worse between 1983 and 1991. Manufacturers have said to me, `I can cop high interest rates, I can cop union demands and I can cop lower demand caused by the recession, but one thing I cannot cop is 80 per cent of my business going to four or five customers. If I lose one of those customers I lose 25 per cent of my throughput through my factory'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when a manufacturer is faced with that throughput or percentage of his market going to one customer, that customer has huge purchase leverage to drive the prices down&mdash;sometimes under the cost of manufacturing. The processor or the manufacturer has to make a decision as to whether he will accept the lower prices, manufacture under cost and hold his market share; or, if he loses that particular customer by not lowering his prices, whether he can run his factory when he loses the benefits of the economies of scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my time, I have seen promotional discounts, settlement terms and corporate discounts demanded&mdash;a plethora of demands from retailers&mdash;which are screwing the prices down, sometimes, as I mentioned before, way under the cost of production. Therefore, I look forward to the time when this report becomes legislation. I am sure it will be very popular. It certainly will be popular in the cattle industry, where we have seen amalgamations and aggregations of abattoirs and where there are fewer buyers in the ring to bid for stock&mdash;and when there are fewer buyers in the ring there is less competition. That will not give a true price to a rural producer and it will not give him prices which are driven by market forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of us in this Parliament would believe sincerely that if an economy is to be driven by market forces we cannot keep pulling market forces out of the economy by amalgamations and takeovers until there are no market forces left to work. That is what is happening at the moment and we are getting artificial prices. Many of the discounts that are demanded&mdash;such as corporate discounts and advertising discounts&mdash;are not being passed on to the customers; they are being held by the mega-corporations. So this report goes a long way to solving those problems. Of course, we have to see the report accepted by the Government and it then has to pass into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other section that attracts me in this report is that the Committee recommends that section 52A of the Trade Practices Act be repealed. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It recommends that legislation be introduced giving the Trade Practices Commission the ability to bring proceedings of behalf of a person who has a right of action at common law arising from the unconscionable conduct of another.</PARA>
<PARA>That has always been extended to consumers. This report now suggests that it will be passed on to farmers and small business. That will also be very much welcomed in the small business community, where there have been cases of unconscionable conduct that has led in some circumstances to penalties being imposed on the smaller entrepreneur. Now it gives him access to a law that will give him some equity. Many small businesses just cannot afford to go to court or pay the legal costs and take on the mega-corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has given small business and primary industry a great Christmas present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating the National Road Transport Commission Bill, a very contentious piece of legislation. I am pleased to say that the National and Liberal parties strenuously oppose this legislation. At a time of economic recession, this Government legislation will increase registration costs in Australia by 300 or 400 per cent on heavy vehicles that carry 80 per cent of the domestic freight in Australia&mdash;that is, vehicles over 4 1/2 tonnes. The transport industry employs 400,000 people indirectly and employs 100,000 people directly in road transport. Road transport accounts for 9 per cent of the gross domestic product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Bill goes through, its repercussions will be felt all over Australia. There will be job shedding in the transport industry as already hard-pressed trucking operators will be unable to pay the increased cost of registration or pass those costs on to already strapped primary producers and other manufacturing industries. They will have to lay off staff, who will join the other one million people on the dole queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere will this legislation impact harder than on rural Australia, where every farm input, every tin of sheep dip, every wool bale, every piece of machinery, and all the groceries that have to be transported out into the bush, mainly on road transport at the moment, will be hit with increased registration charges that will drive up the costs to rural dwellers and rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primary industry gets hit with a double whammy when it has to transport its commodities from the farm gate to the abattoirs or the silos and then to the domestic market or to the ships which export our rural products overseas to earn much needed export dollars. An increase of 300 to 400 per cent in registration charges would further add to costs and cripple our export industries and make them less competitive at a time when we need every dollar we can earn in export income. It is ironic that the Government is putting this Bill through a day after the announcement was made that farm incomes have dropped 75 per cent on last year, which was at an all-time low base. This is further proof, if any was needed, that this Government does not care about Australian farmers or regional dwellers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission will implement the agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the States at the Special Premiers Conference, and the ACT will also join,  on uniform road regulations and road charges on heavy vehicles of 4 1/2 tonnes and over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has been on a long journey. In 1989 the Inter-State Commission report was succeeded by a report from the Department of Land Transport consultant, Mr Ted Butcher. In October last year the Special Premiers Conference looked at this report and decided to set up a working group with three reporting bodies&mdash;a regulation committee, a road funding committee and a charging committee. The working group has set the figures which I, as well as industry bodies, believe will be implemented by the National Road Transport Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does not establish the charges or the uniform rules but gives the power to the newly appointed Commission. That technically may be correct, but the new National Road Transport Commission is strictly controlled by the guidelines that are in the Bill and were in the Special Premiers Conference agreement signed by all the Premiers. The decisions the newly appointed Commission makes must be endorsed by a majority decision of the ministerial council, which consists of all transport Ministers and the Minister from the ACT and is chaired by the Federal Minister, Mr Brown. The Northern Territory has refused to be a signatory to the agreement establishing the National Road Transport Commission. The Northern Territory Government has researched the new charges and is of the opinion that the increased registration charges would increase the CPI in the Territory by between one and 2 per cent and increase transport costs by 10 to 15 per cent. </PARA>

Clause 20(3) requires that the National Commission, in recommending road charges and road use charges to the ministerial council, shall ensure that by no later than 1 July 1995 the charges it recommends will comply with the charging principles and recover fully the road costs of all vehicles, based on average annual distance travelled, except for road trains, which are to receive concessions of up to 50 per cent of full cost recovery mass-distance charges. In arriving at its recommended charges, the Bill says that the Commission is to use&mdash;it does not say it may or it will consider; the wording in the Bill is very definite&mdash;a PAYGO system for determining what expenditure is to be recovered.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table comprises the working group's figures that must be recommended by March 1992, to apply by no later than 1 January 1993, with full cost recovery phased in by July 1995, and by 1 July 2000 for road trains. In the Senate on 15 October, when I asked Senator Collins whether there would be only one charge, he replied that the National Road Transport Commission would recommend charges by March 1992 to apply by no later than 1 January 1993, that full cost recovery would be phased in by 1995, and by 1 July 2000 for road trains. What Senator Collins told the Senate is exactly what was agreed at the Special Premiers Conference and what is in the Bill. Senator Collins has agreed with the Special Premiers Conference and with the method in this legislation. It again confirms that the National Road Transport Commission has no option but to increase charges to those in the working group's figures that I have incorporated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a Senate inquiry last Wednesday we were told by officers of the Department that the charges were not set&mdash;it was up to the National Road Transport Commission to set the charges. Senator Collins also said that there were no charges set at present. The Government has never been prepared to tell the truth about increasing road charges. For 2 1/2 years we have lived with a smokescreen surrounding this, with no-one prepared to tell what the charges will be. Everyone in the industry is well aware that the charges will be those set out in the working group's table that I have incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 November the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) told the House that total charges for the increased registration would be $7,000 to $8,000. I believe this is only the first charge to be introduced in 1993 for a six-axle articulated vehicle of 42 tonnes. Mr Brown has not told the House that those charges will increase to full cost recovery by 1995 and will be $14,100. The Minister representing Mr Brown in the Senate has said that no charges have been set;  the Minister for Land Transport has said that the total charges for six-axle articulated vehicles will be $7,000 to $8,000; while the working group has responded to a formula of total cost recovery as laid down in the Special Premiers Conference agreement and as repeated in this Bill. The inescapable conclusion is that initial charges from January 1993 will be $7,750 for a six-axle articulated vehicle of 42 tonnes and full cost recovery by July 1995 will amount to $14,100. </PARA>

Last Wednesday night the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure took evidence from concerned industry groups and unionists. The witnesses told the Committee exactly how those increased charges would affect the industries and their members. Submissions were made by the National Farmers Federation, the National Transport Forum, Australian Livestock Transport, the National Transport Federation, the New South Wales Road Transport Association and the New South Wales Branch of the Transport Workers Union of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there is no confusion amongst these people because they know exactly where they are going.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two parts to the heavy vehicle charge. The first component is the increased registration charges that we have just been through. The second is a charge equal to the part of the diesel fuel tax levied by the Commonwealth for road building and maintenance. The figure bandied around by those in the know is that around 15.6c a litre would be allocated to road spending. That is certainly an improvement on the 6c a litre that is presently being spent on road maintenance. When this Government came to power in 1983, excise was 9.4c a litre, of which 6c was spent on roads. Due to automatic indexing, the excise has risen to 26c a litre,  yet the Government has only allocated the same 6c a litre to road charges, siphoning off $2.5 billion to Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>

This package is not one of economic reform. It increases charges to a sector of Australia&mdash;the trucking industry and rural Australia&mdash;that cannot afford one more cent added to its budget.

It was mentioned in the Committee that trucks may even be forced to pay the higher registration fees if they ply their trade in the higher zones. We could even see the reintroduction of the old tick gates on the border where one has to get a permit to cross the border. That may be Senator Button's idea of new federalism, but it is certainly not mine. We will turn the clock back 90-odd years to when we had customs posts at the border. That is how stupid it is.

We are also told that there will be a reduction in charges between the low cost zone and the high cost zone. In fact, the legislation sets out under clause 20 that the charges will be uniform. Mr Goss, the Queensland Premier, has never come out and told Queenslanders what the registration charges will be in Queensland and what the savings are in zone B, or the differences in savings between zone A and zone B. There is a complete contradiction in terms between the new federalism and that presently being proposed in this Bill. There will be chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is bringing in legislation, with the support of the Australian Democrats, which will increase road charges by 300 per cent to 400 per cent by 1995. The formula is set in this Bill; it is set in a Special Premiers Conference; and it has been worked out by the working group. The Commission has nowhere to go. The legislation that sets up the Commission in effect also sets up the charges. The Democrats may oppose the supplementary legislation that sets up the charges or, hopefully, they will amend it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not take into consideration any impact on regional and rural Australia.

That report was commissioned seven months ago and has not been seen&mdash;it probably will not been seen until February or March next year&mdash;yet under this legislation the newly appointed Commission is required to set the charges by 1992.

This Bill sets up a Commission which is locked into recommending higher road user charges. This Bill sets up a commission which is locked into imposing greater costs on people who live in regional areas of Australia and on industries in regional areas of Australia.

I have great pleasure in saying that it was my colleague Senator Boswell who, with me, took some members of the Commission around regional Queensland and actually showed them, for the first time, what life was like outside the capital cities, what it was like when one got further west than Toowoomba.

Later came the efforts of our friends the Liberals in Western Australia, and I acknowledge the work of Senator Panizza in that regard. It was that work that forced the Government to back down on the original proposal to introduce this charge on 1 July this year. That was the original proposal: 1 July  1991 was D-day for the road transport industry as this Government set about increasing the charges. We fought it to a standstill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government still has this crazy notion that it needs to increase the road user charges. This is not about improving the funding to the roads. Honourable senators know perfectly well that the Government gets enough money to fund the roads four times over. This is the Government that gets $6.5 billion in fuel taxation and returns $1.5 billion to the road network. Yet Government members come into this chamber and talk about full cost recovery.

The Government is getting money willy-nilly&mdash;and it wants more. It is like some cancer that has got out of control, feeding on the money of others, in this case the money of the road transport industry. It is not as though the road transport industry does not pay its way. Even if we leave out the fourfold taxation that is inherent in the fuel charges, we should look at the other taxes the Government imposes on the road transport industry&mdash;the 20 per cent sales tax on parts and on the trucks; the existing registration charges; the provisional tax; and, if they are lucky enough to make a dollar, the income tax on top of that. </PARA>

The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, and his colleagues on the other side know this very well because that is exactly what they want to do. We on this side of the chamber in the National and Liberal parties represent a completely different attitude to business and to the road transport industry.

Road transport operators who thought they were having it hard in 1971, if they are still around in 1991, would say that it was a breeze 20 years ago. In the intervening period costs have gone up something like tenfold while the actual charges have gone up only threefold. The road transport industry is the most competitive and most cost efficient in this country. Under the guise of perpetrating micro-economic reform, this Government would throw out the window and destroy the only truly efficient service industry we have. That is what it wants to do. </PARA>

As Senator Boswell has said, this Commission will make its recommendations in March 1992 for charges that are due to come into effect on 1 January 1993. But what has happened to the report on the effect on remote and regional Australia? Where is that? Will that be tabled so that the National Road Transport Commission can have a look at it and take it into consideration when making its recommendations? Of course not. It will not be on the table.

That is what the Government wanted to do with the Butcher report, and we stopped it. We intend to do everything we can to stop it again this time, because it is wholly unsatisfactory. We have a Senate committee of inquiry that will report on 11 September 1992&mdash;six months after the Commission recommends its charges. That is the truth. That is what this Government wants to do. It does not care about the effect, so long as it can get its hands on more taxpayers' money. That is all this proposal is about. </PARA>

I doubt whether the discriminatory charging regime, the discriminatory taxes that will be imposed by virtue of the different rates inherent in the registration charges, is constitutional with respect to section 51 of the Constitution. Unless every single cent of that road user charge is returned to the roads, it is not a user charge but a tax, and it is not possible to have taxes that discriminate between States. I suggest that the Government and the Minister give serious consideration to this matter because they are setting up a taxing regime that will discriminate between one State and another in regard to trade. For example, trade going between New South Wales and South Australia would be taxed at a higher rate than trade going between South Australia and Western Australia.

As it is, those potato growers are already losing money by taking the potatoes out of the ground and shipping them down to Sydney. Effectively, there will be little opportunity for the potato industry in the Atherton Tableland if this Bill goes through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look, for example, at the effect the Bill will have on the sugar industry. That industry is a big user of gypsum, which it spreads over the soil. Currently it costs $15 a tonne to buy gypsum in Brisbane, but in Bundaberg the cost of gypsum is $50 a tonne. In other words, there is a $35 a tonne freight component on that gypsum from Brisbane to Bundaberg. If one adds another 20 per cent to that&mdash;another $7&mdash;instead of that gypsum costing $50 a tonne, exorbitant as it is, it would cost $57 a tonne. The cost to the sugar industry will be quite dreadful. That industry needs gypsum to ensure that the soil is fertile and that the industry gets a good return, yet this Government intends to add to the industry's input costs. We believe that that is despicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another industry that would suffer would be the dairy industry, which is a major user of road transport in shipping milk from the producer to the dairy and from the dairy to the consumers. One only needs to look, for example, at the dairy cooperative on the Atherton Tableland to see what effect that would have. The effect is quite frightening. That dairy cooperative would be faced with hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra registration fees just on the trucks it owns itself, let alone on the transport charges it pays to other operators. It involves hundreds of thousands of dollars in higher registration charges on the trucks that it owns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are things that this Government does, yet it tells us that this is micro-economic reform. It is nothing short of micro-economic destruction for this Government to increase the charges to industry in the way it has. It will be nothing short of destructive of the efforts of that dairy cooperative to export dairy produce into South East Asia if this Government gets its way. This Government is likely to get its way because its friends, the Democrats, will support it. The Democrats pretend that they are friends of the bush and the friends of anybody else they happen to meet, but they are the same people who shamefully support an increase in road user charges. This is being done in the same manner in which the Democrats have shamefully refused to support any attempt by the coalition to reduce the cost of diesel and petrol through the abolition of the fuel tax. That is a disgusting and disgraceful public position and one that will be remembered for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the Australian people should know who are the authors of this proposal. Let them know who are the supporters of this proposal, and who will knife industry in the back through this Bill. What is for sure is that it will not be the National and Liberal parties because we oppose these provisions now and will oppose them while this Government continues to tax industry in the way in which it does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal and National parties have proposed an amendment to the National Road Transport Commission Bill 1991 which I would urge the Government seriously to consider and, in the interests of Australia, adopt as the policy of the Parliament and the Government. My colleagues in the Liberal and National parties have spoken at some length on the effects of the Bill and what it would do to Australia, and it is important for us to understand the concept of this Bill and the industry's concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill on a cursory reading is innocuous. It simply sets up the National Road Transport Commission, which seems to be not such a bad idea. However, one of the benefits of the Senate committee system is that it enables senators and the public at large to look in greater depth and detail at what the Bill really means and what lies behind the words and sentiments of what the Government proposes. I do not think many people would object to the broad thrust of the sentiments of the Bill, but when one looks at the Bill closely and understands what the industry says about it, one has real concerns as to what the Bill will do for transport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned about road transport of any nature. I live, and always have done, in the far north of Queensland where we exist because of transport&mdash;road transport, rail transport and air transport. It is particularly pleasing to find that Dr Hewson in his Fightback package has recognised the role that road freight and freight generally play in the lives and living standards of those of us who live remote from the capital cities. To that end, Dr Hewson has introduced a package of reforms which will make road transport much more cost-effective. The wholesale sales tax will be completely removed from all business inputs, but particularly the road transport industry. The 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on rigs, trucks, tyres, windscreens and repairs will go. In addition, the 26c a litre fuel and diesel excise which currently applies will be completely removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cascading effect of that will have a massive impact on the lives of those of us who live in areas remote from the capital cities because we depend so much on road, rail and air transport and on our own cars and the fuel that is used in them. That more than anything is one of the most significant reforms that have been proposed in this country, I venture to say, this century because it will mean so much in terms of the costs of shipping things by road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, when travelling with Dr Hewson in north and central Queensland, we talked to truckies. We received their enthusiastic support for the Fightback package because they recognise just what it will do not only for remote and regional Australia but also for Australia in general. The trucking industry as a whole significantly supports and enthusiastically endorses the Fightback package because of what it will do for remote and regional Australia and for the cost of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I digress slightly to mention another aspect of transport in the area I come from. It is a very sad day in the annals of the transport industry in far north Queensland and northern Australia when we see the reports today that Compass Airlines is struggling. Compass has made an enormous impact on far north Queensland and really boosted the area's tourist industry at a time when&mdash;because of this Government's actions with the pilots strike, the recession we had to have and huge interest rates&mdash;the tourist industry in far north Queensland was on its knees. It is my opinion that the significant event of Compass coming along, more than anything, saved the tourist industry in far north Queensland and really boosted it to a stage where it is now one of the most progressive industries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read with some sadness today that Compass Airlines is struggling. Compass in its first seven months of operation&mdash;in the words of its balance sheet&mdash;paid some $22m to various government coffers, and of that $22m some $2.4m went in sales tax and almost $1m went in payroll tax in that period. If the Government had the courage to adopt the Fightback package, Compass Airlines would be better off today by $3.5m. That is just one aspect of it. The flow-on effect of all of the other reductions of taxes on businesses would be enormous. </PARA>

In the figures of Compass, the $3.5m which went into government coffers would not be there under Dr Hewson's Fightback package. The industry understands that and the tourist industry generally accepts that. It is a sad day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; what a joke. I do not have to get up in Parliament here and point out to Australians the hypocrisy of the Democrats and their policy on transport because the industry is doing it for me. The industry is throwing around these press releases from the Australian Democrats and wondering how a political party that was established to keep the bastards honest can be so hypocritical and have such a deleterious effect on the national road transport industry. Senator Kernot, who has taken some interest in this and who issues these press releases around the countryside, should really wake up to herself. It would be far better that she said nothing than issue these sorts of press releases, which make the Democrats the laughing stock of the transport industry. They are scorned, and rightly so, by those people who need assistance, who want assistance, who understand that our package will give assistance but who realise that our efforts are being thwarted by the combined force of the Government, with its Right, Left and Centre Left factions, and its far left faction in the Australian Democrats. People in the industry do understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is short because we have a deal of legislation to get through on the day the Senate rises. We have been asked to keep our speeches short, which is difficult on a matter as important as this, but I want briefly to mention some of the things that happened at the inquiry held by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on this particular Bill. I am privileged to be a member of that Committee along with my Liberal Party colleagues Senators Chapman and Panizza. We spent a great number of hours listening to people make submissions on that Bill. These people had come from all over Australia at short notice because they had a very great concern about the Bill and they wanted us, as parliamentarians, to understand their concerns. As I said previously, I am particularly grateful that they came because they made me more aware of what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the Government had some members there, it might also have learned and realised that the Bill requires substantial further investigation. Senator Foreman sat through the hearing, so he would understand the submissions made, but none of his colleagues bothered to attend and the Australian Democrats did not even bother to show up. They did not even have the courtesy to listen to the submissions made by those people. </PARA>

But Senator Kernot used to be on that Committee. She understands the matter and has the carriage of it in the chamber. She could easily have been there. Senator Coulter said that after speaking to members of the industry between 7.40 and 7.50 he suddenly understood all of their concerns. In 10 minutes he was able to achieve, so he says, what those witnesses took some four, five or six hours to explain to and be questioned on by the Committee. </PARA>

It is an absolute disgrace for the Government to come along and put some proposal to this Parliament by the majority of that Committee&mdash;the Labor Party and the Democrats&mdash;when they were not even there to hear the arguments. How would they know and be able to understand what it was all about?  How could they appreciate the real problems that the people in the trucking industry had with the Bill?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just mention some of the concerns expressed by witnesses from the trucking industry. They were concerned about the independence not of the commissioners but of the Commission itself because its jurisdiction was wrong and the rules under which it was to operate were not appropriate. They were concerned that the Commission was being directed by the Labor Party in a certain area and that it would not be an independent body looking at all aspects of the road transport industry to properly consider this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a concern that the Bill was being rushed through. There was a plea by nearly all of the witnesses&mdash;which the Liberal Party members on the Committee took up&mdash;for further time to investigate the concerns of the industry, to give the Commission some power to look into things, to estimate the level at which the road freight charges might have to be and then to determine the impact of that on the people of Australia. There was a real concern that sufficient time was not being given to investigate those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a concern about the two zones that are being proposed. I remember some time ago when my State Premier, Mr Goss, in a blaze of publicity and in an attempt to hoodwink the people of Queensland, came back as the tough boy from one of these Premiers Conferences and said, `I'm not agreeing to that road freight thing. I have a special deal for Queensland. We are going to have a different say in it. It'll be beaut for Queensland'. Foolishly, I, like a lot of other Queenslanders, thought that sounded like a good idea because we would get some favoured treatment. But, after attending the Committee and hearing the concerns of the people who have investigated it fully and understand it, it is quite obvious that there is a real concern with a two-zonal system. I would not have been aware of that concern if I had not been able to get the in-depth advice and submissions from people in the industry and people who understand what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important that the social and economic impact of the proposed new road user charges are investigated before, or at least at the same time as, recommendations are made for the new charges. The Government seems to have overlooked this. It has quite petulantly refused to allow that to happen. Why a full investigation cannot be allowed and what the Government has to fear from these sorts of things I do not know. However, this is certainly something that I urge honourable senators to consider when voting. I mention very briefly that many of the witnesses had a real concern with clause 20(3) of the agreement between the States, and that related to the possible non-independence of the Commission. I again urge the Government to look at the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also urge the Government, in addressing these issues,  to consider the submissions of the Northern Territory Government and to take on board the concerns of the industry, the concerns of the people who really know how this will affect road transport generally, the concerns about rushing this through without proper and adequate investigation. Those people made a significant effort to come and explain that to us, to point out the flaws in the Bill, to point out what the Parliament should do with the measure. I hope the Senate will take on board those submissions and arguments put to the Committee and adopt the amendment Senator Chapman has moved on behalf of the Liberal and National parties. I urge the Senate to support the amendment and so give the trucking industry in Australia a fair go, a chance to serve the people they look after. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Time is short and I will not take very long speaking to the National Road Transport Commission Bill. I compliment the previous speakers on this side for putting the Opposition's position so clearly and so lucidly. We have a number of concerns about this Bill: the fact that the taxes and charges already being paid are not taken into account, and the whole business of not being able to look at the roads that are provided for the industry to run on and make an assessment of how economically they are being funded and maintained. That is a great disability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk briefly as a primary producer, one of the very few in this Senate, because the Bill has a major impact on rural Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major propositions is that heavy transport will operate on a user pays basis. As all honourable senators would know, I have marked reservations about user pays. It is something that is very glibly trotted out. Very few people seem to understand that there are many ramifications in adopting the user pays concept. It is one of the worst legacies the Whitlam Government left us. If we are to have a user pays doctrine, as I have said on numerous occasions, particularly in relation to aviation, I think there is a good case to get away from personal income tax, because we are paying twice for a lot of things under the user pays concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have a user pays doctrine, I want to be consulted on how my money is expended by government departments. Certainly half the bureaucrats in them I would not feed; I would take them off the payroll. I find that in the aviation field there is very little consultation with me as to what expenditures are run up in my name, and I suspect that it will be much the same with respect to transport. We will have a bureaucratic determination of what the `true cost' is for this service and it will be levied against the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything that goes onto a property and everything that comes off moves by road. It is very much in the national interest that we make that as cheap a service as it is possible for it to be. As Senator Macdonald was saying, that is one of the great benefits of the GST proposal, which cleans out all the on-costs to transport in this country and makes them a deductible business expense. That is why rural Australia has embraced the GST so emphatically. It has been one of the great breakthroughs towards reducing costs that rural Australia has faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties is that most of the people in the Department of Transport and Communications have never been out in the field. There is great concern from these people about how the heavy transports are breaking up the roads. If transports are properly designed they do not break up roads. What happens is that people overload transports, and it is not uncommon, whether they are hauling freight between Sydney and Melbourne or wheat off a property in the Darling Downs, to load those vehicles up to two or even three times their designed all-up weight. When that happens the effect on the road paving is catastrophic and very expensive repairs are required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution to the problem is not to attack the industry and say that operators will be charged $20,000 or $30,000&mdash;some figures are up to $70,000 or $80,000&mdash;a year to register heavy equipment. The correct approach is to enforce, through the State police forces and the traffic authorities, the design loading of the trucks. If that happens, then except in extremes of wet weather, when the paving is undermined to some degree and the stabilisation is reduced, there are no harmful effects to the road surface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall close with those few remarks. I support fully the position of the Opposition on this measure. The move to a National Road Transport Commission has some virtues but, like everything else the Government has done in recent times, it has not been thought through. The Bill is not a coherent document and, as it stands, it will only add very significantly to costs and frustrations in the transport industry, and it will certainly not work in the way the Government intends it to work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of my colleagues have drawn attention to particular problems and concerns with the National Road Transport Commission Bill. My major concern is to draw attention to some of the problems this Bill will cause in my home State of Victoria. Senator Macdonald, Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee have very effectively put to the chamber the very great concerns about the Bill that exist amongst people in the transport industry in their State. These concerns are shared equally by many in the transport industry in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To provide examples of our concern, I draw on a study undertaken by the Shepparton-Kyabram-Rodney Development Corporation. A review was conducted by the National Transport Federation on the effects of this Bill on the transport industry in Shepparton. I believe that the study is important. All through this process the Government has claimed that the changes to road charges that will be determined by the National Road Transport Commission will have a negligible impact on rural and remote areas. This claim by the Government is significant, in the light of the fact that, to my knowledge, no real study on the impact of this Bill has been undertaken by the Government. This is despite the fact that an interim commission has been set up to begin work on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study I referred to by the Shepparton Development Corporation, which based its findings on recommendations from the Government working parties to heads of governments in July 1991, delivers some major findings and raises some very serious questions, which I wish to bring before this chamber. It is significant because it is the first report of this kind to examine the impact of the proposals for road funding by the Government on regional areas in Victoria, and I believe its findings can be applied literally to hundreds of regional centres throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found, among other things, that the road transport industry is vital to the Shepparton region. It found that articulated vehicles play a larger role than the local lighter delivery trucks. In effect, this means that regions such as Shepparton, which rely more heavily on larger vehicles, will be particularly adversely affected. Another finding of the report was&mdash;and I am sure that it can be confirmed by many honourable senators in this chamber&mdash;that the road transport industry operates on very slim margins, around 3 to 4 per cent of turnover, and any further increases in road charges could not be easily absorbed, if they could be absorbed at all, by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is sending a clear message to the Government that its plan to heap additional charges over and above those already incurred by the industry would have a disastrous impact, not just on the road transport industry but on the Shepparton region as a whole. The report goes on to examine closely the financial impact decisions that the proposed National Road Transport Commission may have if the recommendations of the government working parties to the heads of government were adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It found that employment in the Shepparton region directly from the road transport industry amounted to some 1,400 jobs; that some 60 per cent of employment in the region was generated by or heavily reliant on the road transport industry; and that the industry generated a turnover in the region of some $67m. But it is important to recall that the profit margin here is only around 3 or 4 per cent of this total. In other words, the report found that whilst the road transport industry survives on a very low margin, its survival is vital for the Shepparton region as a whole as it generates such a vast amount of income. The National Transport Federation has concluded in its review of the Shepparton Development Corporation's report that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the proponents (of the increases in registration) have not taken significant account of the regional road transport industries and the effects any increase on charges will have on the industry and consequently the regional economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For items that require freighting through various stages of production, the cost increases will be passed on at each stage. Two of the Goulburn Valley's major industries&mdash;dairying and the fruit industry&mdash;fall into this category. They are also staple consumer products and provide valuable export earnings to the Goulburn Valley and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Commenting on the Government's two-tier registration fee proposal, the NTF concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If either a fixed cost registration fee or a variable charge. . . is levied on the industry, virtually all the articulated transport industry in this region will become unviable (given the) marginal return to the operator is (currently) between 3-4%.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is incumbent on the Minister to rise today to respond to these findings. Nothing less than the jobs of hundreds in the Shepparton region alone depends on his response. I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, with your long background in the trade union movement and the very proper concern that you show about levels of unemployment in this country&mdash;and I wish they were shared by the leaders in your Party&mdash;would also be particularly concerned about the adverse impact on jobs that this Bill will certainly have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case the Minister doubts the severity of the situation, he might consider the example provided in the NTF's response to one of Shepparton's largest transport companies. This company operates 65 articulated vehicles. It estimates that the impact of the registration and user charges would be as follows: registration fees would blow out by some $684,125 to the staggering amount of around $936,000; user charges, based on a per kilometre levy of 10c per kilometre, and estimating a yearly distance per vehicle of some 250,000 kilometres, would amount to a charge of $25,000 per vehicle or a total of $1,625,000&mdash;an increase of more than $1.3m over current charges. That is a very heavy burden indeed to be borne by a company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a regional basis, of the companies in the Development Corporation's survey, the new charges would take nearly $3m directly off the bottom line&mdash;and I stress that this is in the Shepparton region alone. Three out of four livestock transporters believe the Government's measures will add costs of $2 per head of stock; hay carting may increase by $10 per tonne; grain freight increases could vary between $1 to $12 per tonne: and freighting stock feed, bagged, up to 30c per tonne. Fruit transporting could increase from $1 to $5 per tonne. That is a very heavy additional burden to be borne by these industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson made it clear at the launch of the Fightback package that reform of the transport industry is of major importance. Yet the coalition believes that any reform must be fair and equitable. The study by the Shepparton Development Corporation raises very serious questions, not only for that region but for the whole of regional Australia, and suggests that the Government's proposals are neither fair nor equitable. The lack of consultation by the Government is of serious concern, and Senator Macdonald drew our attention very effectively to this matter. It is very poor indeed that this Government has rushed through this measure in the hope of giving some credibility to Mr Hawke's much vaunted new federalism foray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's Fightback package details the coalition's commitment to remove all the current taxes applicable in the area before examining the issue of road user charges. The principal initiatives of the visionary Fightback package which would have a positive impact directly on the road transport industry are: firstly, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax; secondly, the abolition of fuel excise duty; and thirdly, the abolition of payroll tax. Fourthly, the package will investigate possible savings to be made by improving the efficiency of road construction and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal concern of the coalition with this Bill is that the NRTC does not have the power, under its terms of reference, to review the existing level of taxation on road transport, nor the need to look at the efficiency of road construction and maintenance. The Government seems quite prepared to put additional charges on road transport, on top of existing taxes. This will increase transport costs and decrease Australia's competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber believe micro-reform is about reducing costs and increasing competitiveness. It is clear that, by bringing before the Senate today proposals for the NRTC which will have the opposite effect to genuine micro-reform, the Government has shown contempt for the road transport industry and has underlined again, as it does ceaselessly with its confused policies, its lack of commitment to real micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I have frequently argued in this chamber that the Australian Democrats, in many of their policies, have adopted an anti-rural approach. If there are any who doubt this claim, I invite them to examine the Democrats' alternative budget brought down by Senator Spindler and never, as far as I am aware, rejected by their current Treasury spokesperson, Senator Kernot. This alternative budget raises over $6.4 billion in additional taxes. They should also examine the Democrats' environmental policies and rural policies, which seem designed in a number of areas to bring much of our primary industry to a grinding halt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that in the Democrats' consideration of this Bill they will support the sensible amendments proposed by my colleague Senator Chapman so that at least some constructive changes can be made to a Bill which, as so many speakers have noted in their contributions to this chamber today, will have such an adverse effect on our transport industry in particular, and the rural sector in general. </PARA>

The question we must ask about this Bill is: is it fair between the States and is it equitable between operators and consumers? I believe that it is not. I believe that it has the potential to force operators to put costs up and lose road transport tasks to the rail system. I am not opposed to the rail system winning tasks by being competitive through improving its act, but I am opposed to its winning tasks or carrying operations by forcing the road transport industry into a situation where it is non-competitive. I believe that the Bill before us, and the one that will be coming before us relating to the rail industry, will not have the potential to maximise the efficiency that is required in our transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transport industry in this country is the artery of the nation. I find it absolutely unacceptable that we have a transport industry in this country which is bedevilled by taxes and charges. The road transport industry is the most highly taxed industry in this country. I want to cover some points concerning that and why, when carrying out the tasks required on behalf of Australian consumers, residents and industry, it is internationallly non-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I want to deal with the current situation. This Bill will lead to a new system of user pays road charging in terms of the agreements that have been put in place between the States and the Commonwealth. For example, a rig costing $257,000 in the first year would cost $38,850&mdash;very close to $40,000&mdash;in wholesale sales tax on a prime mover, trailer and tyres, required to do some 250,000 kilometres. That figure does not include any replacement parts in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further element of the taxes on the road transport industry is import duties. The average import duty on commercial vehicles being brought into this country is of the order of 25 per cent. The national average is around 9 per cent. Once again, in this arena we find that the heavy haulage industry is significantly disadvantaged. Further, currently, fuel excise is in the order of 26c a litre and only 6c a litre of that goes back into the road system. Once again, the road transport system is making an enormous contribution to general revenue to fund other government programs. Of course, this makes our transport industry in Australia very expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to deal with our approach to the road transport industry, as opposed to that of the Government. We are looking at the impact of payroll tax and other taxes that road transport users have to pay, such as licences and State taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our approach, through the Fightback package, is to get rid of the wholesale sales tax and the fuel excise, and the payroll taxes which impact very heavily on transport, particularly in my State of Western Australia, which is very large. The agricultural and mineral industries in particular rely very much on the road transport industry to carry out many of the tasks that are required in shifting products around my State. This applies not only to the agricultural and mining industries, but also to the movement of everybody's goods and services. To have such an important industry&mdash;which, as I said, is the artery of communications in the movement of goods in this country&mdash;so heavily taxed is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to dwell briefly on our amendments currently before the chamber. The first concerns a thorough review of all input taxes and charges paid by the road transport industry. In respect of that amendment, it is absolutely essential, having highlighted some of the taxes and charges which already exist, not to have the threat of another tax or charge on top of them. We have had no clear indication from the Government as to its position on this issue. Will it transfer into general revenue the whole fuel excise that is collected?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill deals with the user pays concept and states  that it is important that the user pays for road usage. I would spell out quite vigorously that the road transport industry is already paying more in taxes than is required for the maintenance and construction of the road system in this country, and the industries of this nation are put at a very significant disadvantage because it is an extra cost that they have to bear. The Government should spell out very clearly its future position, which it has not done. Part (a) of our amendment seeks to establish precisely the taxes and charges and their impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have already been a number of reports on this issue in the transport industry, including the Inter-State Commission report. I believe that the only way to go is to wipe the slate clean, get rid of the taxes I mentioned&mdash;the wholesale sales tax, fuel excise, payroll tax, the training levy and all these existing costs&mdash;and then look at licensing systems charges and fuel charges in the States so that the road transport industry has a very clear indication of what it is looking at. Currently, that situation is not clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to raise concerns part (b) of our amendment, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an investigation of the current level of efficiency of road construction and maintenance practices;</PARA>
<PARA>We know that in this country we have all sorts of problems regarding work practices in many industries. I want to give a couple of examples of the way that road maintenance operates, of which I am fully aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that nobody in this chamber, and very few people in Australia, would not have driven along roads and seen maintenance gangs working on them. The thing that always strikes one is the number of people who are standing around or sitting down alongside a truck&mdash;in other words, not being very usefully engaged in their employment. Occasionally one comes across a road operation where that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to highlight what has happened in the Shire of Ravensthorpe in Western Australia, where I live. It was decided a number of years ago to introduce competition into the operation of road maintenance and various services of the shire. Much of the road work that was being done was contracted out, especially the main tasks. What did we see then? We saw trucks and graders that started early in the morning, worked until late in the evening, worked double shifts and got the job done. We never used to drive past them seeing people standing around with no tasks. We never used to find on a Monday morning that people did not arrive at work until lunchtime and knocked off at Friday lunchtime to go home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of our amendment is also very important because I believe the level of efficiency and productivity demonstrated in the maintenance work on our roads is very poor indeed. Usually, the quality of the construction and the work that is done is quite satisfactory, but the capital for the vehicles, graders, rollers and a whole host of machinery that is used for the maintenance and building of our roads is very poorly applied and utilised. Of course, that is paid for, fundamentally, out of charges that come back onto the road users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out in my earlier comments, the road transport industry is very heavily taxed indeed. The Government should start by having the courage to implement those aspects of the Fightback package&mdash;and the other aspects I referred to&mdash;which remove the wholesale sales tax and other aspects of the charges, including the fuel excise. It should start a clean sheet in terms of charging. In conclusion, an investigation of the efficiency and improvements in efficiency and the utilisation of the capitalisation and work practices must be an integral part of a national road transport system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my colleagues, I am very concerned about the National Road Transport Commission Bill 1991. I have been pleased to hear today the contributions of my colleagues, from both the National Party and the Liberal Party, because I think they have highlighted most of the concerns I have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember that the road transport system employs some 400,000 people around Australia. I am reminded of how important road transport is when I think back to a parliamentary delegation, of which I was a member, which visited the Soviet Union last year. That, too, is a vast country and one of the major reasons it is having so many problems at the moment is that it has a failed transport system. The bureaucracy has failed it; it does not have the infrastructure or the private enterprise system we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe one of the big success stories of our road transport system has been the fact that it is driven by private enterprise. Yet this Bill, which is being forced through this House today with great urgency before Christmas, seeks to set up another bureaucracy. The framework of the Bill is really asking the road transport industry to buy a pig in a poke, because it does not know what it will cost or what the impact will be on the industry and the people of Australia. Here we are today being forced to pass this Bill through the Senate as a matter of urgency, yet we do not know the answers to the issues that will affect every man, woman and child in this country. We do not know what the impact will be on freight costs and all of those other things associated with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, one of the major problems I can see facing the USSR is its failed transport system. I believe this Bill and all of the bureaucracy that goes with it will not improve our system but detract from it. I am not the only one who thinks that. This has also been highlighted by the road transport organisations around Australia. When we look at the proposition that has been put to us today and which we are debating, it is interesting to note that all major groups in the road transport industry have opposed strongly the Special Premiers Conference agreement. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Tasmanian Premier would agree to put Tasmania in the high cost zone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity in this discussion on matters of public interest today to raise certain issues with regard to the administration of the office of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in Tennant Creek. In early September this year, I put on notice with a Senate Estimates committee a question about the performance of the Anyinginyi Health Congress in Tennant Creek. I pursued that matter further in Estimates committee hearings on 12 September and I made a number of points about the need to undertake accountability, auditing and a health performance review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, in early and mid-September, I also had confidential discussions with both the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the chief executive officer of ATSIC in this regard. It concerns me that it took some two months for the inquiry into Anyinginyi to get under way and for the Minister to, in effect, respond to me with the terms of reference of the inquiry in a letter dated 13 November. I have still heard nothing about the results of any inquiries into the matter. I feel that whilst the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has an important, independent and proper function in any of these areas, given the fact that all of these organisations are funded principally by taxpayers' money, the Minister must accept the proper political accountability and give due courtesies and proper reporting in relation to service delivery to Aboriginal people in health areas, such as the Anyinginyi Congress. This issue must be addressed. The procrastination and delays associated with this project, which have gone on now for almost three months, are a major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early November, I raised in the Senate a matter arising from those Estimates committee hearings but which also concerned the misappropriation of more than $1m with regard to the operation of the Jurnkurakurr Out-station Resource Centre, also based in Tennant Creek. It was acknowledged that the events that took place in the several days after that revealed that there was evidence of gross mismanagement and totally inadequate supervision and that, in effect, more than $1m in funds&mdash;which had been dedicated for Aboriginal service delivery purposes&mdash;had dissipated and disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Minister did make available to me an initial report of the inquiry by a firm of chartered accountants, Pannell Kerr Forster, and this then flowed on to the Tennant Creek community, it is a matter of concern that we have not been able to ascertain any further details. I am aware that the ongoing service delivery required by Aboriginal people in the Barkly and Tennant Creek areas of the Northern Territory is of major concern. But it is also of concern to the commercial interests of the traders of Tennant Creek who, in this instance of which I am aware, have been caught for more than $300,000 in debts arising from this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I also called for further information with regard to other ATSIC administered programs, principally certain community development and employment programs, and I highlighted a number of them. ATSIC subsequently reported to me that a couple of the projects had clean sheets, and I acknowledge that, particularly with regard to Robinson River and Lake Nash. However, I have heard nothing further with regard to the problems that are supposed to affect the project at Nicholson River and also with regard to the functions of a housing association at Borroloola and a community service delivery agency in Elliott. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this information has come back, despite representations having been made in this place in early November and also directly to the Minister and to ATSIC. I find it a matter of concern, as we rise now for the summer recess, that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to report through Senator Collins, as ought to have happened in this place, in proper and due time. Therefore, we will not be able, as we properly ought, to ascertain and obtain the information before the end of February 1992, a further three months&mdash;in effect, six months from when the issue was first ascertained. I hope that the Minister will address this matter quickly and promptly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise as a matter of public interest the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's treatment of children's radio programs and specifically the way in which it has dealt with certain educational programs for children. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there are some 2,475,300 children in Australia between the ages of nought and nine years. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio division denies the very existence of these children. Last year the ABC axed its internationally acclaimed children's radio service and took away the right of these children to listen to any radio programs of their own. One could easily imagine the public outcry if, instead, the ABC had axed all of its radio programs for adults. With an annual budget of just over $500m, it is indefensible for the ABC not to allocate funds to restore radio programs for children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently the ABC ran its 8c a day campaign yet again. This means that children up to nine years old are effectively contributing over $72.27m to the ABC, out of which no money is returned to make radio programs for children. It is incomprehensible that the ABC's Board, together with its radio management, is not prepared to allocate any funds to ensure its own future existence. If today's children are not given the opportunity to enjoy and be stimulated by radio, they will never appreciate the value of the ABC or become its future audience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously the ABC had taken positive steps to cater for children by providing radio serials and a 10-minute program for young children called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>. Commenting on the early success of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>, the then Chairman of the ABC, Mr Somervaille, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it brought home to me the absolute necessity to see that our programming for young children, rather novel it seems, goes from success to success.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> brought fun and laughter to thousands of children across Australia, but since the axing of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> the word appears to create terror amongst some ABC executives. They hoped it would go away, but only recently, after being mentioned in a replay of the TV program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PGR</EMPHASIS> on the ABC, they received many inquiries about the program again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In defending its action to axe <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>, the ABC has come up with a barrage of varied excuses. First, those responsible for this decision did not know the duration of the program nor the true cost. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Green Guide</EMPHASIS> quoted Mr Roger Grant, Controller of Radio National, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> costs $1m a year and runs for only seven minutes a day.</PARA>
<PARA>By the next day it had come down to a quarter of a million and he said he was misquoted. But even that figure was misleading and ignored important facts. I am sure that, if the ABC costed other radio programs in the same way, it would find that they were even more expensive to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Managing Director of the ABC, Mr David Hill, gave a unique insight to the ABC by stating that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> was axed because `the program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Offspring</EMPHASIS> wished it to be removed from its program'. Even the listeners were well aware of the attitude of the then presenter towards <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>. Surely there is more accountability for ABC program decisions than axing a program because another program did not want it to follow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Hill then went on to say that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> was not viewed as being central to the mission of Radio National or the charter of the ABC. If children's educational programs were not part of the charter of the ABC, then why has it established such a fine tradition in providing programs for children? David Hill then showed his complete ignorance of radio by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may be assured the needs of preschoolers will not be neglected by the ABC with a discontinuation of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>. ABC Television screens twice each day programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radio and television are completely different media and television cannot replace radio. This excuse also overlooks the fact that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot </EMPHASIS>received many letters from families where the parents had made a conscious decision to encourage their children not to watch television but to listen to the radio, and these children were now denied their own program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responding to further criticism over the axing of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>, David Hill then gave another unbelievable reason when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC charter states that the Corporation is to provide `programs of an educational nature' and it does not specify that these programs are to be for children. A great many programs broadcast by the ABC are educational, and this will continue to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA>What sort of excuse is that? Using Hill's own argument, the ABC should have axed all its popular educational programs for adults, because the charter does not say that the educational programs have to be for adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was no coincidence that once a `Save <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>' concert was organised, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> was taken off air. Despite its being programmed for all of 1990, management altered the program schedule and with one day's notice axed the program. In fact, the ABC completely ignored its young audience and other listeners by not telling them that it had taken the program off air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC action is indefensible. No money was saved by taking the program off air. In fact, four weeks of programs had been produced and have never gone to air and most of the 410 programs produced had already had repeat rights paid for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC continued to cover its tracks over axing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>. After it had mentioned the success of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> for two years in its annual report, why was no mention made of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> in the literacy and education section of last year's annual report to the Minister for Communications? The ABC even took steps to stop the producer of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> receiving a literacy achievement award for outstanding contributions to literacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding to axe <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>, the ABC glossed over the success of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot </EMPHASIS>and the need for children's radio. It was the only non-educational children's radio program in Australia and was widely appreciated across Australia, especially in the country and remote areas, and in preschools, day care centres and schools and at home. Normal audience surveys did not reflect the true audience <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> had. However, two separate surveys by the ABC proved how popular it was and called upon the ABC to extend the duration of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> and to repeat the program. In one survey, it was found that more children listened to each <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> program than watched <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot </EMPHASIS>received more than 25,000 letters and drawings in response to the program, a fact that ABC management has refused to accept. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>In just 12 months, the program established a fan club of more than 5,000 members. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot </EMPHASIS>became so popular that a stage performance <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>was created. Twenty-six sell-out concerts were held in South Australia and Victoria and over 13,000 attended. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>It has also won Australian and international awards, including the gold medal for educational-children's programs at the International Festival of New York in 1989, followed by the bronze award in 1990.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC cannot say that there is no need to provide children's radio programs, because it definitely falls within the objectives of ABC's radio corporate plan 1991-94 to:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ABC makes program decisions based on financial cost without taking into account its overall program responsibility, one must question its program making process. Surely, programs are produced because of their value and need and if any income were generated by the program it would become a bonus for the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When questioned on Radio University 5UV, the Controller of Radio National, Roger Grant, stated, `The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> program earned precisely zero revenue for ABC Radio, but what it earned for ABC Enterprises, I don't know'. But we are talking about the one ABC, where it has been conservatively estimated that products of ABC Enterprises, produced from radio programs by the Children's Unit in South Australia, have generated more than $660,000 income for the ABC. Further income was generated through the sale of episodes of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS> and five children's radio serials to the BBC, and they have a tremendous potential to continue to raise funds for the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much more that could be said about this saga. The ABC's intransigent management has refused to bow to public and press criticism over the axing of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ticklepot</EMPHASIS>. It seems that by their decisions and actions a couple of managers can impose their views and ignore the views of children, parents, politicians, the press and more than 1,300 people who signed petitions calling for the ABC to re-establish children's radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If David Hill is genuinely interested in the welfare of children, other than campaigning against the effect of tobacco advertising on children, why does he not divert some of his energies into re-establishing children's radio to ensure that ABC Radio will always have a future audience? If David Hill continues to allow the ABC to discriminate against children by not providing them with their own radio programs, he has failed in his responsibilities as a managing director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that when the ABC received its budget this year, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, said that the ABC would be free to apply the efficiency dividend to programming expansion and improvement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In raising this issue today, I hope the ABC will not continue to put up a smokescreen of excuses but will take immediate and positive steps to provide children with their own radio programs.

I had the pleasure of visiting the Unit within the last 12 months. I was very impressed with the quality of its work, which I think is unique in many respects. It is certainly not able to be readily achieved by the Department of Social Security in Canberra or in the other capital cities. For that reason the Unit was established in Darwin and allowed to prosper, although, as it would seem, for only a brief period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me most of all about the recent Government announcement is that it is nothing more than a transparent marginal seat election strategy dressed up as a social justice strategy.

That is a great disappointment. </PARA>

As a result, we will presumably get only broad statements made about the benefits to northern Australia that can flow from Senator Richardson's largess, rather than considered, thought-provoking reports. The reports at times have been at odds with the Department but, from discussions I have had, they have been within the bounds of tolerance. Therefore, one can only describe this outcome as politically motivated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another matter which I view even more seriously. It is the establishment of an interim national child-care accreditation council. Senator Tate may have had some involvement in this and if he has&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator will be aware that this matter has been on the Government's agenda since the last election. The Government has wanted to establish an accreditation system as part of the trade-off with the ACTU for allowing fee relief to be extended to the private sector. No bones were made about that; the ACTU was always bitterly opposed to fee relief to the commercial sector, and this was part of the deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has never been any justification provided for accreditation, given that there are regulations operating in each State. Sometimes the regulations vary. For example, the staff to child ratio may vary. It can make a considerable difference. But no-one would argue that one cannot rationalise the system via ministerial councils and the like, or indeed that there is necessarily a need to have uniformity throughout the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accreditation is simply the ultimate self-indulgence. I have been critical of it from the outset, and I was very pleased when Senator Tate, in an Estimates committee hearing towards the end of last year, finally de-linked accreditation from the extension of fee relief to the private sector. There was then some confidence that maybe the Government would rethink its approach to accreditation. Well, it has not; it has gone even further and established what is really a travesty of community involvement and representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all accept in this place that policies should not be made in isolation from the community, that politicians should get out there and consult, and that when there is a need to establish an advisory group it makes good sense to appoint people from the community who have some direct experience of the issues. But what we have here is nothing but a charade. Seventeen people have been appointed to an interim accreditation council, yet only two have had any direct experience in dealing with children. The rest are theorists or unionists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that this is nothing but an attempt to justify dramatic increases in conditions and entitlements for child-care workers and an attempt to pander to the self-delusions of the early childhood lobby, who consistently fail to come up with any credible research to demonstrate that one can show a difference in terms of quality outcomes between children who have had the privilege of having access to formal child-care and those who have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, of course, that fewer than 10 per cent of children under the age of 12 are actually able to be placed in formal child-care centres, including family day care. Quite often it has a lot to do with the cost of the service but the fact remains that it is a small and relatively privileged group that this sort of outfit wants to extend to the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost an ideological obsession. People say with a straight face that child-care is too important to be left to parents. Now we are told by the likes of the people who are on this committee that one cannot put a price on quality. That is an absolute disaster in policy terms. Not only that, but it is an insult to the parents, who are abysmally unrepresented on this committee, and an insult to the consumers, who have virtually no say at all. Certainly the taxpayers' interests are almost totally neglected, with a couple of honourable exceptions. We have on the committee representatives from the Australian Federation of Child-Care Associations and the Federation of Parents of Children in Day Care. Apart from those two groups the rest consist of simply a parade of vested interests. Anne Black, for example, the ACTU child-care officer, is there on the basis that she worked as a nurse before becoming active in the union movement. She became concerned with child-care following the birth of her own children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That can be said about almost every parent in Australia, I would have thought. Yet not only do we find the ACTU child-care officer on board&mdash;and clearly her charter in representing her members is to boost terms and conditions of employment&mdash;but we have also someone put forward as a ministerial nominee by the Lady Gowrie Child Centre in Melbourne who is the immediate past ACTU child-care policy officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear not only that this is one-sided representation but also that it is almost exclusively designed to serve the interests of those who stand to gain from working in the industry or from pontificating about it. I find it disappointing in the extreme, not only because it will not be addressing issues of affordability&mdash;which is absolutely paramount in access to child-care services&mdash;but because it will not even address the real issues of quality. It pretends, based on US experience which I would have thought makes it very clear that one just cannot identify quality because it is such a subjective concept, that the best way to go is to set minimum standards. That is what the State regulations do, by and large. One has inspectors to ensure that they are enforced. One can have random visits, and one can have whistle-blowers; one can have a whole range of people to ensure that children are not neglected, that the child-care workers are carrying out their duties and that there is no exploitation in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, there are very few complaints. Yet we have this persistent push to jack up the rates somehow. That is what it is all about&mdash;to go on arguing for over-award payments and overstaffing of centres. There are some absolutely scandalous examples of the unnecessary employment of people in child-care centres&mdash;almost always community based centres. This is a recession-proof industry. While every other small business in the country either is going broke or is on the verge and is having to cut back&mdash;and doing that in terms of labour, unfortunately&mdash;the child-care sector just pretends that somehow labour is sacrosanct, that it simply cannot address its cost structures, and it puts out its hand for more government assistance. This sort of charade will just perpetuate that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So $1m was set aside in the last Budget to fund a totally unnecessary accreditation system. We are now told in the Wangman report&mdash;which the Government studiously refuses to release to the public because it is obviously terrified that it will be taken to pieces&mdash;that it will cost $1m in the first year alone, and in year 2 probably up to $3m. All this is to fund trips around Australia by 17 self-indulgent pontificators. They will not achieve a single thing. What they hope ultimately to do is to have groups visiting child-care centres and giving them ticks&mdash;giving them star ratings, in effect. One does not have to be very smart to realise that if one goes there on a good day one can make a judgment that will be totally irrelevant; if one goes back a few weeks later there may have been staff turnover or a change in attitude on the part of the director, or turnover in the quality or the types of parents using the service. In other words, it is a self-perpetuating indulgence, for one would need to be constantly doing the rounds and spending as much money as possible&mdash;totally unnecessarily. If there is money to spare in the system, it ought to be going to ensuring that parents have access to affordable and good quality child-care as measured by the regulations. Yet this sort of council will no doubt be pushing for staff-child ratios such as prevail in the smaller States. If we are to bring Victoria and New South Wales into line with those States, it will cost about another $100m. There is not a scintilla of evidence to demonstrate that children are better off between the ages of three and five if they have ratios of 5 : 1 rather than 15 : 1. There is absolutely no evidence that such an outcome will result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge this council to do something worth while, not simply to travel around Australia and waste taxpayers' funds on trying to persuade others that they ought to boost wages and conditions. I challenge it to commission some sensible research to demonstrate that we can measure the quality of child-care by outcomes and not inputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we keep on going down this cul-de-sac, all we will succeed in doing is putting child-care beyond the reach of the very parents that these people profess to be concerned about. It is nothing more than a disaster that there is no sensible consumer representation, that the interests of parents are almost totally neglected, and that this will simply serve the interests of a very small clique. I hope that Minister Staples will come to his senses and will realise that this is an extravagant waste of public resources and that there are much better ways of assisting parents in getting access to child-care services in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer as a matter of public interest to the administration of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I made some remarks last week in relation to the Commission's report, but I want to cover a few more issues which are upsetting, in particular, taxpayers and people who need to deal with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in the outlying States, especially Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received a number of inquiries from constituents about this over the last six or eight months. They seem to be getting more and more terse and it is well and truly time that this Parliament turned its attention towards solving the administration and resource problems of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Select Committee which Senator Sherry chairs is looking into superannuation and that may be a vehicle for looking into the Insurance and Superannuation Commission administration problems. I will be having a look at the circular that Senator Sherry provided to honourable senators earlier this week, which outlined the terms of reference of that inquiry, to see whether they cover the matters I raise today and whether those terms of reference need to be widened or expanded to look into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be more specific about some of the problems which confront taxpayers, particularly in Western Australia in relation to the ISC: first, there is the matter of there not being a representative of the ISC in Western Australia, with the result that my constituents have to try to phone through to the ISC in Melbourne. On many occasions&mdash;and I have also tried to ring just to see whether these constituents are being fair dinkum&mdash;it is impossible to get through for hours and hours if not days at a time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a terrible service. This matter of trying to get through to the ISC to get information about reasonable benefits limits, about interim determinations and determinations on superannuation, was raised at the Estimates Committee by Senator Watson from Tasmania. The ISC there said, in summary, that it was severely under-resourced and that its telephone switchboard was just not able to cope with the load. The ISC reported how many calls it took per day, which was an enormous number. One could only assume that for every call that got through, there were probably five or 10 that did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important and sad thing about this is that under this new system, where the ISC has taken control of the reasonable benefits limit and determinations and interim determinations on superannuation away from the Tax Office, the maladministration and what seems to be an under-resourcing of this Commission are leaving people without the information they require to make sensible decisions about their own provision for superannuation. One of the cases I referred to last week showed that that particular constituent of mine had lost some tens of thousands of dollars because he had been given wrong advice as to when to resign from his position. That is one sad case which has cost that person a lot of money and cost his family a lifestyle they should have been able to enjoy. There are probably many other cases similar to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my first point concerns the lack of access of the Australian taxpayers to this service to which they are entitled. Clearly, there is a need to have officers of the ISC in each of the States and capital cities. Of course, that is a resourcing question and a matter which I ask the Government to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, also in relation to services, the chartered accountant from Abbott MF Cooper and Company who wrote to me has also written to Mr Free, the Minister assisting the Treasurer, and asked him to do something about it. The company has written many letters and has received only one reply in the past 12 months in relation to some of these questions. The Government also seems not to have any policy in relation to the standing of tax agents who make submissions or write letters on behalf of clients to the ISC. Apparently, there is no procedure to recognise tax agents as being able to deal with the Commission, although that is the procedure for people dealing with the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter is that one of this company's clients had received six different determinations in the past year, all of which have been totally incorrect. In other words, they are being overburdened. The value and the quality of their work and the accuracy of their determinations are very questionable. If there are six determinations and not one of them is correct, you really wonder how many people around Australia are getting incorrect determinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, another specific example is that this particular accountancy practice had sought about 41 determinations on behalf of its clients in the past six or so months. Out of those 41 determinations, only one was correct. All the others required alterations. And, of course, as soon as there is an incorrect determination, people have to go back through the process of trying to get through on the phone, trying to get letters responded to, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the constituents' queries that I have been getting, it seems that we have a disastrous administration of this Insurance and Superannuation Commission on our hands. It seems to be under-resourced. It seems to be badly administered. The Government should give close attention to these matters, if it is not doing so already. Clearly, the Government is distracted at the moment with considerations here on Capital Hill, but once those are out of the way, and once we find out who are to be the new Treasurer, Prime Minister and Minister assisting the Prime Minister, this should be one of the first matters that the new Labor Government&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister to whom Senator West refers has seen a copy of HCF's recent health report and the accompanying letter to contributors. To be quite frank, it is a travesty of misrepresentation. It misrepresents all the options being presented for public discussion in the particular issues paper referred to by Senator West. All options that are discussed in that paper aim to extend the overall level of choice available to hospital patients. The question of choice is absolutely paramount. The importance of patients being able to choose their own doctor is emphasised by the National Health Strategy and all options presented enhance choice in this regard. That is exactly what we would anticipate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore a blatant misrepresentation for HCF to claim&mdash;I will use its words&mdash;`that if this strategy were adopted, Canberra could decide not only which doctor would treat you, where you could be treated and when, but even whether you would be treated at all'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Uruguay Round negotiations have reached a very sensitive and important stage, with major discussions and possible conclusions being reached at meetings tomorrow, hopefully. In the second part of the question Senator Panizza asks whether the Government will decline to accept an unfavourable outcome for the Uruguay Round. This Government has been diligent in pursuing the Uruguay Round, particularly in the interests of the primary producers of this country, and levels of agricultural subsidy and protection. Though we have been diligent in that, the question suggests a misunderstanding of Australia's position. We have been diligent in doing that through the Cairns Group, for example.</PARA></TALK.START>

Australia is not quite in the position of saying, `We will accept this' or `We will not accept that'. As Senator Panizza knows, the great vice in the agricultural trade throughout the world is subsidies in Europe and North America.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent third review conference of the Biological Weapons Convention made very real progress towards strengthening the treaty.

There was clarification that the scope of the convention included biological agents relevant to plants and animals, not just human beings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer the three parts of Senator Kernot's question before I make a general statement about the current situation. In respect of the first part of the question, as to the number of passengers, Compass management has advised me that approximately 125,000 passengers have prepaid bookings with Compass over the next six weeks. The majority of those are return bookings;  in other words, Christmas travel. Secondly, yes, it is true that we had a meeting with Compass Airlines which put some requests to the Government. I do not think it is relevant, nor do I think it is proper for Compass, which is a private company, to discuss the details of that meeting. I certainly have no hesitation in saying that the Government will not be purchasing significant blocks of prepaid tickets from any airline, nor will it be providing personal loans to any airline. We deregulated the airline industry deliberately to remove ourselves from that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

Honourable senators in here would know that I have been saying this in Question Time for months. In fact, I think I can probably find one of my answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a week or so ago, when attacking the Opposition's ridiculous aviation policy in its goods and services tax package&mdash;I remind honourable senators it involves dumping large numbers of international flight seats and reducing prices&mdash;I indicated that prices could not possibly get any lower than they are at the moment. I was seriously concerned&mdash;I have been saying this for six months&mdash;about the depth of the discounting that was being offered by the airlines. They were offering seats for significantly less than the cost of producing them. That is a matter for the commercial judgment of the airlines concerned.</PARA>

Regrettably, that dispute resulted in delays in the departure of some Compass flights.

Fortunately that was averted last night by discussions between the airline and representatives of the owners of the aircraft. Compass has advised me that all passengers were carried last night. I might add that we stood ready, through the Federal Airports Corporation management at the airports, to provide emergency assistance in the form of food, sleeping arrangements and so on for passengers, should it have been required. Fortunately, it was not. As I said, Compass is a private company. The responsibility for its operations and, in particular, its passengers resides properly with Compass.

For the record, I repeat once again&mdash;although I do not think there is a need to say it once again&mdash;that I have not misled the Senate in any way. I made two assertions. First, I asserted that Robe River is a rotten employer. I still hold that view; I do not mislead the Senate about the consciousness with which I hold that view. I think it is entirely appropriate for me to be able to make that statement. This Government has not shirked the task of identifying rotten unions when they have arisen. In fact, the Government moved to deregister the BLF, because it thought that the union's activities were beyond the pale, and we did so. I can say, with some degree of respect for the Government's position, that when employers conduct themselves in an anti-social way they, too, should not escape condemnation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I express the sympathy of all members of the Senate to the family of the Aboriginal who died in custody yesterday.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If methods can be found to divert such persons from that type of incarceration, then those methods should be pursued most vigorously. I believe that, as a result of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, those sorts of measures are being undertaken in a very cooperative way by the Commonwealth with the States. In fact, only a couple of days ago the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner, was able to announce funding of some $6.5m for various projects submitted by the States with a view to reducing the incidence of such deaths in custody. Such projects may be simply to do with the design of police cells in some outback areas or provincial cities, as I believe is the case with the New South Wales submission. Others relate to the fundamental social and cultural causes of the incarceration of so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>

That particular prison, because of the regime that operates there&mdash;which relies on the inmates taking responsibility for much of their own care&mdash;is regarded as a model for the way incarceration should occur. I believe that that particular prison, having received that award from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, certainly does provide a model&mdash;not merely for other Australian prisons and police cell situations but also possibly for international significance.

I am aware of guidelines for surveillance in Australia Post and Telecom, and I am aware that the guidelines used by both those enterprises and the guidelines used by Comcare itself have been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. That matter was referred to in one part of the question. The second round of consultative processes with the Privacy Commissioner, I am advised, has recently been completed. The guidelines specific to Australia Post and Telecom include provisions in relation to a code of ethics applicable to investigators.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked whether I recognise the cascading effect of a wholesale sales tax. The answer to that question is, of course, yes. Any business tax that exists is a burden on business. People say that payroll tax is a uniquely Australian burden on business but it is not uniquely Australian. For example, all European employers pay a social services levy which is at least equivalent to the effect of the payroll tax on Australian businesses. Arrangements vary from one country to another with the kinds of taxes which are imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the cascading effect on groceries, I understand Senator Campbell's sensitivity about this because the Opposition's GST taxes necessities for every Australian&mdash;it taxes food; it taxes groceries; it taxes clothing; it taxes footwear; it taxes funerals; it taxes legal services; and it taxes all those things which are burdens on ordinary families in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of AIDEX and soon after it I received a number of questions in the chamber and outside about police actions at the site, as for example from Senator Reynolds. I also met a delegation comprising Senator Childs, Senator Spindler, Senator Vallentine and two representatives of the AIDEX demonstrators. Several of the allegations raised with me concerned purported actions by the police, and I undertook to report to the Senate on those allegations. I have received a report from the chief police officer and have provided a copy of my answer to the relevant senators. Because of its length, I seek leave to incorporate the answer in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ALLEGATIONS OF CERTAIN POLICE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACTIONS AT AIDEX</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An ambulance was prevented from entering the protesters' camp.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police prevented portable toilets from being emptied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police prevented water tanks from being filled. Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superintendent Colin Rowley, AFP Forward Commander at AIDEX, has advised that he is not aware of any incidents involving the prevention of ambulances or any other service vehicles from entering the protesters' camp. At no time were directions given to AFP members to restrict the entry or exit of any vehicle or person to the camping area used by the AIDEX protesters. Furthermore, the AFP, where necessary, assisted those vehicles to gain entry to or exit from the camping site. However, until such time as all specific complaints have been investigated by internal investigation division, the possibility that a member independently exercised a decision to refuse a call for attendance or denied entry cannot be categorically ruled out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ambulance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superintendent John McLaren, ACT Ambulance Service, was present at the AIDEX demonstration and he has advised that he is unaware of any incident where an ambulance was prevented from entering the protesters camp. At the request of the AFP, a unit from the ACT ambulance was placed on standby inside the National Exhibition Centre (NATEX), to treat any person who was injured as a result of the ongoing violent situation. Superintendent McLaren also stationed a second unit outside NATEX, on Northbourne Avenue, to respond to any requests for an ambulance by protesters. He had instructed this ambulance not to enter the camp without obtaining his express approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ambulance on Northbourne Avenue was utilised on approximately four occasions. On one occasion, the unit was approached by protesters with a request that it enter the camp and examine a protester who was ill. The ambulance officers manning the unit advised the protesters that they could only enter the camp with Superintendent McLaren's permission. This was duly obtained, the ambulance entered the camp site, and one person was conveyed to hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the AIDEX demonstrations a number of hoax calls for ambulances were received. As a result, Superintendent McLaren asked that callers place their requests for ambulances through police operations. This action reduced the number of hoax calls being received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT ambulance service was not at any time under AFP control. Superintendent McLaren, OIC Ambulance Service at AIDEX, made his own assessments as to whether or not a unit should attend at the camp site, and never, at any time, refused a call for attendance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Portable toilets</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFP inquiries have established that five portable toilets were hired by the protesters from GKN Rentals at Fyshwick. A pump out service was also ordered for 27 November 1991, and a refill of water and service of the portable toilets on 28 November 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statements obtained from employees of GKN Rentals disclose that on 26 November 1991, five portable toilets were emptied. On 28 November 1991, five toilets were serviced but the employee decided not to empty these as the units were only partially full. The toilets were to be returned the following day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both employees have stated that at no time was their access to the toilets impeded by anyone and in fact, they were assisted by the AFP to leave due to the crowds located at the exit location.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drinking water</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFP inquiries have been unable to ascertain from where the water tank used by the protesters was obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Five contractors (four listed and one unlisted) have been contacted by the AFP. These contractors were not involved in the provision of a water tank to the protesters. The Australian National University also has no knowledge concerning the provision of a water tank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP has been unable to contact three contractors (one listed and two unlisted) I am advised that they are not currently in the ACT but engaged on large commercial contractual projects and would almost certainly not be involved with a small job such as the AIDEX demonstration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP suspects that the provision of a water tank to protesters was a private arrangement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the additional information.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an incredible situation. A few minutes before the end of Question Time Senator Crane gave notice to Senator Cook that he intended to move to censure him. He gave notice because it is the proper courtesy which we follow. He gave notice that he was going to censure him for misleading the Senate in answers to questions on 9, 10 and 11 September and 17 October. Senator Crane reminded the Senate today that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has been promising the Senate that he will put down a full statement explaining the answers that he gave, which Senator Crane has constantly said were factually incorrect. He first said he would put that statement down 101 days ago, and on several occasions since he has repeated his promise to put down that statement. He has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It now seems that he has been sitting on that information and did not intend to put it down because Senator Crane again asked him today whether he would do so and all he answered with was another attack reflecting a personal prejudice on this Australian company, Robe River Ltd. That is not relevant at all to the questions that Senator Crane has been asking, which related to whether or not Senator Cook had made errors in fact on a number of occasions in defence of the original brief that he received from the Seamen's Union. So, having been given notice that he was about to be censured, suddenly Senator Cook decided he had no choice other than to put down information that he has been sitting on. That is an incredible way to do business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you also, Mr President, that time and time again Senator Cook from the Government benches has said to Senator Crane, `I dare you to censure me. Come on, go on with it. Censure me if you've got the information'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Put up or shut up. With great patience, Senator Crane has been coming back about once every month and, as an alternative to the Minister, has been saying, `On the face of this evidence, you have misled the Senate. The factual information that you have put before the Senate is wrong. I give you the opportunity to correct the record. Correct the record. Apologise to the company and apologise to the Senate'. But the Minister would not do that. He was hoping that this matter would go away, that Senator Crane would eventually find that it was too much trouble to continue with. He had no intention of putting before the Senate the information that he has now been forced to put before it, because the alternative was that he would have to admit an error and apologise, which he is not prepared to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

He will first peruse the documents that the Minister has belatedly put down. But it is not a good way to do business.

It is interesting on this day, when the new Prime Minister will probably be choosing a new set of Ministers, that the Minister again demonstrates his prejudice and incompetence. This Minister has already been censured by the Senate on two separate occasions. This would have been a third occasion, which is almost unprecedented. It is a poor standard of behaviour from a Minister and an insult to the Senate and Robe River. He still ought to get up and apologise for the way in which he has conducted his business in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on this matter. When I first listened to the answer of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) I was sceptical about its accuracy. I took certain actions to obtain a list of decisions in this matter from the Arbitration Commission, and it will be interesting to compare that list with the Minister's list to see whether they coincide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given the Minister four opportunities in the Senate to make a statement so that the record is correct and accurate. The issue is not whether Robe River or the union is correct but whether the information that was put down in this chamber was accurate and reflected the true situation. That is what it is about. It is absolutely despicable, deceitful and unforgivable that, after again asking the Minister today, he could not set out the information he had until after procedural matters had been dealt with. He did not miss the procedural matters today because he was not aware of what was going on; he missed them because he was down the other end of the chamber talking to the Australian Democrats. That is why he missed them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely despicable that we now have this situation before us. I certainly reserve my right to continue with this matter. I will look with interest at those documents. More than three months ago I gave the Minister the opportunity of making sure that this accusation about a company in Western Australia&mdash;which today he once again criticised&mdash;was right. Perhaps some of that criticism is justified, but that is not the point. The point is that in looking at these issues, there must be even-handedness in the approach of the Minister to his responsibility. In this case there has not been even-handedness in the approach. I believe that the Minister today, in bringing in that information after Question Time and putting it on the table, has denigrated Question Time and the processes of this chamber. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Industrial Relations)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (3.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say a couple of things on this issue by way of threshold remarks before I go to the substance of it. The first is an allegation by Senator Hill&mdash;he repeated it a couple of times&mdash;that I had no intention of correcting the record. On the many occasions that I have been asked questions on this matter, I have on almost all of them, except for today because I got sick of needless repetition, said that I would correct the record in due course. This is not a matter of great substance&mdash;it is certainly not a matter high on my list of priorities&mdash;because nothing in the record derogates from the two conclusions that are the central propositions of my case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central propositions of my case are, firstly, that Robe River is a rotten employer and, secondly, that Robe River is a vexatious litigant on matters of industrial relations. Nothing here that is now before the Senate derogates in any way from those contentions. I believe that what is now on the record of the Senate supports them strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the point, though, that I had no intention of correcting the record, I did have an intention. I would have fulfilled it by speaking, as it was in my mind to do, in an adjournment debate so that I could take the time to go through the record case by case. I would have spoken on the adjournment because I need a full half hour and I did not wish to detain the Senate by dealing with these allegations during the consideration of business. It is wrong and reprehensible for any backbencher to rise and make an allegation, no matter how well- or ill-founded, and then expect the whole ship of government to stop so that some allegation can be dealt with. So it was my intention to speak in an adjournment debate and not detain the business of the Senate and the normal conduct of that business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that there are a number of cases involved. Indeed, for anyone to make the allegation as I have&mdash;an allegation by which I stand&mdash;that a particular company is a vexatious litigant requires a history of litigation, and there is. A whole number of cases have gone through the Byzantine coils of appeal at various levels of the Industrial Relations Commission and the courts in this country. There have been different outcomes at different levels of appeal. In order to establish a factual outcome on the record based on what occurred is by no means a short matter; it is a long matter and requires clearly set out documentation. I have not proceeded thus far with an adjournment speech to do this, but it is still my clear intention to do so. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to do it tonight because I happen to have some other things to worry about. This is not the highest matter on my list of priorities, but it will be dealt with. As to the first question raised by Senator Hill that I had no intention of correcting the record, I make those comments as commitments to the Senate which I will fulfil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is this allegation of misleading the Senate. Senator Crane obviously got his name in the newspaper by making an allegation. I happen to take my responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown in this country seriously. The allegation of misleading is a formal allegation in the Westminster system that carries with it considerable penalty for anyone who does it. I do not think that it is one that simply should be traded freely across the chamber by way of interjection or allegation unless there is some substantial weight to it and unless people are prepared to act on their words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that Senator Crane is now prepared to act on his words because, as Senator Hill has said, I have certainly invited him to do so. I am pleased that he has now brought this matter to this point. Maybe we can resolve this matter one way or another; if not now&mdash;it is probably not appropriate that it be done now&mdash;then certainly some time soon during the next sitting period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My two essential contentions here are: firstly, that Robe River is a rotten company; and, secondly, that Robe River is a vexatious litigant. In relation to the first point, my reasons for making that assertion are very many in number. The examples of why I have come to that conclusion are&mdash;if not picturesque&mdash;examples of a company taking an attitude about its work force which I think is frankly reprehensible. I hold to that assertion and I continue to make that assertion, irrespective of anything that might have come to pass from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I have not come to that conclusion because a union has asked me to come to that conclusion, or because the Seamens Union, which is the aggrieved party here, has asked me to. I come to that conclusion independently of it, based on a survey of all of the evidence. This Government has reserved the right to criticise unions and take actions against unions. There are two examples of this. We regarded the Builders Labourers Federation as a reprehensible organisation which behaved itself in a disgraceful and unlawful way. We deregistered that union by legislation on two occasions. We believed the AFAP&mdash;the pilots federation&mdash;behaved in an improper way in an industrial matter, in terms of the pilots dispute two years ago, and, as a government, we took action against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a government&mdash;as opposed to an opposition&mdash;has a responsibility to be fair and even-handed. If it is dishing out punishment on one side when on the other side of the industrial relations fence there is misbehaviour, it is bound in all conscience to speak out and identify that as unacceptable behaviour. That is what I have done in the Robe case and the particular evidence that I have adduced is now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter, about a vexatious litigant, goes to the extent to which the company has used the law to evade responsibility. There is a question of law and justice here. The law can be used by smart lawyers to delay the application of justice. Where the law, by resort to technical means, is used in such a way, it can in fact delay a proper outcome. I believe that to be so in this particular case, and I think the record supports me. The record supports what is not only my view but what would also be the view of any fair, independent person inspecting the record impartially in order to come to a similar conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore conclude my remarks on the point that the Senate take note of my answer. If the Senate is of a mind to debate&mdash;and in some respects, I look forward to this debate&mdash;the merit of those claims and go to the facts and the detail, I am happy, in fact not only happy but also dripping with anticipation, to do that. But I do not think it is an appropriate thing to do today. Should the Senate be of that mind, I will be delighted to oblige by making a fuller explanation in an adjournment speech early in the next sitting period. </PARA>

<PARA>In the first place, I note that the annual report for 1991 of the Economic Planning Advisory Council contains a comment which I would like to draw to the Senate's attention. That is the comment that the director in 1991 was Mr Fred Argy, OBE, and that Mr Argy retired in September 1991 after serving for five years in the position. I know I am reflecting the views of all members of the Opposition when I say we would like to place on record our appreciation of his work in that role and, as Opposition members, we acknowledge his contribution to EPAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is disappointing that this slim volume, which is simply a report of proceedings and does not involve any detailed or substantial accounting requirements or anything like that, has only come into this chamber on our last day of sitting late in December, for a year that ended in June. This simply is not good enough. EPAC could perhaps look to its own forecasting of its timing and presentation of annual reports when it is looking at other weighty matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though EPAC's role is to advise the Government on a whole range of economic matters, it cannot be blamed for the mess that this Government has got us into.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that with the variety of expert advice available to the Government, it should not have made the incredible mess of the economy that took place under Mr Keating's careful stewardship, when he engineered the recession we had to have which produced one million unemployed, with the prospects of even greater increases in the level of unemployment in the new year.

I join my colleague Senator Baume in words of congratulations to Fred Argy for the work that he did as the Director of EPAC over a period of five years prior to his retirement from that position two or three months ago. I am glad to see that the Government has since appointed Mr Argy to other duties within the public sector. He is a man of great experience, he is a very good economist and has made a major contribution over many years to economic thinking in Australia within the public sector. I have known him for many years and have had the pleasure of being a working colleague of his for many years. I am glad to see that he will be continuing to make a contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EPAC annual report is, as Senator Baume said, a fairly skinny document. That is one of the criticisms I have of it. One of the favourable comments I have about it is that EPAC is one of the nine major bodies which conduct research and advise the Government on economic policy. The taxpayers spend about $130m each year on the Government's economic research and advisory bodies, the largest of which is the Industry Commission. There are other very large ones, including ABARE. Of that $130m, the cost of running EPAC last year was pretty small; it cost $1.86m. That compares with the Industry Commission at $15.3m; ABARE, $15.3m; the Resource Assessment Commission, $6.2m; the Bureau of Transport Economics, $3.9m; and the BIE, $2.5m. When one looks at the reports that EPAC publishes, one would have to say that it is a cost efficient organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a growth in government advisory and policy bodies, particularly in the area of the economy generally and industry policy. They have grown like Topsy over the years; $130m is a lot of taxpayers' money to be spending on these organisations. In the coalition's Fightback proposals we have announced that in government we would undertake a major review and streamlining of those bodies so that we could get better value for taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a much greater scope for the Government to contract out research work rather than do it in-house to the extent that it is now done. EPAC is a good example of the use of outside consultants and the contracting out that we think ought to be done more than it is now. Appendix 3 of the report lists the consultants that were used in 1990-91. It is an impressive range of consultants. The prices charged by them seem to me to be fairly reasonable for what was obtained and the work that has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 6 of the report lists the work of the Council in 1990-91. It shows some of the major items that have been looked at by EPAC in that 12 months: investment and savings, inflation, competitiveness and productivity are amongst the most important. It is regrettable that the Government has not taken more account of the advice provided in those documents because they are very supportive of the need for greater competition, greater competitiveness, greater productivity, more control of inflation and a more balanced approach to economic policy&mdash;all the things that the coalition is saying need to be done and which are contained in our Fightback proposals. They are all things which this Government has been very bad at. They are the reasons why, to a large degree, we have the amount of concern and despair in the economy that we have today. </PARA>

<PARA>The annual report of the Treasury for 1990-91 is fairly comprehensive. It gives an interesting commentary on economic conditions during the 12-month period. There is much in this report that warrants very careful study and consideration. In five minutes it is impossible even to scratch at the surface of that report. I will just make a few comments in relation to the Treasury and its role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I join in the tributes that have been made to Dr Chris Higgins, who was the Secretary to the Treasury for the first six months of 1990-91, prior to his very sudden tragic death almost exactly a year ago. I am pleased to see that the first page of the report pays tribute to the work of Chris Higgins, who was an outstanding public servant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury has suffered from the fact that it has had no fewer than three Treasurers in the past seven months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My betting would be Mr Dawkins. I think Mr Keating owes him a lot of favours from the past and Mr Dawkins is obviously desperately anxious to be the new Treasurer. God help Australia if that happens. Mr Dawkins would probably be amongst the most unreconstructed socialists and expansionist Keynesians in Federal Parliament when it comes to economic policy. I believe we will have an even greater problem with Mr Dawkins as Treasurer in the incoming Keating Government than we have at the moment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to assess and develop better organisational practices.</PARA>
<PARA>So far as the first objective is concerned&mdash;providing high quality policy advice to the Treasurer&mdash;it is not clear from the annual report the extent to which that was done. Looking at the performance of the economy over 1990-91, if that performance resulted from the Government acting on the advice provided to it by the Treasury, one would have to say that the Treasury was an absolute disaster in 1990-91. I do not necessarily say that because I think the Government did not on all occasions act on the advice of the Treasury and, indeed, on some important occasions acted contrary to that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result is that, in 1990-91 and since, we have had the build-up of the deepest, most cruel, most protracted recession in this country for 60 years. It is a recession that was deliberately engineered. It did not happen because of external factors impinging on Australia. It was a totally home grown recession which has left almost one million people officially unemployed and another half million-plus underemployed and unable to find the amount of work necessary to provide a satisfactory working situation. One and a half million people in Australia are either unemployed or underemployed as a result of the very deliberate policy decisions of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senator Short in commending the Treasury for including at the commencement of the annual report a tribute to Dr Chris Higgins, the Secretary to the Treasury, who died so tragically a year ago. I also commend the Treasury for pointing out in its quiet way why the Government has, in its view, gone off the rails economically. Page 3 of the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1990-91 the Australian economy was in recession. Through a combination of factors&mdash;some domestic, some international&mdash;the recession proved to be deeper than expected both here and in a number of other countries. Not least amongst the reasons for this in Australia was the unwinding of what had been the sharpest asset price boom since at least WWII and possibly longer.</PARA>
<PARA>We can see the reason for the price boom. It was a set of political responses in terms of monetary policy that this Government undertook at an absolutely inappropriate time, which fuelled that boom and which we warned about at the time. Senator Short was in the forefront of the sensible commentators pointing out that the Government's policy approach was absolutely dreadful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 4 the report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sharp deflation of asset prices led to business failures which resulted in several financial institutions experiencing a marked increase in the doubtful and non-performing assets in their portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA>There is not a mention of the huge increases in interest rates which were forced on financial managers in Australia. The failure to use fiscal policy was the reason for this collapse. It was pure, simple, uncomplicated governmental incompetence that resulted in this excessive reliance on interest rates to resolve problems that should properly have been dealt with by other financial measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am having to rush through this in five minutes;  it is one of the 41 reports we have to deal with in half an hour, but it happens to be a very important one. However, another point is made in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession weakened the Commonwealth Budget. While the cyclical effects have been allowed to take their course, the policy challenge has been to protect the structural position of the Budget so that the underlying integrity of fiscal policy remained intact.</PARA>
<PARA>What is happening to that underlying integrity now?  We are getting statements from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that something will have to be done because economic growth is not as hoped for. There is a clear indication coming from this Government that that `underlying integrity of fiscal policy' will be destroyed by a desperate government which is panicking into finding ways of softening the blow to the one million unemployed Australians in the recession that was engineered by the former Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice that the Treasury glosses over the $6.2 billion mistake made in the last Budget&mdash;the biggest ever budgeting mistake, to my knowledge, in Australia's history. A forecast $8.2 billion surplus ended up at $1.9 billion, missing its target by $6.2 billion. In dollar terms, nothing approaches that level of error. In the annual report I notice that the Treasury does not mention that;  it simply says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The. . . surplus fell from $8.0 billion . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">.    .    .    .</PARA>

<PARA>Then it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the failure of certain proposals to be passed by Parliament (for example, the proposed sale of the Sydney-Moomba pipeline) . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure the Treasury that the failure to sell the Sydney-Moomba pipeline would not have made a massive dent in the $6.2 billion in that year. I think it is simply a political debating point to try to run that line, particularly when that sale involved a massive breach of contract which I expect would have resulted in some legal action. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The annual report on the Operations of the IMF and World Bank and, indeed, the report we have just deferred consideration of, the annual report on Australia and the World Bank, are very important documents. I hope that the Senate will find time at some point in the not too distant future, when we return next year, to debate more fully these reports and the matters relating to them; namely, Australia's position within the international economic arena. We have had some discussion on that with Senator McMullan in the past. It was arranged that we would try to have such a debate. I would welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reports underscore Australia's links to, dependence on and interdependence with, the world economy. Australia is very heavily in debt to overseas lenders or owners. Our capacity for independent policy adjustment is therefore limited to that extent. If we had had less dependence on overseas debt and overseas equity in recent years, the problems confronting this nation would be very much fewer than they are now. Because we are so heavily indebted to the rest of the world, we now have a dangerous situation. In contrast to 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago, capital, knowledge and people&mdash;in other words, resources generally, particularly financial resources&mdash;are very mobile. They have the ability to move very quickly to the location which is most attractive for investment; equally, they have the ability to move very quickly from that location. The mood against a location can change. It means that Australia is essentially in competition with the rest of the world, not only in the market for goods and services but also, as importantly, in terms of being a favourable investment location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has enormous implications for this Government; it has enormous implications for Australia. It has particular implications in the weeks ahead. In recent days we have seen statements from the Treasurer (Mr Willis), under pressure from the left wing of the Labor Party and of the Government, in an attempt to out-Keating Keating on an interventionist, expansionist, economic policy by the Government. All the indications of recent days suggest that next year we will see a major loosening of an already loose economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Keating is elevated to the prime ministership or&mdash;if he does not make it&mdash;if the Hawke Government feels that it has to bow to the pressures of the Left, we will see ourselves in a very dangerous situation indeed. The first impact of that would be to increase dramatically the current account deficit, which is already running at $17 billion a year and which is costing something like 25c in every export dollar simply to service the debt, let alone repay it. We have an enormous external account problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do the U-turn <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>which is now being indicated by the Government, the problems that we already have&mdash;the problems of the 1 1/2 million people, to whom I have just referred, who are underemployed or unemployed in Australia; the problem of falling investment, falling savings and falling production; and unsatisfactory productivity growth&mdash;will be compounded. All of the hurt, all of the hardship of the last couple of years of the deepest recession that we have had in 60 years will be for nought because we will have changed none of the fundamental, underlying problems which are affecting the economy. </PARA>

<PARA>Medibank Private had an overall operating loss of $43.1m in 1990-91. Medibank Private's failure to increase its membership share in the eight years it has had the sole control of the Medicare program is one of the strongest arguments yet against nationalising health care financing in Australia. The fact that the overwhelming majority of Australians have stayed with their own health funds is all the more significant, given the fact that Medibank Private has had a monopoly over Medicare. This has meant that more than 70 per cent of insured people have had to go to a Medicare office to receive their medical benefit payment and then, as an act of free choice, they have gone to a second place&mdash;their own health fund. One should also be reminded that Medibank Private's figures suggest that it has been artificially holding its contribution rates down&mdash;one assumes to maintain market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Macklin report has floated the idea of replacing the existing competitive network of health funds with a single national insurer, presumably the Health Insurance Commission; yet more than 70 per cent of Australians have shown that when they have a choice they do not want their business conducted by a government fund. This is quite obviously because Australians like to have freedom of choice and do not like government trading corporations telling them what they have to do. Clearly, if the Government attempted to embrace the nationalisation proposals which Macklin has put forward, it would be flying in the face of the wishes of more than 70 per cent of the insured population. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to present to the Senate the report of  the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. This is the second report in a series that the Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee is making on Australia's relations with its immediate region. In 1989 the Sub-Committee reported on Australia's Relations with the South Pacific and next year the Sub-Committee expects to complete an inquiry into Australia's relations with Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is by far the most comprehensive and wide ranging inquiry into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea ever undertaken by an Australian parliamentary committee. The recommendations, if adopted, would have the effect of greatly transforming our nation's relations with Papua New Guinea, leading to a substantial broadening and strengthening of those relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inquiries such as these into the basis of a whole relationship are of necessity wide ranging and complex and this inquiry into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea has been a long one, interrupted by the election of May 1990. The terms of reference covered economic issues, including trade, investment and aid; political, strategic, social and cultural issues. Experts and interested parties from all these areas spoke to the Committee in over 18 public hearings conducted all over Australia. The report takes into consideration the often divergent views of its many witnesses and tries to set them into an historical context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report is based on the following overall historical assessment:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea is governed by the fact that we obtained it as a colony in a burst of strategic nervousness just as we ourselves were seeking decolonisation. We were therefore diffident colonisers who governed with casual practicality and who departed with alacrity and too little care. The strategic concern, which motivated the acquisition of the colony in 1883, remains a constant factor in the relationship, coming as it does from our geographic proximity. A lingering sense of responsibility, bred of our rapid departure, governs our commitment to aid. Over the last fifteen years we have developed many formal ties and arrangements. Officially the relationship is given top priority and it has worked smoothly, albeit with questions arising now about the processes involved in aid and defence co-operation. Australia's major concerns are about the effectiveness of our aid in supporting Papua New Guinea's nationbuilding, a process that has slowed, and the instability of Papua New Guinea, evident in the secessionist movement on Bougainville or the political, social and economic disruptions of crime and corruption. Unofficially, at an institutional and personal level, the relationship has been weakened by time. Here, there is scope for strengthening it, for rehumanising it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain issues consumed much of the Committee's attention. These were Australia's position and role as a major aid supplier to Papua New Guinea and the Defence Cooperation Program and the strategic considerations which prompt this program. Furthermore, the problems on Bougainville were of grave concern to the Committee. The Committee believes that these are central issues to the relationship and that they are issues that need to be addressed. In the case of Bougainville, there is a need for urgent resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the current delicate stage of Papua New Guinea's economic and social development, the Committee believes that it would be wrong to withdraw too hastily from our aid obligations in support of PNG. These are obligations that extend from the days of colonial administration and particularly from the failure of successive Australian Governments to prepare Papua New Guinea sufficiently for independence. Low standards of education and health remain as a legacy to that neglect and one that continues to retard Papua New Guinea's development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore believes that Papua New Guinea is in a crucial stage of its development and that the next ten to fifteen years will be vital in seeing the benefits of the rich resources of the country successfully applied to infrastructure and other developments. For this reason the Committee believes that aid must be maintained at nominal levels for the next five years. Furthermore, there should be no automatic formula for the reduction of aid by the year 2005 and only significantly higher than expected returns from resources should alter such an arrangement. Furthermore, no such no changes should occur without adequate consultation with PNG or planning time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received a large number of recommendations urging changes to the Development Cooperation Program. The Government has already initiated some changes but the Committee believes that the current proposals should be modified. The key recommendations on aid are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that budget support should be replaced by program aid, supported where necessary by project aid.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move from budget support to program and project aid should be undertaken as a matter of urgency, commencing in 1993 or as soon as possible thereafter.  During the transition there should be a mix of budget support and program and project aid, with the former being phased out by the end of 1998.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that negotiating projects and programs involves great administrative complexity and absorbs large amounts of scarce, high level managerial capacity, the Committee recognises that there may be delays in the implementation of this recommendation. If that occurs, the total level of aid should be maintained through continuing budget support.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The choice of program areas (designated programs) should be based on sound long term economic and social policies and be determined after close consultation between Australia and Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to explain what we mean by this system of program aid. If aid is to be maintained, it should also be targeted more efficiently to areas of need. Present negotiations seem set to convert the existing budget support into project aid. The Committee does not believe that it is realistic to maintain nominal aid levels and at the same time convert this successfully into projects. Projects have a long lead time, are administratively complex and require high level managerial capacity. The Committee instead supports a system of program aid. Program aid is defined as the funding of a sector such as the education sector with a view to meeting predetermined objectives in a given period of time. It is a form of aid that would have definite goals; that would be monitored each year; that would involve Non-government Organisations; that might encompass projects within the target area; and that would involve long term funding commitment additional to and not a substitute for normal Papua New Guinea funding of the sector in question. The Committee believes that this last factor is most important if there are to be improvements in Papua New Guinea's infrastructure. The process of consultation between the Papua New Guinea and Australian Governments will also be a vital factor in the success of this system, particularly in ensuring that the targets are met and that the process remains within the power of the PNG Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much media attention is given to security issues in Papua New Guinea. The evidence put before the inquiry certainly confirmed that the problem is serious. It is a twofold issue. There is lawlessness and violence in the towns and villages which creates fear and inhibits development and there is the movement on Bougainville for secession, perhaps the most destabilising and intractable problem Papua New Guinea faces. Both these problems have focused attention on the weaknesses within the defence and police forces&mdash;the need for better training, more discipline, an understanding of the need to protect human rights in dealing with civil disorder or disputes. These questions have prompted a review of expenditure on defence generally. The Committee understands the decision of the Papua New Guinea Government to rationalise its expenditure on security through joint training, joint logistics and more cooperative arrangements for the use of personnel. There is the difficulty a small nation has in finding adequate funding for the training and equipment of two separate forces. However, there are dangers in the merging of the two functions of domestic policing and external defence and the Committee believes that these dangers need to be addressed by the Defence Cooperation Program. There is scope within the training offered by Australia for some stress on humanitarian law and civic duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bougainville, in particular, has revealed the problems Papua New Guinea faces in the future &mdash;problems of maintaining national integrity, problems of the recognition and satisfaction of the nationalist aspirations of groups within the country, problems of investment and resource development, problems of land ownership and compensation. The isolation of Bougainville has gone on too long. Too little is known about the real cost in terms of human suffering and loss of life over the last two years. Too little effort seems to have been made to find a solution, to get talks started and to stop the blockade. The Committee believes the Australian Government could and must do more despite the reservations expressed by various witnesses who saw Australian involvement precluded by its defence arrangements and commercial interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also argues strongly that the time has come to pay closer attention to the cultural and social aspects of the relationship which have become sadly neglected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is paradoxical that a neighbour so geographically close to Australia, whose historical connections with Australia have been so vital, should be so little known by the majority of Australians. There is scope for a vast improvement in the cultural, educational and sporting exchanges between the two countries and for the development and `normalisation' of the relationship beyond one tinged by the dependency of aid. In this report the Committee recommends a strengthening of the people to people arrangements and believes that this will have a beneficial effect on both countries. Since World War 11 Australia has discovered the worth of cultural enrichment from the immigration program. Our relationship with Papua New Guinea offers us the opportunity to share in the development of a diverse and dynamic people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, this report recognises the many strengths that exist in the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea&mdash;a formal relationship government to government that rests on regular consultation and review. However, there is scope for an expansion of the informal connections, the educational, cultural and social exchanges. We are urging a wholesale transformation of the aid relationship and many other things. In all there are 56 recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am extremely gratified by the fact that, with the exception of one minor dissent, this report has been unanimously adopted by both the Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee and the full committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, representing all parties. I would strongly urge the Government to move towards implementing the key recommendations as soon as possible. The report contains a large amount of important information about the situation in Papua New Guinea and Australia's responses to it. The efforts of the Secretariat, especially Margaret Swieringa and Judy Middlebrook have been magnificent and I wish to thank them, our consultants, Rowan Callick and Matthew Neuhaus, very much. Finally, let me thank my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee for the many hours they put into this report and for their cooperation in reaching agreement on the critical issues concerning our relationship with our closest neighbour.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was a mere misprint&mdash;an omission from the Order of Business. I simply refer to that fact. Obviously, other senators may not be aware that this matter is coming before us. I make that point because I know that a considerable number of members of parliament are very interested in the issue of Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea. After all, I believe that that is a, if not the, most crucial relationship of all of our foreign affairs interests. I note that, at point 5 on page xxvi, the Committee says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Central to the argument of this report is the view that the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea has weakened over time, especially at the individual level, and that the understanding the people of each country have of the other is not as deep or as thorough as it should be for such close neighbours. It is a cultural trade imbalance. Papua New Guineans know much more of us than we know of them. The fault lies particularly with Australians. Apart from those people whose connections with PNG go back to pre-independence days and the small group of officials who deal with the relationship at an official level, there are few in Australia who know or understand PNG well. Papua New Guinea does not figure in Australian school curricula, there are few cultural, sporting or tourist links and the media in Australia present a narrow and sensationalised view of Papua New Guinea as a violent and disintegrating society.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee says further that it believes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there must be vast improvement in these links from the Australian side.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree entirely. It is a pivotal relationship. It is a relationship which must be worked on, as every successful relationship must be. Constant and consistent attention must be given to it. It is true that the press in Australia does sensationalise the situations that occur in PNG. The image of PNG amongst Australians, therefore, has become somewhat tarnished. That is unfair. It is unfair to the vast majority of Papua New Guineans, to those of us who have a great deal of respect for that nation, and to those of us who regard that nation as of pivotal importance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, but we believe that we have a very important obligation to our nearest neighbour, Papua New Guinea. It is obvious that, on this last day of sitting this year, time does not permit the discussion that this report demands. I have had the report for only a very short while. But I must express some reservations about some matters in the report, because I believe that the Committee has made certain recommendations based on assumptions that were not tested. I think that is unfair and unfortunate. Let me refer to those recommendations which I have just described as unfair and unfortunate. I refer to recommendation 4 on page 41 and to recommendation 10. Those two recommendations, in so far as they refer to family planning, appear to the uninformed reader to be harmless enough. However, there is little or no evidence in the report of the Committee that the Committee questioned the basic premises or adopted a prudent or cautious approach in respect of these matters. For example, recommendation 4 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Australia offer a specific project to the family planning associations of Papua New Guinea in order that they might develop and promote comprehensive services on birth control. This aid could be delivered either through an expansion of current Non-government Organisation (NGO) services or through an AIDAB health project. We should also encourage the United National Family Planning Association to be involved.</PARA>
<PARA>The report does so after having said at paragraph 3.2.4 that a certain group of people whom the Committee indicated it saw in Port Moresby thought that population control needed to be made a priority of government with programs directed at reducing the high maternal and infant mortality rates. The report goes on to say in paragraph 3.2.5:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Already Papua New Guinea has not been able to expand its education system or its employment opportunities at a rate that keeps pace with population growth. Therefore, continued growth in the population at a rate higher than economic growth is potentially very serious. It puts pressure on the land; it stretches the capacity of the education and health systems; it worsens the unemployment situation; and it creates problems of lawlessness in the towns and in the highlands.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that aspect in a moment because it is a ludicrous statement. The assumption made unfairly blames the fertility of the poor women in Papua New Guinea for a whole range of problems, and is a totally untested assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that the Committee appeared to have accepted certain basic premises without having adopted a prudent and cautious approach. Let me give certain examples. Was the Committee aware of the unfortunate track record of UNFPA when it recommended its involvement in future Australian aid activities? Did the Committee examine the question of UNFPA support for the scandalous Depo-Provera based population control program in Papua New Guinea? Did it examine AIDAB's involvement therein? Did it examine AIDAB's involvement together with IPPF&mdash;International Planned Parenting Foundation&mdash;and UNFPA in the process of institutional strengthening of elites in Papua New Guinea to the detriment of the ordinary people of Papua New Guinea?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it did not examine this question of the use of Depo-Provera in Papua New Guinea, why did it not do so? Why is there no mention of it in this report? Here is a drug upon which the UNFPA project is placing great reliance in its population control program in Papua New Guinea. In fact, Depo-Provera accounts for 63.3 per cent of the total funds to be spent on contraceptive purchases for women by UNFPA for the PNG project. This indicates that UNFPA has decided that approximately six out of every 10 `targeted' women will use Depo-Provera. This is despite the fact that Depo-Provera is not recommended in Australia for use. In fact, it is not authorised in Australia for contraceptive purposes. Although it is not approved for use in Australia for contraceptive purposes, presumably it is considered by UNFPA and others as suitable for PNG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a real issue, and why did not the Committee ask questions about that? Does that not smack of some sort of colonial attitude&mdash;that something that is not approved for a particular purpose in Australia can be used as the flagship, as it were, of the population control program funded by UNFPA and supported by AIDAB; our taxpayers' money?  I believe that the Committee should have examined those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the Committee have regard to the possible conflict between the social and religious attitudes of Papua New Guineans and the methods which the family planning bureaucrats attempt to impose on their client states? After all, the Committee quotes at paragraph 1.5.17 from a submission wherein it is stated that `Papua New Guineans are amongst the most religious people on earth. . . ' Yet those who call the tune internationally on population control are pushing women in particular and families into situations which are quite contrary to their cultural and religious convictions. There is no mention of this in the Committee's report. I think that is a failing and should be mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also room for potential conflict in the area of human rights. In recommendation 49 the Committee very sensibly states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian Government should explore ways in which Australian aid to Papua New Guinea might be used to enhance safeguards for human rights protection.</PARA>
<PARA>But it is precisely in the area of family planning that gross violations of human rights can occur. Witness, for example, the gross violations of human rights in this area that occur in China and in a number of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been informed that already in PNG tubal ligations have been performed on women without their full understanding of what was involved and the general irreversible nature of the operation. Why were not questions asked about that? Here we have a situation where internationally driven population control organisations are attempting to impose their view on Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the focus of the report has been on the quick-fix approach of the family planning salesmen from New York, Washington, and now from Canberra, many of whose methods do not accord with local customs, religious or cultural values, while there appears to have been little or no attention given to the genuine needs for better and more widespread medical attention at birth deliveries. That has been the biggest correctable cause of maternal mortality, not the number of children a woman has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to paragraph 3.2.5 which I read earlier. It underlines the fact that already PNG has been unable to expand its education system or employment opportunities at a rate that keeps pace with population growth. It says that continued growth in the population at a rate higher than economic growth is potentially very serious. It puts pressure on the land, stretches the capacity of the education and health systems, worsens the unemployment situation and creates problems of lawlessness in the towns and in the highlands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those assertions are made, but there is not one attempt to back them up or discuss them. I am very disappointed about that because we could be regarded as, and called, colonialists in trying to impose our views of the world on Papua New Guinea. The report talks about pressure on land. People with knowledge of PNG know that it is a fertile land. Properly managed, there need be no pressure on the land. In fact, one of the causes of the downturn in employment is the severe decline in agricultural prices. As the Committee says on page xxvii, point 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In agriculture, however, a sector where most of the population is employed, there has been a severe decline in prices.</PARA>
<PARA>If there is a severe decline in prices, clearly the producers do not have the ability to make the necessary profit which, of course, has an effect on employment. It is not a question of there being too many people. The Committee's report then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even the improvement in productivity that has been achieved in agriculture has not offset this decline in prices, nor has there been a successful movement into value-added manufacturing, linked to commodities.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the thrust should be. I acknowledge that it is being suggested in certain sections of the report that more attention should be given to value adding. It is clear that PNG, as an exporter in the agricultural area, is suffering because of the decline in prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that assertion about increasing pressure on land put in the report? Is the Committee suggesting that PNG is not sufficiently fertile even to meet its own demands in the area of basic commodities?  That is not an argument for the imposition of a dictatorial population control program. Many countries in the world with very large and very prosperous populations do not have sufficient fertile land to produce their own food: for example, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, which make their money in other ways. Why is this assertion about increased pressure on land in the report?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point concerns stretching the capacity of the education and health system. An increased population, of course, does challenge those who are responsible for the delivery of health and education to ensure that those services are indeed delivered. What is the implication here? Is it to say, `Because the population has increased we will not concentrate on making sure that health services and education becomes a priority'? As I indicated before, to overcome the key problem of maternal mortality, far better and more widespread medical attention have to be given at birth deliveries. These are the areas that need to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point made by the Committee is that the population growth is creating problems of lawlessness in the towns and in the highlands. Does this mean that this problem of lawlessness is caused by the increases in population?  I again quote the Committee against itself from page xxvi in point 4:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to the government and people of Papua New Guinea is the level of violence that exists in the country. A tradition of tribal warfare has long existed in the highlands but today `raskol' gangs belie the mischievousness of their name and spread real fear throughout the towns. It is a development that destroys the order and peace of the lives of local inhabitants, mars Papua New Guinea's reputation and threatens seriously to inhibit economic development. Worst of all, it has the potential to infiltrate and corrupt the political process.</PARA>
<PARA>Here the Committee is not saying that violence is a result of increased population growth. It is clearly putting violence in the context of certain gangs adopting mischievous activities and virtually blaming them on old tribal warfare traditions. It will not be overcome by throwing the pill or injecting women with Depo-Provera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that people had a look at some of these assumptions and examined them more thoughtfully, because there are many people who dishonestly peddle these prejudiced notions to serve their own vested interests. Organisations such as UNFPA and IPPF are spending enormous amounts of money indoctrinating people in developing countries with their prejudices. I have proof that it is happening in Papua New Guinea. It would have been interesting for the Committee to obtain some of that proof and ask questions of witnesses as to whether this was their own agenda or whether it was as a result of the indoctrination which has taken place by those with a vested interest. There are many people in those organisations who dishonestly peddle those prejudices, but there are many other well-meaning people who are preyed upon by that type of gravy train elite and who are force-fed that nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does not show that slowing the pace of the population growth will make any difference whatsoever. Let me give an example in my own State. Is the report suggesting that there should be no population growth over the next, say, 15 years? In my State there has been a 10 per cent drop in the number of people between the ages of 0 and 19 in the last 15 years, yet unemployment is going through the roof. We have experienced a drop in the population in that age bracket. Prescribing the pill or injecting women with Depo-Provera is not an answer to unemployment, and certainly the Committee has not said how its recommendation will seriously tackle that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee should not put the blame for the problems in Papua New Guinea, as it has done, on the fertility of the poor women in that country. As I said in a speech that I delivered to AIDAB on 25 July this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enabling the true human development of each individual can be seen as the main objective of society, and therefore of political and economic systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Individuals and families are the core of society. Their well being is therefore central to the political and economic processes which seek to promote development. There is no sound and authentic development of a society unless priority is given to the needs of the individuals and families within that society. To the extent that any action taken is not in the real interests of individuals and families, then it is not contributing to true human development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The totalitarian ideologies of fascist and communist States sought to develop societies at the expense of the rights of individuals and families. They failed to acknowledge that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society with pre-eminent rights and functions. They have been condemned by their victims and by history. Only by respecting the rights and values of the subjects of development can a solid framework for economic and social development assistance be laid.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the assumptions that are made by the Committee for its recommendation in the family planning area reflect a totalitarian ideology. They reflect a situation which could end in the ordinary Papua New Guineans rightly accusing us of cultural imperialism and returning to colonial domination in this particular area. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill represents an important part of the Government's construction industry reform strategy. This is an essential element of the Government's micro-economic reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform and development of the construction industry is vital to the national economy. The construction industry is one of this country's largest industries. It has an annual expenditure in excess of $40 billion, it employs more than 500,000 people and accounts for over 60% of Australia's gross fixed capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's reform strategy is directed at substantial improvements in productivity and efficiency in the industry. Because of the links the construction industry has with other key sectors&mdash;particularly mining, transport and tourism&mdash; reforms achieved in the construction industry will flow on through the economy generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bill is to establish the Construction Industry Reform Agency, which will be the catalyst for change and development in the industry. The Construction Industry Development Council will also be established to be a broad based national consultative and advisory forum for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The construction industry reform strategy was launched by the Prime Minister on 3 December 1991. Its objective is to develop a reliable and internationally competitive industry through real and tangible improvements in performance standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform strategy specifically addresses the significant and intractable problems that have impeded the development of this industry to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strategy is broadly-based, covering workplace reform, industry development and building regulation. The strategy is unique and innovative. It is the first time such a comprehensive national approach has been attempted for the industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of the strategy has been undertaken in consultation with the major parties, in line with this Government's cooperative approach to industrial relations and industry development. In this process it has become apparent that the industry considers that a strong and active role by government is an essential prerequisite to achieving substantial reforms in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has responded by approving a comprehensive industry reform and development strategy. It has also agreed to commit funding of $10.8m over the next 3 1/2 years to facilitate the implementation of the strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government believes the industry itself must make a fundamental contribution to the reform process. Accordingly the Government has sought, at the outset, a genuine commitment on behalf of the parties to the achievement of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of this commitment the industry is being asked to contribute to funding for the strategy through financial and resource contributions. This could possibly include making experienced staff available to the reform agency on secondment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant indication of commitment to the strategy has been the signing of the In-Principle Reform and Development Agreement by the major industry parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The In-Principle Agreement commits the parties to improve the performance of the industry to world class practices and standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It identifies specific areas where improved efficiency and productivity can be achieved. This is to be pursued primarily through the development of performance standards, improved contractual arrangements and related improvements in project management. Priority is given to the need for improvements in training and skill levels for managers, professional staff and workers and to the enhancement of the industry's export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement also commits the parties to rationalisation of industry bodies and industry awards. It contains specific measures to resolve restrictive practices and the incidence of lost time on sites. It gives priority to implementation of award restructuring in particular to the adoption of the proposed new classification structure and associated skill related career paths and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very significant that all major national industry bodies have signed the Agreement, including the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, the MTIA/National Construction Council, the Master Builders'&mdash;Construction and Housing Association of Australia, the Building Owners and Managers Association of Australia and the Building Industry Specialist Contractors Organisation of Australia. Every major national industry trade union, along with the ACTU, have also signed the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the governments of Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have signed, whilst Western Australia is to sign the Agreement on 23 December. It is likely that other governments will sign the Agreement shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an industry that has been characterised by counter-productive conflict and internal dissension, this strategy represents an unparalleled approach to reform. All major stakeholders are committed to its success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is on the basis of this ambitious and comprehensive strategy, together with the overwhelming support of all key sectors of the industry, that the Government now proposes to proceed with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main functions of the Agency will be to promote and implement the reform strategy. The Agency is to have primary responsibility for ensuring that the parties adhere to the commitments contained in the In-Principle Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency will also be responsible for developing an industry code of practice, which is to be the basis for encouraging best practice standards in the industry. The Government has decided that it will commence to apply a code of practice for major Commonwealth public works construction projects from 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The code of practice will contain arrangements for ratings systems for those companies seeking to participate in major construction projects. This will involve the development and implementation of a range of performance standards covering such important areas as quality assurance, research and export performance, financial performance, time performance, safety record and labour relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of this code will be to enhance performance standards and delivery through a transparent and objective process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In carrying out its responsibilities it will be essential for the Agency to liaise closely with the key national industry and union bodies and with State and Territory governments. The proposed Construction Industry Development Council will provide one suitable forum for such consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that reform must, and can, be achieved within the next 2-3 years. It therefore considers that the Agency should only be established for a strictly limited period. This will ensure that the momentum for change is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly the Bill provides that the Agency is to cease operations on 1 July 1995. Because of the urgency to press ahead with these reforms, the Agency has been established on an interim basis pending the enactment of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential to the success of the strategy that the Agency is strongly supported by the industry itself and is able to attract experienced and skilled people from the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill, therefore, constitutes a Board of the Agency that will enable people from the industry who have a proven record, and enjoy a high reputation in the industry, to be appointed to it. It is not intended to establish the Board in a manner that simply represents existing industry bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has announced that Mr Ern Macdonald, former chair of Civil and Civic, is to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill permits the Agency to employ staff, or engage or second people from the industry to undertake specific projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also establishes the Construction Industry Development Council. The Council will constitute an on-going forum for the industry to consider ways of improving its performance and standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that the Council will be chaired jointly by the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for Small Business and Customs, thereby giving Council members direct access to the key Commonwealth Ministers responsible for the reform strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council will advise the Government on issues affecting the industry and will liaise with the Reform Agency and other industry organisations and with State and Territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council's membership will include representatives from all major national industry bodies and unions. To reflect their key role, each State and Territory government is to be represented on the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is confident that the high level of support that has been demonstrated by all sections of the industry for the reform strategy will provide a sound basis for these two new bodies to make significant and durable contributions to the development of this vital industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO 4)  1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes changes to the merits review  system established as part of the major amendments to the Migration Act in 1989. The changes are designed to enhance the position of applicants for review.  The Bill also increases penalties in the Act in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy and makes a number of other minor amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government, in 1989, established a two-tier merits review system of certain decisions under the Migration Act. The first tier is the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO). The second tier is the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) which is an independent external review agency. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs noted in the House of Representatives on 17 April 1991 that the objectives of the review system continue to be achieved. That is to say, the review system provides independent review which is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Further legislative changes have been made to enhance the review system and I refer Honourable Senators to the Migration Amendment Act 1991 which introduced a number of important changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will make two further changes to the review system. Firstly, the Bill will clarify the matters which may be considered by MIRO or the IRT when reviewing an assessment under Section 30 of the Act. Section 30 provides for an applicant for some visas, including concessional family visas, to be given points for certain prescribed factors such as employment qualifications, age, language skills and family relationships. The points awarded for each factor are prescribed in the Migration Regulations. It is a criterion for the grant of these visas that the applicant receive more than a specified number of points when assessed under section 30. At present the Act does not indicate whether MIRO or the IRT are required to consider changes to the Migration Regulations which occur subsequent to the original decision on the application. It is possible that the points awarded for a particular factor may increase or decrease in the period between the original decision and the review stage. The Bill will insert a new section 121A into the Act which will provide that points under section 30 are to be assessed by MIRO and the IRT in accordance with the regulations in force at the time of the original decision. However, if the regulations which are in force at the time of the review will lead to a more favourable outcome for the applicant, those regulations will apply instead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second change to the review system which will be effected by this Bill is a technical amendment to ensure that illegal entrants who may be invited by the IRT to lodge an application for an entry permit under section 121 are not prevented from doing so by section 37. Section 37 is designed to prevent illegal entrants from delaying their departure from Australia by lodging a sequence of applications for entry permits. That section was not intended, contrary to what one construction of the language might indicate, to prevent illegal entrants from lodging an application when invited to do so by a review authority. Section 37 will therefore be amended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the issue of the level of penalties provided for offences created by the Act. Honourable Senators will appreciate that the Migration Act creates a number of criminal offences dealing with such matters as illegal entry to Australia, obstruction of officers, and escaping from custody. In line with the Government's determination to reduce the number of illegal entrants in Australia, the penalties provided in the Act have recently been reviewed. The pecuniary penalties, provided as an alternative to imprisonment, were found to be below the levels now considered appropriate in terms of Commonwealth criminal law policy. That policy is expressed in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 and provides that maximum pecuniary penalties are to be determined in accordance with a formula whereby 6 months of imprisonment equates to three thousand dollars. For example, the offence of escaping from custody in section 171 of the Act currently has a penalty of five thousand dollars or imprisonment for two years or both. These are, of course, the maximum penalties which a court may impose. Under the proposed amendment the penalty set out in the Migration Act will be two years imprisonment. However, application of the formula in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act (three thousand dollars per six months of imprisonment) will increase the maximum pecuniary penalty from five thousand dollars to twelve thousand dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The offences in the Migration Act which will not be subject to the formula in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act are those where no imprisonment option is provided. The majority of those penalties will also be increased to maintain relativity with the penalties derived under section 4B(2). In addition I should mention those offences relating to the arranging of non-genuine relationships for the purpose of securing permanent residence in Australia. Persons who arrange contrived relationships to defeat Australia's migration laws will risk penalties of $100 000 or ten years imprisonment or both. These penalties were introduced recently in the Migration Amendment Act (No 2) 1991 and reflect the need for a more substantial deterrent in this area than would be provided by the application of the section 4B(2) formula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also introduce a number of other less significant, but nonetheless important, amendments to the Migration Act to which I will make brief reference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">References to powers of arrest will be removed from sections 92 and 93 and from a number of related sections to ensure that no confusion arises between the powers under the Act to take persons into what might be termed `migration custody' and the power to arrest persons for criminal offences. Officers who exercise powers under the Migration Act to take persons into custody do so for specific purposes under the Migration Act related to migration processing and/or removal from Australia. Those powers are, therefore, not subject to the restrictions set out in the Crimes Act 1914 which apply to the power to arrest persons for criminal offences. However, to make this distinction absolutely clear the term `arrest' has been removed from a number of sections of the Act and replaced with the term `detain in custody'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now deal with the proposed amendment to section 20 of the Act. Section 20 identifies a number of matters which would result in a person becoming an illegal entrant unless those matters are disclosed in a notice under section 20. For example a person suffering from a prescribed disease or a prescribed physical or mental condition must disclose that fact in a section 20 notice. If a visa or entry permit is subsequently granted to the person who has made the required disclosure that visa or entry permit must be endorsed with a statement that the person is recognised to be a person to whom section 20 applies. In other words a person who has, for example, a prescribed disease, must have that fact acknowledged on their visa or entry permit. The Migration Regulations currently permit the endorsement to be in the form of a code recognisable only by departmental officers. Despite this, the requirement for an endorsement can cause embarrassment or offence to some persons. The proposed amendment will provide that the obligation to endorse the visa or entry permit will be satisfied if the information is recorded in a departmental database.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, a number of other minor technical amendments will be made by the Bill and these are explained adequately in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it is with some sense of occasion that I today bring before the Senate a Bill to implement the Government's foreshadowed reform of product liability. The Bill represents the most significant legislative development in the reform of consumer protection in recent times, continuing this Government's commitment to promote the interests of consumers as part of an efficient economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sorry state of Australia's existing product liability laws has been the subject of reports from the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Industry Commission. All accept that an irresistible case exists for updating and simplifying the existing law. We need a system which promotes economic efficiency and provides justice to victims who suffer loss caused by defective products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Internationally too, the need to make a manufacturer strictly liable for its defective products has been recognised in the development and implementation in the European Community of a Directive on product liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill I bring before the Senate today follows the 1985 EC Product Liability Directive in all important respects. The EC Directive has proven to be a generally acceptable model to both business and community groups, and the introduction in Australia of a regime consistent with the Directive will ensure that no undue impediments to trade are imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the EC Directive appears in fact to be the emerging international standard for product liability legislation. I understand that, in our own region, the Governments of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are also showing a clear interest in introducing legislation based on the Directive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian manufacturers will be required to produce goods which meet these standards for export markets if they are to achieve international competitiveness. I also believe that Australian consumers are entitled to the same level of protection as is available to consumers abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Features of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key features of the Bill are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A manufacturer or importer of goods is to be strictly liable for defects in those goods. Goods are defective when they do not provide the degree of safety which persons generally are  entitled to expect, taking into account all the circumstances including the way the goods were marketed or labelled, and the likely uses to which the goods will be put. This is an objective test: it is the objective knowledge and expectations of the community which determine whether a product is defective, not the subjective knowledge and expectations of the claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A product will not be held to be defective simply because a better, safer product is subsequently put into circulation. This should ensure that the regime does not stifle product development or innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a defect in a product results in someone being killed or injured, or where an individual's personal property is damaged as a result of a defect in goods, the manufacturer or importer is liable to pay compensation for that loss without the need for the person to prove that the manufacturer was negligent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The claimant will have to prove that the product was defective, and that the defect in the product was the cause of the loss. But, as I have said, the claimant will not have to prove negligence. The difficulty in proving negligence is one of the factors identified in existing law which can lead to injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering the evidence before it, the Bill calls for the courts to adopt a common sense approach to the onus of proof upon the claimant, and not to become embroiled in overly legalistic interpretations. If the evidence adduced by the claimant and all the circumstances of the case are such that it is reasonable to infer that loss was caused by a defect in goods, then that inference is to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practical terms, this should mean that where, in the view of the court, the circumstances of the case merit the drawing of the inference, the claimant will not be liable to be struck out or "no cased" on the ground of paucity of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, where the circumstances allow a reasonable inference that the defect caused the injury or damage to be drawn, the question will be a live issue, meriting the adjudication of the court. But, at the end of the day, the question for the court will continue to be: has this plaintiff shown, on the balance of probabilities, that a defect in the product caused the injury or damage?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision should clarify the position for potential claimants in what I would call `common sense claims'&mdash;that is, cases where the basic equity of a plaintiff's claim appeals to the common sense of ordinary Australians&mdash;cases which, to use the vernacular, are entitled to a `fair go'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides a number of defences. Manufacturers will not be liable if they can show that the existence of the defect was incapable of being ascertained by any means (the "state of the art" defence), or where the defect came into existence after the product left the manufacturer's control. A component  manufacturer can escape liability if it can show that the component was only "defective" because of the design, markings, instructions or warnings of the product in which the component was incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The manufacturer will also not be liable where the product was defective only because it complied with a mandatory standard imposed by a government. Where the sole cause of a defect was compliance with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth will be liable to compensate the claimant for the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the EC Directive and the recommendations of the Industry Commission, compensation can be reduced to take account of any acts of the claimant which contributed to the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to take representative actions on behalf of one or more consumers who have a product liability claim. However, the Commission will be required to obtain the prior consent in writing of those claimants who it is to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public Consultation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While product liability has been the subject of a number of public inquiries over the past few years, industry and consumer groups have not had the opportunity to consider and comment on the specific terms of this Bill. I therefore propose to undertake a process of consultation once interested parties have had the opportunity to examine this Bill, and will carefully consider any views put to me. I would encourage all those with an interest in product liability, whether from an industry or consumer perspective, to carefully read this Bill and its supporting materials and to raise with me any of their comments or concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, I want to point out that the Explanatory Memorandum prepared by my Department is somewhat more descriptive of the purpose and effect of the Bill than is normally the case with such documents. It has been prepared to assist and promote informed discussion on the Bill, and I commend it both to the Senate and the public at large as a useful document when considering the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill primarily confers legal rights upon individuals to institute legal proceedings. No direct increase in public expenditure is required to administer the regime. There may be a need to consider increased funding for the Federal Court and the Trade Practices Commission if product liability becomes a significant part of their workload, but this is not likely to occur for some considerable time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may be costs arising from the imposition of Commonwealth liability for products which are defective solely because they complied with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth. The impact of Commonwealth liability for defective standards, however, is not expected to be great.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will ensure that it is the person who was responsible for putting the defective goods into circulation who will be liable to compensate those people who are injured because of the goods. This will benefit the whole community. There will eventually be some increased cost to business as a result of the new law; however, European experience under a very similar regime has shown that this cost will be almost imperceptible in the initial years and very gradual after that. The Bill will also undoubtedly encourage improved design, evaluation and enhanced quality control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (4.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief time that I had before the luncheon adjournment I was pointing out that in dealing with the National Road Transport Commission Bill we must recognise the significant road transport system that we have in Australia that is provided by private enterprise. I drew an analogy with the failed transport system of the USSR, which I observed last year to  be a total shambles. We, on this side of the House, are very concerned about the way that this Bill has been rushed into the Parliament, with no costing and no evidence as to the effects it will have on the transport system in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureaucracy that exists in the USSR seems to be working in a similar way to this particular Bill. The National Road Transport Commission will have at least 21 committees set up by Austroads, a group of all road transport authorities whose work bears directly on the Commission. These committees alone will immediately occupy about 10 per cent of the total staff time available to the Commission. The industry finds it bad enough now keeping up with the bureaucracy, but with another 21 committees it will find it almost impossible to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the National Road Transport Commission will need to act as a secretariat to the Australian Transport Advisory Council, and this may take up to half the Commission's staff time. Serious questions should be asked about the level of bureaucracy that is involved with this Bill. The coalition has certainly endorsed transport reform, but we have always said it must be fair and equitable, and we have persisted with calls for an economic impact study to be carried out before any charges are implemented. The amendment moved by Senator Chapman highlights that. Certainly, it is going to a committee, but it seems to be a question of the horse following the cart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that there has been a lot of comment from the industry. The National Transport Federation has said that the Bill is flawed on technical, democratic and economic grounds, and will lead to results that are contrary to the stated aims of land transport reform. The National Transport Federation is the largest representative organisation of long distance transport in Australia and is a member of the Road Transport Forum, so I think it should know what it is talking about. It said in a comment I read that it supports the reform process as a means of improving the effective freight movement in Australia, and it certainly supports the formation of a commission as an expert body to independently develop a better and fairer regulatory environment to our industry in an ongoing manner. However, it certainly does not support the current terms within the Bill which bind the Commission to the terms of reference and agreements signed by heads of government. There is no need to go into all of that, but I will quote from a statement that the Federation made, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Along with our Federation and the Road Transport Forum, these groups believe that whilst reform is necessary and able to achieve real cost reductions in land transport, the current process is unjustified and will lead to higher costs, which is contrary to the aims of reform and against the interest of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have not done their homework. The Bill and what it will lead to are flawed.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn briefly to the effect the Bill may have on my own State of Tasmania. This morning I noted that Senator Boswell was commenting about the effects he sees the Bill will have on remote Australia. As far as remoteness is concerned, when we are referring to freight, Tasmania is probably the most remote area in Australia. Tasmania has suffered for many years with the problem of shipping in Bass Strait and the like. Of course, there have also been airline strikes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that at the moment a vast majority of our freight comes into the north of the State and has to be transferred south to the capital city. The concerns that have been raised, particularly by Tasmanian operators, are questions of which the Government should take note. The question that comes to mind is: given that Tasmania is already struggling to maintain a viable economy, why is this process being pursued? I mentioned this morning that I am quite concerned at the fact that the Tasmanian Government agreed to place Tasmania in the high charge zone along with Victoria and New South Wales. I would like to know the basis on which this decision was made and what further impact it will have on our crumbling economy. These are some of the questions that should have been answered before this Bill came into this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also query what charges the Government will force particularly on road transport, and possibly cars, from 1 January 1993. Senator Boswell mentioned some figures this morning. He was talking about 45-tonne vehicles having an increased cost of $8,000, moving to $14,000 by 1995. All these added costs come on top of an industry already paying three and a half times the taxes that other businesses in Australia pay. That is quite alarming when we all rely so much on our transport system. We know that the Government started investigating the possibility of increased charges in 1985, but we still do not have the answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A letter was sent to me yesterday from the Secretary of the Tasmanian Truck Owners and Operators Association. I do not intend to read it all. The letter points out one particular difference between trucking in Tasmania and the rest of Australia. Tasmania's cart/carrier licensing system ensures that the remote communities in the State are placed on an equal footing with more populated areas. As you would understand, Mr Deputy President, some country routes tend to be less profitable than principal routes, but the cart/carrier licensing system we have in Tasmania certainly helps to even that out. The Secretary of the Tasmanian Truck Owners and Operators Association said in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Federal Government is successful in dismantling the licensing system in Tasmania and displacing smaller Operators from the Industry, the Country and more remote communities will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some large Transport Operators who generally operate between Ports and use principal routes are promoting excessively high Taxes &amp; Charges with the knowledge that some existing Operators will be forced from the Industry. It is their belief that all increases will be passed on to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have the situation now where this extra charge on transport will cause quite significant increases in freight. We know that the stated intention of the Government is to use this road tax to improve our road system. If the Government had been fair dinkum about the excise it has been taking out of fuel for the last few years by putting that back into the roads where it should have been spent, we certainly would not be in the position we are in now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the chart I have here entitled, `Real Excise Collections and Road Funding', from 1975 through to 1992. The amount spent on road funding is pretty level across the graph, but the excise collected is way above the amount spent. It was said this morning that the amount spent on roads was a bit over $1 billion, yet the Government is receiving between four and a half and five billion dollars in excise collections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know and as has been said by my colleagues, under our Fightback package proposals, fuel excise, wholesale sales tax, tariffs and payroll tax will be removed from the road transport industry and will have a very significant effect on the costs and charges to all Australians. We are about removing fuel taxes; we are about removing wholesale sales taxes; we are about abolishing payroll tax; and we are about getting rid of tariffs. We are not about putting on extra road taxes and charges to make the cost of freight to all Australians more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes without saying that road transport operators, road users and, for that matter, the rail system are overjoyed by our package. They see that our future government is prepared to get rid of the shackles of government taxation on inputs and let them be truly competitive. There is no doubt that under the Fightback proposals road transport will be a big winner. In addition, road funding will not be reduced. That has been made quite clear by our Leader. The package that we are proposing will mean that transport in this country will be cheaper. As a Tasmanian, I am pleased to say to all my Tasmanian constituents that I believe that the State of Tasmania will probably get the best benefit from this particular package. At the present time, many of the shipping companies that travel across Bass Strait are paying quite high fuel excise which increases freight costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this Bill, this pig in a poke, came in here without any costing, without any investigation into the impact that it will have on Australia. For whatever reason&mdash;I do not know&mdash;it is being pushed through this place prior to the Christmas break. Given the belief that the Democrats will support the Government and push this Bill through, a framework will be set up, and I suppose it is anybody's guess the sorts of charges and regulations we will see next year further down the track. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to detain the Senate for long for the simple reason&mdash;and I want to be consistent about this&mdash;that I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that introduced the new procedure referring legislation to standing committees of the Parliament for the alleged purpose of restraining unnecessarily repetitious debate in the chamber. That Committee sat from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m. the following day. All the arguments we have heard here in the chamber this afternoon were exhausted&mdash;I use that word advisedly&mdash;during that previous debate. Indeed, nothing new was added to what we have heard here this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I interpolate that if at the conclusion of my remarks Senator Coulter seeks leave to speak, I will be perfectly happy&mdash;and I am sure that it would be in order&mdash;to give him leave to do so, so that he is not denied that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I was intrigued to hear what has become conventional over the years with National Party politicians. Certainly in every election in which I have campaigned they have run the same line. They are perfectly happy to support, when it is politically necessary to do so, the line that is run in the town by their Liberal colleagues, but they are also perfectly happy to run a totally different line in the bush. We heard an example of that once again this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about it is that in terms of the concerns that were expressed about any increases in road charges by this new national regime, which I might add is a very welcome reform initiative for which the Commonwealth cannot take sole responsibility because we are equal partners in this with the States and the ACT&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should not be disorderly enough to respond to interjections, but on this one I will. The Northern Territory Government has some concerns about what I think Mr Finch described during that Committee as a 5 per cent component&mdash;that was his word&mdash;of the charging, but fully supports and has committed itself to introduce parallel legislation with all other aspects of this package. This package will provide for the first time in our nation's history a national regime of operation for heavy vehicles in this country, which is so vital to our transport sector. It will remove the horrendous commercial inequities and inefficiencies in the operation of road transport that currently exist with trucks having to travel from State to State. As was pointed out by witnesses, departmental officers and myself at that Committee, very significant charges currently apply in the States for trucks that are registered elsewhere but are operating in those States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that the National Party is supporting the GST package. The GST package emphatically, and to a degree about which I protest and disagree with, talks about the unilateral imposition of a user pays system and fully supports it. At the same time&mdash;and I have pointed out this nonsense to the Senate before&mdash;it proposes the removal of fuel excise, which currently funds a significant proportion of those costs. That means by logical implication that if the coalition introduces a true user pays system&mdash;and that is what it says it will do in its GST document&mdash;some other method must be introduced to replace that component of revenue raising for road funding that it will remove. The only way I can see of doing it is by some system of mass distance charging, because the current revenue raiser will be removed with the full support of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that National Party members always support the Liberal coalition line when they are in town and then tell another story to their constituents when they go bush.

Mr Tim Fischer was cruising Queensland and while he was there quite happily committed the coalition to providing $1 billion in additional Federal funding for Queensland roads alone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. So in the space of two days the Leader of the National rump of the coalition had committed his Party to the expenditure of $2 billion while travelling from Queensland to the Northern Territory. I have to put that incident in context. When I was retailing that story to a journalist from the Press Gallery, he said, `Oh, well, I suppose that if it was anyone else but Tim Fischer perhaps it would matter'. I guess that, for accuracy, I would have to agree with that comment. Nevertheless, that is the traditional performance of members of the National Party, previously known as the Country Party. Their behaviour has not changed over the years, and I have grown very used to it. They consistently support their coalition partners in savaging public spending, cutting government services, chopping this off, chopping that off, and then going out to their electorates and promising the world with massive additional Federal Government spending for people in the bush&mdash;never actually delivering it, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. I was also intrigued, in terms of the GST package and the consistency of the Queensland Liberal Party with the Nationals on this issue, to see a number of resolutions passed at the recent State conference of the Liberal Party in Queensland. One resolution fully supported the application of a whopping 15 per cent retail tax on every motel bed, every restaurant meal, every souvenir purchased, every bus trip taken, every tourist package purchased, every trip to Magnetic Island. There would be a 15 per cent tax on the lot. At the same Liberal conference coalition members decried and protested against any further impost of government charges on the important tourist industry for Queensland. They are not particularly consistent, yet we heard the same line run in here by our National Party representatives today in respect of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one general philosophical point concerning the continual sneering references by Opposition speakers during the debate to the great Federal initiatives of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). This is a hobby horse of mine, and I concede it. I was a delegate to two constitutional conventions. I can remember discussing this matter with former Senator Macklin, for whom I had, and still have, enormous respect. We got together at the last conference and both decided that we would never attend another one. Having conceded that constitutional reform to remove these inefficiencies in our transport system would be impossible because of the conservative approach we have to changing our Constitution, this kind of initiative is the only approach we can possibly use to succeed. I must say that to refer continually to it in this disparaging way by public figures who have a responsibility, in my view, to help bring this nation together rather than tear it apart does not do them any credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point because this piece of legislation is not a creature of the Commonwealth Government; nor is it something which the Commonwealth Government is forcing&mdash;or can, under the provisions of the Act, force&mdash;down the throats of reluctant States. It is a legislative framework which incorporates the heads of agreement which was reached between the heads of government of the States, the ACT, the Northern Territory, in principle, with the exception of the charging, and the Commonwealth, in which the Commonwealth is an equal partner. We get one vote on the Ministerial Council, along with the rest. In conclusion, the fundamental point I want to make is that we have had a long debate here this afternoon, which&mdash;Senator Coulter will not be surprised to hear&mdash;was a complete reiteration of the six hours of continuous debate we had about charging at the Committee hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this legislation which is in front of us today has nothing whatever to do with that. It simply sets up the framework for the organisation which will make recommendations, and that is what they are, to the people who actually have the executive responsibility for making a decision: that is, the Ministerial Council, on which the Commonwealth has an equal vote along with the States. The fundamental point which appears to be utterly lost on members of the Opposition&mdash;I think they choose to ignore it&mdash;is that we are not in a better position. Let us take the theoretical example which I gave at the Committee hearing. Should the Commission go berserk&mdash;which it will not&mdash;and propose some horrendous rate of charges which would be iniquitous, inequitable and unfair, any head of government or any representative on that Ministerial Council who has the final decision-making power could not agree with that decision, and it would not proceed in that State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This entire exercise depends&mdash;not simply in its genesis but in its execution&mdash;on continued cooperation between the State governments and the Federal Government. For the first time in our history, we will have a national regime&mdash;I must say it is to the great relief of the entire transport industry&mdash;encompassing our regulatory regime and charging regime for moving freight across this country by road. It was welcomed by the States, quite rightly, and it is welcomed by the Federal Government. But we are equal partners in this enterprise. All this legislation does is set up the organisation that will do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this Senate knows full well, the Government supported happily the initiatives of the Australian Democrats to have further matters referred to the Standing Committee next year. We all know that the actual charging regime must be implemented by law. We know that it will involve separate legislation and regulations, all of which will be debated at length, as they always are, both in the Committee&mdash;and we know it will be referred to the Committee because it was done yesterday&mdash;and again in this chamber. For that reason, having gone over this matter for six hours in committee and knowing that we will go over the actual charging regime again next year both in committee and in the House, I conclude by thanking honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I apologise to other senators for not being in the chamber at the appropriate time. It seems as though there have been quite significant changes to the speakers list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I begin by reflecting on the remarks of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). It seems as though, in dealing with areas like this one, one is damned if one does and damned if one does not. Having been forced away from the ideal of national legislation and towards a cooperative venture between the States, the Opposition is taking exception even to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon we are debating the National Road Transport Commission Bill 1991, which establishes the machinery to implement a national system of road laws for heavy vehicles and to recover&mdash;as the Minister has just said&mdash;the road costs which are presently accruing to the States as a result of the use of the road system by those vehicles. Specifically, the Bill sets up the National Road Transport Commission and the processes by which it has recommended the new laws and charges, and defines the Commission's relationship with the Ministerial Council to which it will give its recommendations, and Federal and State parliaments to which the Council will submit any consequential legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission Bill is the end result of a long process of research, inquiry and consultation, beginning with the report of the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics on road cost recovery, which led to the Inter-State Commission inquiry which recommended that full cost recovery mechanisms be implemented. The report of the now defunct Inter-State Commission was refined by its former chair, Ted Butcher, and was developed further by the Commonwealth-State overarching group on land transport, under the umbrella of the Special Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I interpolate, as the Minister has already done, that I find this position quite inconsistent for the Opposition which extols the virtues of market mechanisms and the extent that markets should be used for the efficient distribution and allocation of resources. The Democrats are also committed to the use of those market mechanisms. The basis of the market mechanism is that the user pays. That is what the Opposition is committed to and that is what it is now objecting to in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also interpolate here with respect to some of what economists call externalities, that these are not being included in this legislation. What is attempted here is simply the recovery of the road damage charges. But of course road transport also incurs considerable other expenses for the community in the form of deaths, injuries and environmental damage&mdash;both in terms of acid emissions which erode buildings and in the form of greenhouse gas emissions. None of those externalities are incorporated into this legislation. So even this legislation does not really look at full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support strongly the principle of road cost recovery. We believe an efficient and environmentally sound transport sector depends, amongst other things, on sending the right price signals to road users. That is why, despite our significant reservations about the detail of the Commonwealth-State agreement contained in this Bill, we have decided to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport contributes about 40 per cent of Australia's emissions of greenhouse gases. If we do not come to grips with the challenge of reducing emissions from this sector, then there is no hope that Australia can meet its target of a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; much less the ultimate goal of a 92 per cent reduction by the middle of next century. This ensures that the natural world&mdash;to say nothing of our children and our grandchildren&mdash;will have to face the impossible task of adapting to never-ending and accelerating climate change. This is a major factor in our support for full cost recovery for road vehicles and the development of an efficient and competitive rail system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have been lobbied intensively by representatives of the road transport industry and rural interest groups who are concerned about the impact of the proposed new charges on transport operators and regions which are heavily dependent upon road transport. They believe the new charges are inequitable because the input taxes and charges on the road transport industry are well above the average for all industry sectors and that raising the level of road charges will hit them with a double whammy. They believe many operators will be driven to the wall, particularly where foreign competition limits their ability to pass on the new charges to their customers. They believe rural communities will suffer serious economic difficulties as transport operators fold and local industries become less viable. The Democrats have not formed an opinion as to whether these claims are accurate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Panizza that, like everyone else in this chamber, we are not transport economists. We have been confronted with conflicting advice from the industry and the Government. We have decided that there is a case to be answered. At a time of recession and great rural hardship we believe that these concerns must be addressed and any corrective measures taken as full cost recovery is set in motion. That is why we have initiated an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure into the regional impacts of full cost recovery and whether the total imposts of taxes and charges on the road transport industry warrant adjustments being made as full cost recovery is implemented. This is not a six-hour inquiry involving a few selected witnesses but a lengthy inquiry involving a full range of people who may be affected by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not support the call by the Opposition for us to join with it in blocking this legislation. It has taken an unnecessary, crude and counter-productive approach. To reject this legislation would be to throw the baby out with the bath water. Not only would the proposed new charges be derailed but so too would the development of uniform national road laws&mdash;in the first instance, for heavy vehicles, and probably and hopefully for light vehicles in the near future. In other words, the Opposition, which claims to be the standard bearer for micro-economic reform, is proposing to block the development of an efficient transport industry. This is sheer irresponsibility on the Opposition's part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Opposition believes in the operation of the market which necessarily involves the user pays principle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition speakers in this debate have expended a great deal of energy in attacking the Democrats over an inability to attend last Wednesday's meeting of the Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee to consider this Bill. I want to put a few facts on the record in relation to this matter. Last Wednesday's meeting was organised at very short notice, having been changed several times in the preceding few days. As should be well known to Committee members, Senator Powell, our transport spokesman, is on compassionate leave and was not able to attend. She had given the carriage of this Bill to me but I had a prior engagement which I felt was very important to honour, as many other senators have had from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the agreement that had been reached between ourselves and the Government to amend the Bill and establish the inquiry meant that last Wednesday's meeting had been made somewhat redundant. We were therefore concerned&mdash;and are still concerned &mdash;that the Opposition had unilaterally invited a large number of witnesses, some of whom travelled a long distance at their own expense, to a meeting which would not achieve any formal outcome. It sat for six hours to achieve what I achieved with them in 10 minutes. It should have been blindingly obvious to the Opposition from our press release of last Tuesday, the day before its meeting, that it would have been much more constructive to hear from its witnesses next year in the context of the inquiry, which has already been agreed to. It nevertheless chose to proceed with its invitations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason we are being attacked by the Opposition is that we have come up with a position which is more constructive and sensible than its position. Our position has won general acceptance in the constituency which the National Party fervently believes is its and its alone. We have pulled the rug from under it and it does not like it. Its response is to look for any excuse to attack the Democrats and try to discredit us in the eyes of the rural community and the road transport industry. It is wasting its breath, and it knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the substance of the Bill. The reason I seek to insert those several paragraphs is quite simply that a lot of hot air on the part of the Opposition has been wasted this afternoon in attacking that Wednesday meeting. The overriding problem is that the Bill is the product of new federalism, something which the Opposition supports. The Democrats accept that a cooperative approach to transport micro-reform is necessary but it also creates very considerable problems. If I can interpolate here, it seems to me that there is a reasonable hope that, while this legislation may achieve a great deal in terms of substance, the working of the legislation may reveal the stupid approach which has been taken through new federalism. Before too long there will be true national legislation in this area, which is the way I believe that this matter should be handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem is that the bulk of the Bill is taken up by a schedule containing the Commonwealth-State agreement. That schedule cannot be amended by this or any State Parliament, which fairly limits parliamentary oversight, something I thought the Opposition would have been concerned about. Either we pass the Bill more or less intact or we throw it out; there is no middle course. This Bill extends the power of the Special Premiers Conference to an unacceptable extent because it is drafted in such a way that amendments to the agreement do not need to be submitted to parliament for approval. This has been identified by the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills as an inappropriate delegation of power. We will be moving an amendment to remove it, which the Government has agreed to support and the Opposition has proposed independently of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement has also pre-empted the work of the Commission by dividing the country into low cost and high cost zones for the purpose of charging. The Australian Democrats believe that those States which have demanded this concession have done so for political reasons, unrelated to cost recovery principles. The proposal for charges to be levied on vehicles travelling between zones will, in all likelihood, prove to be an administrative nightmare. We support the Minister's suggestion that the Commission take a long, hard look at the zonal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been claimed by representatives of the road transport industry that they will be paying for road construction and maintenance performed by inefficient State authorities over which they have no control. The Democrats note that this matter is the subject of a House of Representatives inquiry and that the States have a duty to tackle inefficiencies as road cost recovery is phased in. We have no doubt that the road transport industry will use its very substantial resources to keep the pressure on for reform in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not accept the argument that the Commission is tied to a rigid formula for calculating road charges that makes it unable to develop more equitable processes. The agreement merely sets out an initial method based on the proposed work of the BTCE, the Inter-State Commission and the Special Premiers Conference. We believe that it is entirely appropriate that this be the Commission's starting point and that it not be asked to re-invent the wheel. However, the agreement will allow ample scope for the method to be refined and changed in the light of new information. We would ask the Minister to confirm this. It has been argued that the Commission's terms of reference are too narrow and that it cannot take into account the general environment of taxes and charges in which the road transport industry operates in setting charges for road cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not believe that the Commission can reasonably be asked to make comparisons across industries. That is the role of relevant government departments. We have every reason to believe that the forthcoming inquiry will spur this process along. The Commission's terms of reference have also been criticised for their failure to require consideration of regional impacts of new road charges. Our reading of the agreement suggests that the Commission can examine regional impacts, an interpretation which has been confirmed to us by the Government. Nevertheless, we believe that the Senate inquiry should examine this question to ensure that our consideration of the new charges is well-informed and to allow affected parties to address their concerns directly to their elected representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has expressed the view to us that the inquiry is a legitimate part of the process. The Democrats believe that this Bill is, overall, an important initiative for which the Government deserves credit. We would urge the Government to take the next step and seek the agreement of the States to expand the Commission's role to include the development of a national registration scheme for light vehicles under which fixed registration and third party insurance fees are abolished and instead are recovered as an additional component of fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point here is that members of the Opposition are seeking to remove that excise at the precise time when Australia has a very large and rapidly increasing foreign debt. We are importing $3.11 billion worth of petroleum products, most of which are used for transport, at a time when we are recognising the need to cut down our use of fossil fuels generally, specifically petroleum. </PARA>

We regard the shifting of the fixed costs from car ownership to the usage of those vehicles as sensible.

They have clung desperately to their rights and have abrogated their responsibilities. I can use the trite example that here we are 90 years after Federation and we cannot get six States to agree at what age kids should start school. If we cannot get that on the board, one despairs about the more sophisticated matters that require federalism and a sense of cooperation between the great States and the Territories that make up this country. </PARA>

The amendment that has been moved by the Democrats does not. It lacks strength and it lacks purpose.

So it is quite pathetic now for the Democrats to come in here and move this meaningless second reading amendment which will do nothing for the legislation&mdash;legislation which should be defeated in this chamber. For that reason, the Opposition will not support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues in their opposition to the amendment moved by Senator Coulter. I briefly draw the attention of the Senate to a major issue which I do not think has ever been properly canvassed in this debate, and certainly it is one of the reasons why we are very suspicious of the amendment that Senator Coulter has proposed. I refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Achievable Vision: Alternate Budget Proposals 1991-92</EMPHASIS>, brought down by Senator Spindler on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The Senate may not appreciate this, but in this budget the Australian Democrats are seeking to raise $455m by a one per cent tonne-kilometre charge to be levied on all domestic road freight movements. Senator Coulter pretends that he is a friend of people in the road transport industry and of rural industry, yet in the famous alternative budget that Senator Spindler has brought down the Democrats have a vast range of taxes that will particularly hit the freight industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

If he wants to continue to use fossil fuels, which are running out at a fast rate, then of course he has a point. But that is where Senator Kemp is coming from.

<PARA>The first amendment relates to clause 3 of the Bill 1991 and specifically to the proposed definition of `Agreement', which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . means the agreement made on 30 July 1991 between the Commonwealth, the States and the Australian Capital Territory, a copy of which is set out in the Schedule, or, if that agreement has been amended or affected by another agreement, that agreement as so amended or affected.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . or, if that agreement has been amended or affected by another agreement, that agreement as so amended or affected.</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of this is to require any changes to the agreement to be approved by this Parliament. In other words, if our amendment is accepted by the Committee, the agreement which has already been approved will not be able to be changed without the approval of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment is to clause 8 and has a similar intent. Subclause 8(2) of the Bill reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consent for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e) or (f) is to be given by resolution of the Ministerial Council carried in accordance with the Agreement.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this will retain for this Parliament the power to maintain some control over the functions and powers of the Commission, without those powers and functions simply being conferred by the ministerial council. The Opposition believes it is important that this power be retained for the Commonwealth Parliament. It is with the concern that the Bill as drafted undermines valid powers of this Parliament that these amendments are moved. I commend them to honourable senators. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Government is quite happy with the first of those amendments. In the case of the second amendment, while we recognise that what the Opposition is attempting to do is possible, we also understand that it is unnecessary and an impediment to the efficient operation of the Commission. For that reason, we will oppose the second amendment put by the Opposition. While I am on my feet, and in view of some of the things that were said about our alternative Budget in the second reading debate, I shall read a brief piece from the Opposition's Fightback package where, under land transport, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the longer term responsibility for road funding will be transferred to the National Road Transport Commission and roads will be funded through user charges, as proposed in the current negotiations being undertaken in the context of the Special Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA>I am really puzzled that here we have the Government proposing something that is really right out of the package. While dealing with the Fightback package, I note that on exactly the same page, under aviation, we read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has replaced the two airline policy with a three airline policy; the resulting price reductions are but a forerunner of the potential benefits from full deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of what has been happening today I wonder whether the Opposition wants to reconsider its position there. However, in relation to these amendments, I simply want to indicate that we will support the first of the amendments but not the second. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief, because I have not abandoned all hope yet that we can actually conclude this legislation by 6.30 p.m. The Government will support the first Opposition amendment, and we have indicated that to the Opposition and to the Democrats and, as Senator Coulter has pointed out, the Democrats quite independently were intending to move this way, in any case. Of course, both the Opposition and the Democrats have drawn on the report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, superbly chaired, I might add, by my colleague Senator Barney Cooney, which pointed out its difficulties with this aspect&mdash;and this amendment of course fixes it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be supporting the second amendment. The reason is that paragraphs (e) and (f) of clause 8(1) are intended to merely facilitate the Commission in the performance of its functions, which&mdash;and this is the important point&mdash;are only advisory in nature. The functions and powers that may be conferred by Executive action are limited to those that come within the Executive power of government, such as powers to make inquiries, to form opinions about questions of policy and to make reports or non-binding recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be inappropriate and time-consuming for such actions to be disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, particularly as resultant decisions of the ministerial council will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the normal legislative processes. The amendment proposed is not in the spirit of the cooperative approach encompassed in the decision under the heads of government agreement to establish the Commission. I further add, simply to clarify this matter beyond dispute, and for the benefit of the Democrats who have raised this concern with us: as was explained in the Government's response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the powers that can be referred by Executive action do not include power to compel people to supply information or documents or to make recommendations which have legal effect. These are powers that cannot be conferred on the Commission other than by legislative means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If those opposite cannot do better than that, they want to give up. I am at somewhat of a loss to understand why Senator Panizza would want to ask this question, seeing that he asked precisely the same question in the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, as Senator Chapman can recall. I will now give him precisely the same answer that I gave him in the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the eventuality that only one State was in that position, the option would be available of course to simply proceed with the remaining participants. This entire arrangement is one that is, of necessity, based on political commonsense. If the situation were that the process, for example, irretrievably broke down&mdash;I did make this point at tedious length in the Committee&mdash;the position would have to be politically re-evaluated at the time it happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that Senator Panizza asked this question in the Committee. The reason this is an important point is that it simply reasserts the point I made earlier that this is not a piece of legislation which the Commonwealth Government is shoving down the throats of reluctant States. This is a piece of legislation which reflects precisely the heads of agreement that has been reached between the Commonwealth, the States and the ACT, which are all acting as equal partners in this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has no more vote on the ministerial council than any other State. That is the situation. If, for example, a State determines later that&mdash;and this is the hypothetical situation I put, as Senator Panizza will recall, in the Committee&mdash;the charges are outrageous, it has the complete sovereign right not to participate any further. The remaining members of the council at that point can determine to go on with the arrangement without the State, as currently we are doing without the Northern Territory's agreement to one aspect of the charging regime. It would be a political problem and it would be dealt with politically. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the second and final report on the Committee's inquiry into the business migration program and control of visitor entry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for two reports arose after the inquiry commenced in June 1990. The initial response to the inquiry expressed so much concern about the operation of the business migration program that the Committee decided it would examine that program before looking at matters relating to the control of visitor entry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee presented its report on the business migration program to Parliament in June of this year and then began its examination of control of visitor entry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This inquiry arose from criticisms made by the Auditor-General of visa issue and entry operations administered in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (or DILGEA). The Auditor-General found control weaknesses, procedural breakdowns and systems deficiencies which created a serious inherent risk that entry could be granted to people contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this inquiry, the Committee received 57 submissions and held three public hearings. It also conducted inspections at the entry control point, international terminal, Kingsford Smith Airport, Sydney, and at the Entry Operations Centre in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was aware that the administration of the entry of visitors to Australia is fraught with difficulties. The importance of tourism to the economy, and the legitimate expectations of all Australians that overseas family and friends should be able to enter the country easily as visitors, are important considerations. They must be balanced against the need to prevent the entry of undesirable persons, such as terrorists and criminals, and those who seek to "jump the queue" to enter and remain in Australia illegally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of visitors to Australia has been steadily increasing. Since 1984/85 there has been an average increase of 20% in the number of visitor and temporary entry visas issued each year. In 1990/91 alone, more than 1.48 million visas were issued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DILGEA has developed a range of databases which allow it not only to control entry but also to have accurate knowledge of who is in the country and whether that person is a legal or an illegal entrant. In 1990/91, over 9000 illegal entrants were located; of these, over 4000 had their departures enforced and over 700 were deported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April 1991, it was estimated there were 78,000 illegal entrants in Australia. Although the number of overstayers is small against the overall number of visas issued, it is a matter of concern to the Committee that some of these people, both students and other groups, are involved in serious crime in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that appropriate means have been and are being taken to reduce the number of people who overstay their visa period. It notes that additional resources have been provided in the 1991/92 Budget and has recommended that these resource levels be maintained in real terms to reduce even further the number of overstayers in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is aware that there are legitimate reasons why a person who holds an Australian passport may wish to travel on another passport. However, the Committee believes that Australian citizens should always use their Australian passports when entering or leaving Australia. Therefore, the Committee has recommended amendment to the Migration Act 1958.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the Committee believes it should be an offence under the Act for Australian citizens not to use their Australian passports when entering or leaving the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence given to the Committee highlighted problems which arise when, after the forfeiture of an Australian passport, holders of dual passports could still leave the country. The capacity exists within DILGEA's databases for information to be stored and retrieved on holders of more than one passport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers this information could be used more efficiently than at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the databases maintained by DILGEA and the Australian Customs Service be searched for dual passport holdings, and that an emergency alert be placed on these databases to prevent the departure from Australia of the holder of a surrendered Australian passport leaving on any other passport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Australian citizens apply for Australian passports, they must provide details of citizenship of any other country. The Committee suggests that, before passports are issued, databases maintained by DILGEA and the Australian Customs Service be searched for information on whether applicants hold additional passports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the number of persons entering Australia temporarily and committing serious crimes is small against total numbers of visas issued, the Committee noted that it was not possible to establish actual numbers or the categories by which such persons gained entry. Accordingly, we have recommended the establishment of a working party to establish procedures to measure the extent of this criminal activity. This working party should examine policing problems, the type of criminal activities undertaken, any geographical concentrations and any multi-agency action which should be taken to deal with these activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Immigration Records and Information System, or IRIS, is a database which creates a record of the application for a visa, checks the application against alert lists and prints a visa. IRIS has been developed in two phases and the first version has now been installed in 48 posts overseas which issue 95% of visitor visas. It is expected to be introduced in all posts by the end of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide an effective immigration screen, we believe the remaining high/small volume posts should be equipped with IRIS as a matter of priority. The Committee has recommended that IRIS be installed in all overseas posts as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the efficiency of the migrant alert list would be improved by the establishment of a two-way communications link with overseas posts and have recommended that such a link be established as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Passenger cards are completed by persons entering or leaving Australia and the information provided is used by a number of authorities. We believe these cards serve a useful purpose and have recommended they be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pre-visa assessment is a means of screening applicants for student visas from countries which have a high risk of overstaying those visas. Introduction of this assessment has had a major impact in controlling student entry because it acts as a bona fide test and includes an assessment of financial viability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that pre-visa assessment of applicants for student entry should continue and that a test of financial viability should be one of the criteria for that assessment. We believe it is particularly important that such assessments of students enrolling in non-formal courses be rigorously maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that pre-visa assessment is currently under review by a working party made up of DILGEA and the departments of Employment, Education and Training and Foreign Affairs and Trade. We have recommended that this working party review pre-visa assessment for short, non-formal studies, including the retention of prepayment of fees, introduction of bonds or bank guarantees as a financial viability test in the assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our final recommendation deals with the possible use of asylum provisions in the Migration Act 1958 by persons holding student visas. Statistics on asylum seekers are compiled against the applicant's country of origin, but there is no record of the category of entry by which an applicant entered Australia. The Committee has recommended that statistics on asylum seekers include an analysis of the categories under which they gained entry to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acknowledges that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has been working towards an effective system to control visitor entry. We believe our recommendations will make that system work more efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)notes that the Australian Labor Party has rewarded the architect of the recession and the principal cause of the misery being suffered by 900,000 unemployed Australians and their families with the highest office of Government; and</PARA>

<PARA>It is incredible that the once great Australian Labor Party would reward the architect of the recession with the office of Prime Minister. This person is principally responsible for nearly one million unemployed Australians and all the misery being suffered by them and their families, of another 500,000 who have given up looking for work, and those who are underemployed. A total of 31 per cent of young Australians are unemployed and are looking for work unsuccessfully. It is amazing that the person principally responsible for this shocking state of affairs in this nation would be rewarded by this Government with the office of Prime Minister. It is important, therefore, that this motion be debated tonight because the consequences for Australia are too horrible to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the man who claimed to know it all economically. This was the man who basically designed and claimed credit for the recession. He was the man who said, `This was the recession we had to have'. He was the one who gave us interest rates and inflation rates well beyond those of our competitors. He designed the J curve and all these other exotic economic expressions and basically produced an economic environment which has resulted in so much misery and suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this man get for that achievement? Members of the Labor Party make him Prime Minister. They throw out their successful Prime Minister who won four separate elections and give him the reward of being booted out while still in office. They then put into office the principal architect of the recession, the person responsible for the horrible state of affairs that exists presently in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could that occur? How could these people be so silly? How could they not find a third party if they are sick and tired of Mr Hawke? How could they put Mr Keating before the Australian people as a credible Prime Minister in the light of his economic record and the suffering that he has caused?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this action, we are of the view that today will be known in the history of Australia as a day of shame. It will be known as the day on which the appalling state of the Labor Party was finally recognised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two parts to this motion. The first concerns the rewarding of the architect of the recession with the office of Prime Minister. I find that an interesting phrase for the Senate to be debating tonight. I can recall that a certain Dr Hewson used to give advice to a former government. Those opposite would all recall that government; some of them were members of it. I wonder what happened while he gave advice. He gave the economic advice that gave us double digit inflation, interest rates and unemployment. Dr Hewson made a trifecta. There is no chance whatsoever of that now. But what did those opposite reward him with? They rewarded him with the leadership of their Party. No-one in the Labor Party could even seek to emulate those kinds of achievements. No-one could even bother, and we will not. </PARA>

I think everybody&mdash;except possibly Senator Archer, judging by what he has just said&mdash;would understand that which led you to be concerned about the constant interjections, which quite clearly on this occasion and on other occasions have constituted `persistently and wilfully' obstructing the business of the Senate. In this event, that was someone trying to speak to a motion which some people at least thought was important. The people who were actually interjecting had indicated that they thought it was important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about senators on our side. It seems that Senator Kemp was named tonight because he laughed in an environment where he was more than entitled to laugh. As Senator Kemp said, he had every reason to laugh at the presentation of Senator Richardson and he had every reason to laugh at the behaviour of the Labor Party today. How is laughing disorderly under standing order 203? Is it persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of the Senate? No-one could say that Senator Kemp did that. Is it disorderly conduct? Surely it is not disorderly conduct within the normal meaning of that expression. He certainly did not use objectionable words. He certainly did not wilfully refuse to conform with the Standing Orders. He did not wilfully disregard the authority of the Chair by laughing at Senator Richardson. He was well within what can be fairly expected in a debate of this nature in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the Deputy President lost control. He saw that the only way of getting himself out of that difficulty was to throw someone out. That is not the level of performance that the Senate should be entitled to expect from the Deputy President. As I have said, other circumstances have occurred in recent times where this side of the chamber has been particularly unhappy with the performance of the Deputy President, but we have not moved in this way because it is obviously not a course of action which we would desire to take. Tonight it is beyond all sense of reason. Therefore, we see no alternative but to take this action. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are reaching the end of this session of the Parliament and, of course, there is still business to be considered. Earlier this evening the Opposition sought to contrive, in the absence of any interest in the community outside, a motion to suspend Standing Orders. I think the community would be concerned to see that the Senate completed its business. That is what the community would be concerned about; that is what the community would expect of the Senate tonight. Tonight the Opposition moved a motion to suspend Standing Orders to enable a debate&mdash;in the interests of being seen as politically virile&mdash;concerning the new Prime Minister of this country. That was the issue which was before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that, in relation to that debate and vote in respect of Senator Kemp's exclusion from the chamber, Senator Hill got up and moved that Senator Colston no longer had the confidence of the Senate.

In terms of Senator Colston's ruling, managing a chamber such as this, as Senator Colston was doing, in very difficult circumstances when there is acrimonious debate taking place, is not an easy task. Senator Colston, as Deputy President, is entitled to make judgments about these matters which, unless they are horrendously out of line with the Standing Orders, should be respected by the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have served in this chamber now for almost six years. During that time I have had the opportunity to observe the great degree of difficulty and strain that can attach to presiding over the conduct of this chamber. Former Senator Doug McClelland, your predecessor, Mr President, performed remarkably well, and on this side there was a very high degree of support for and acceptance of his performance. For our own part, we had former Senator Hamer as Deputy President who, again, showed a great deal of sense and discretion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that you, Mr President, have done a very good job in almost every situation that you have been placed in. There are times, of course, when difficulties arise and we will have our disagreements but, by and large, you have demonstrated the flexibility and tolerance that is an essential part of presiding over this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it is with great regret that we have to say that Senator Colston has simply not measured up to that task. On the one hand, he has sought to throw his weight around in such a way that he demeans the office of Deputy President. He brings the chamber into disrepute by rising inappropriately, quite often ahead of time and, as tonight amply demonstrates, with no regard to the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that a person in politics would be acutely sensitive to matters of high drama and, indeed, melodrama. Surely tonight is one such occasion when, for the first time in history, the Labor Party has thrown out not only its most successful leader but also a Prime Minister that it has previously regarded very highly. I cannot imagine a more charged atmosphere. Yet Senator Colston purports to act as though this is just another debate, just another discussion amongst competing forces, and something that does not deserve even to have an exchange of views, an exchange of interjections and an exchange of laughter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those things are part of the give and take in this place&mdash;part and parcel of making democracy work. In almost every instance, the Chair&mdash;you, in particular, Mr President&mdash;has been flexible enough to allow that to happen. The great tragedy of Senator Colston's misrule and the way in which he has presided&mdash;not just on this occasion; it was also amply demonstrated in the way that he reacted with Senator Baume&mdash;was the fact that he overreacted in the first instance and then made a complete fool of himself by backing off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not much honesty at the top in the Democrats, and we have known that for quite some time. That is just part of the side tragedy. The real tragedy is that we have had in this chamber a Deputy President who is clearly incompetent. It gives us no joy to say that, because I think we are all prepared to accept that in the heat of the moment one can make mistakes and that one does need to back off from time to time. I thought that Senator Ray gave a very good example of that tonight. Quite clearly he did not want matters to go in the direction that they did, but there was no conception on the part of the Deputy President that somehow there was a need to resolve the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been quite permissible for him to have invited the Democrats to back off or to have somehow accepted the explanation given by Senator Kemp. But we had a succession of errors on the part of the Deputy President: not even beginning to comprehend that a senator is entitled to natural justice and is entitled to know on what basis he has been warned and then named; demanding that somehow Senator Kemp had to give an apology when clearly the Standing Orders do not require that; not really heeding the explanation given and not being prepared to accept that there were circumstances that would justify overlooking any minor misdemeanour, which is about as high as one could possibly place it; and, again, singling out someone who, from where I sat, committed no greater offence than probably half of this chamber has done tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it is such a sad state of affairs. The Deputy President does not have the confidence of the chamber when suddenly someone is singled out for behaviour that almost everyone else would regard as fair and reasonable in the fairly highly charged circumstances of the night. That is where judgment is required. That is where discretion is required. Senator Colston manifestly lacks both of those qualities. He has been given an opportunity over a long period to demonstrate that he can learn on the job, that he can use tact and discretion and that he can familiarise himself with Standing Orders. But what we have found time and again is that he has no understanding of Standing Orders&mdash;he constantly has to have them explained to him by the Clerk&mdash;and generally he demonstrates an inability to handle the affairs of the chamber. That is a very sad state of affairs, and that is what brings us to the position we are in tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very much united behind Senator Kemp. We do not regard him as having committed any offence&mdash;certainly not within the terms of standing order 203(e) in relation to persistently and wilfully disregarding the Chair. If what Senator Kemp did tonight&mdash;whether or not one regards it as more than laughing&mdash;is somehow characterised as persistently and wilfully disregarding the Chair, we might as well close up shop and go home. Everyone would be guilty of an offence every five minutes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where this particular issue got away from us is that, immediately Senator Kemp was named, I think I made the point that we should hear an explanation. We then started to have a variety of points of order. At that point Senator McMullan intervened, made a contribution and said `Let's get on with it'. Everyone on this side of the chamber assumed that that was the end of the issue. I did not even realise that Senator Coulter was talking to the point of order and then he moved the motion. I have to say that the Deputy President had no choice but to put it. The Standing Orders gave us no chance to intervene to try to apply some common sense, or to apply some sort of interpretation to what Senator Kemp had said. I took Senator Kemp's explanation as probably being sufficient. But when the motion was put we had no alternative but to back up the Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be said that at that point the Deputy President could have backed off, but he could not. Once the motion is moved, the Deputy President must put it. That again goes to the point where traditionally those sorts of motions are moved from this end of the chamber.

But it does not come to the point of a total shouting down of somebody who is trying to deliver a speech in this chamber. It bordered on that.

I arrived back at about 25 or 20 to nine&mdash;the car having picked me up at about a quarter past eight&mdash;and the bells were ringing.

I therefore thought it sensible&mdash;particularly in the unprecedented circumstance when the motion to suspend Senator Kemp was not in fact moved by a Government senator but by a member of a third, minority party&mdash;that the Senate should give further consideration to that unusual course of action of suspending Senator Kemp for laughing in the chamber. It certainly seemed to us that a reconsideration was warranted, and that is why I was seeking leave to move that immediately. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) has done so by way of procedure, and we will support that part of the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The withdrawal of our motion of no confidence puts us in a very difficult position, which I will try to explain. As was said on both sides of the chamber, the action to move a motion of no confidence in the Deputy President should not be taken without very serious consideration, and very serious consideration was given. We were of the view that the conduct of the Deputy President was such that he should no longer have the confidence of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My discomfort is that, by complying with this approach and in trying to meet the spirit of Christmas and so forth, it may well appear that we now regard our action as not of that consequence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to Senator Ray. In effect, he indicated that the Labor Party felt it was locked in to protect the Deputy President once Senator Coulter had taken this incredible action. I got the impression that Senator Ray was saying that it was not a hanging offence and that that course of action should not have been taken but that he did not really have any choice once Senator Coulter had taken the action that he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Senator Ray regretted what had occurred. That is why I wanted the chamber to reconsider what it had done and I wanted Senator Coulter to reconsider the action that he had taken. I would like to think that, on further reflection, he would think that that was not a sensible course of action. It certainly was not a course of action that would result in the type of environment that is necessary to make this place function in the future. I would have liked him to have had the opportunity to consider that. The Minister has, however, asked us to also withdraw the motion that we have just lost. I am not too sure how that is done in any event; it may not be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept that we lost that vote.

But the motion has been moved and we supported the Deputy President and continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Archer, in speaking in the debate, made some points. I did not agree with them all. When he got stuck into our side of the chamber I did not agree with that, and that is fair enough, but he made some comments about the impact of this action upon Senator Kemp.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, that is unacceptable on this side for the reason that we, in all honesty and sincerity, moved that motion out of sadness and slow anger as much as anything else, with a desire to see somebody put out of his misery.

Anyone who looked at the video replay would see that many of the rulings which led to the moving of the earlier motion came about out of anger on the part of the Chair.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to the motion moved by Senator Collins, and the one foreshadowed by Senator Hill&mdash;that is, simply to move the rescission motion&mdash;I think it is fair and reasonable that the motion be rescinded. Senator Colston rose in his place and asked Senator Coulter to repeat what he had said because he did not hear it the first time. He should have listened more attentively to what Senator Ray had to say. Senator Ray was offering him the way out, and he simply did not have the ability to accept that offer and rule that way. One will see that, in his anger&mdash;which is so obvious every time one looks at a replay of the way that these incidents arise&mdash;Senator Colston asked Senator Coulter to repeat the motion that he had moved and he really got himself into the mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite unreasonable for Senator Collins to ask what he has asked of this side of the chamber&mdash;which, as I said, moved the motion out of both a long sense of burning anger and injustice, and a sense of sadness to see a man in a position where he is unable to cope. If Senator Collins could see his way clear to put his motion into two parts&mdash;that is, two motions&mdash;then we would be able to vote accordingly. Otherwise, we ought to have Senator Hill's motion as he has sought leave to move it and we ought to be able to vote on that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise that to an extent the Opposition's feelings of grievance emerge from the fact that it appeared that the Deputy President had not taken into account the explanation that was asked for and very properly given and which, as Senator Ray and Senator Collins indicated, was one that was `acceptable'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the thing. It is unfair that Senator Colston was not given the opportunity. He should be given that opportunity. I believe it would then be proper for the Senate, having heard whatever Senator Colston had determined&mdash;in the event that he did accept that explanation&mdash;to move a motion, which I hope would be carried unanimously, supporting the decision of the Deputy President to accept Senator Kemp's explanation. That seems to me to be an indication of support for the ultimate decision taken by the Deputy President, if that were his decision. I do not want to prejudge it. It seems to me to be ridiculous that we cannot get together on a simple issue such as this, which I hope would, firstly, resolve this waste of time and, secondly, present some evidence of goodwill at this time of the year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is tonight belatedly considering a group of six Bills concerning the life and general insurance industries. These Bills include the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991, the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 and the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991. The Bills were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration before the second reading debate. That Committee has considered the legislation and Senator Coates has already presented the Committee's report to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals before us arose because of a financial scandal last year involving the attempted takeover of two life insurance companies, Regal and Occidental. These two insurers were, and still are, part of the Battery Group of companies. Battery decided to sell Regal and Occidental to an American investor, Mr Phillip Carver, via a company he controlled, Heath Holdings. The price was $132m payable in three instalments over 12 months. Of this, $65m was paid by the Bank of Melbourne to the Commonwealth Bank and the ANZ Bank to extinguish debts owed by Battery. This $65m had been taken from statutory funds of Regal and Occidental; that is, the statutory funds had been raided to pay for the acquisition of the life insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Michael Baume has remarked to the Senate in the past, this unauthorised use of the statutory funds of a life insurance company is contrary to section 38 of the Life Insurance Act. Yet, more than a year later no final legal action has been taken against the people who undoubtedly contravened this provision. Some other charges, however, may be laid against Mr Carver who was recently arrested at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport whilst attempting to leave Australia on a false passport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recipient banks refused to return the $65m, claiming that they had received the money in good faith and that they had extinguished loan obligations of equivalent value. A judicial manager, Mr Richard Grellman, was appointed under the Life Insurance Act by the Federal Court of Australia. This is the first such appointment and resembles the appointment of a receiver or a provisional liquidator in that the directors have been temporary replaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is his responsibility to continue to run the two insurance companies which still have about 90,000 policyholders and assets of over $300m. Legal action is being taken to recover the $65m, and there is a very good chance of success. A successful action has already been achieved which entitles the judicial manager to use the companies' funds to pursue this legal action. The whole matter is currently before the courts, so I will not mention it further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These extraordinary circumstances prompted the former Treasurer to intervene to abort any crisis which may have occurred. We can contrast this with a completely hands-off approach by him to the devastated Farrow Group crash in Victoria. After a succession of negotiations former Treasurer Keating, now Prime Minister elect, announced in January that a compulsory levy would be imposed on life insurers to make up 90 per cent of any shortfall in policyholders' funds which remained after all the relevant legal actions had been completed. Depending on the results of the various court cases there may not ever be any levy imposed under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earlier industry proposal for a voluntary levy could not be implemented, so a legislated response was sought and agreed to by the Government. The former Treasurer also announced proposals to allow the Treasurer to supervise all acquisitions of insurance companies in excess of 15 per cent of capital, to increase minimum capital standards for life and general insurers, to strengthen investigatory powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission as well as to increase duties of actuaries and to increase disclosure in the statutory returns of general insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these proposals are contained in the six Bills before us tonight. I think the central question in this legislation is:  should the Government be taxing all life insurance policies to subsidise policyholders who have incurred a loss through fraud?  The pure answer is no; the risk should be borne by the policyholders because all investments carry a degree of commercial risk, including the ultimate risk of failure of the institution. This must be balanced by the question of the health of the life insurance industry and the financial system as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the Treasurer took the view that the financial system was in some danger and, as such, intervention was necessary. Given the deregulatory bent of former Treasurer Keating, clearly there must have been some genuine fear, especially after the collapse of the Farrow Group of building societies. Also the extraordinary situation which arose in the Regal and Occidental affair should never be repeated because of the new powers of the Treasurer with respect to acquisitions of insurance company equity. This package should not be viewed as a precedent for bailing out investors in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, the Australian Democrats support the policyholders' levies legislation. The regulation of major acquisitions of insurance company equity is comparable to the provisions which have operated for many years in the banking industry and, therefore, is supported by the Democrats. The improved minimum capital standards should also lead to greater investor protection and are also welcomed. This should also speed the expected rationalisation of both the life and general insurance industries which are widely recognised as having too many participants. The provisions strengthening the investigatory powers of the Commissioner arise because of the shortcomings discovered during the investigation of the Regal and Occidental matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, a regulator must be in a position to investigate, report and act on any aspect of legislation which he or she has a duty to enforce. The proposals pertaining to this in the legislation are absolutely reasonable, are necessary and have the support of the Australian Democrats. The related proposals to increase the supervisory levies on both the life and general insurance industries to pay for the extra administration costs which this package imposes on the ISC are also consistent with the general cost recovery nature of the existing operation of the ISC. As such, the Democrats do not oppose this increase in the supervisory levies. There are many issues in the life insurance area which have not been addressed by the Government in this legislation. The Life Insurance Act has been under review for years. Perhaps Senator McMullan could inform the Senate of the progress of that review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General insurance in the public sector is also in a turbulent environment at the moment. Premier Greiner in New South Wales is preparing to privatise the GIO, the Victorian Opposition has stated its intention to privatise the Traffic and Accident Commission and the Commonwealth is still attempting to destroy the Housing Loan Insurance Corporation. None of these proposed privatisations is in any way driven by efficiency or by competitive considerations. Indeed, they will be anti-competitive and will generally disadvantage consumers. They are purely the result of ideological bias&mdash;the bias of the Prime Minister-designate of this country. Surely this process of deregulation and privatisation has done enough damage for those driving the process to be asked to justify their policies on the achieved gains. Any rational analysis would show us that New Zealand is not a good model to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are starting to hear some encouraging noises from Mr Crean and Senator Button about active Government policy in some areas. We await the economic statement in the new year. The biggest concern is the almost complete failure of the Australian capital markets to provide adequate development capital. The big institutions&mdash;that is, the life offices and the banks&mdash;have been unwilling to provide the development capital needed to commercialise our scientific achievements. Examples abound of real entrepreneurs&mdash;not paper shufflers&mdash;being forced to sell to foreign investors because of a lack of local interest. There are real gains to be made by Australian firms collaborating with foreign concerns with expertise and access in foreign markets, but the control should stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have said before and will say it again, and we know that many others are starting to agree with us, that deregulated financial markets have failed. It is time for the Government to acknowledge that specific regulation is needed and that it must act in this area. Failure to do so will continue to doom Australia to never become the cliched clever country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Due to a unique series of circumstances, described by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business</EMPHASIS> magazine as `one of the most botched deals in modern Australian corporate history', we have six insurance Bills before us for debate: the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991, the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 and the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These insurance Bills will hopefully achieve two things. Firstly, they will prevent a repeat of the Occidental and Regal Life debacle. Secondly, they will raise funds to compensate for a maximum of $65m which was misappropriated by placing a one-off levy on other insurance companies. It is not in the Senate's best interests for me to go into the full details of the failed sale of Occidental and Regal Life Insurance companies by the Battery group to a shelf company called Heath Holdings, although for those interested I would recommend an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business</EMPHASIS> magazine on April 24 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has not been said loudly and clearly in relation to this case, and which I wish to say today, is that we are essentially dealing with a banking problem which the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, chose to transfer to the insurance industry for it to deal with. The viability of the Bank of Melbourne was threatened as a result of their actions and the sale of Occidental and Regal. Rather than the Treasury having to bale out another failed financial institution, Mr Keating changed the focus of attention to insurance companies and put the onus on them to bale their colleagues out. What has happened in this instance is, indeed, unfortunate not only for those professionals involved but for all of the policyholders affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deal which took only two months to put together and one night to stuff up has resulted in two companies being put into the deep freeze for 12 months so far, and probably another 12 months while the legalities are sorted out. The picture is not totally grim, despite neither company writing new business. Policyholders can make claims but cannot surrender their policies, although death and disability pay-outs are being met. Policy renewals are lower and those who are paying their premiums for death and disability are being fully underwritten by Mercantile Mutual, which has effectively taken over Occidental and Regal's death and disability business. The situation could have been much worse but, hopefully, the amendments that we are debating here today will prevent a repeat performance of the Occidental and Regal Life debacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal briefly with the six Bills on an individual basis. First, the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 amends the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945. These amendments&mdash;which concern increasing the minimum capital and solvency requirements for authorised general insurers, minor amendments to the description of accounts and statements required by the Commissioner, et cetera, as explained by other speakers&mdash;are all welcome moves with which the Opposition has no problems. However, I am concerned that the tightening of prudential standards could cause a problem for the privacy provisions. It is not possible to keep a central register of people making false insurance claims, even though a third of the payments are suspected to be fraudulent. I also wish to address the concern raised by the Insurance Council of Australia at the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration with respect to clauses 24 to 26. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill amends both the Insurance Act and the Life Insurance Act to introduce virtually identical provisions, disqualifying directors and certain executive officers from holding office if they have been convicted of certain offences or become bankrupt. Whilst the industry accepts the principles of the decision, it expresses concern that there is no method by which a person could apply to a court to have the disqualification lifted in circumstances where the court was satisfied that the offence or bankruptcy did not justify the disqualification either because of the lapse of time or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation law is cited by way of comparison as a law with a similar disqualification which operates for only five years but, even in that period, a court has discretion to permit a disqualified person to manage a corporation. Whilst this matter was not pursued further by the Committee, I understand that, as part of the major review of the Life Insurance Act which the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is presently conducting, this matter will be considered. I look forward to reading the report of the review early next year and discovering whether the ISC recommends further amendment to clauses 24 to 26 in accordance with the ICA's submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991 and the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991 formally impose a levy on life insurance companies to compensate holders of life insurance policies of Occidental and Regal Life. They also contain provisions which will limit the total amount of levy collected under the legislation to $65m. I had planned to propose an amendment to these Bills until I read the Budget papers which made an additional provision. The papers state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has introduced legislation, as a one-off arrangement, to enable the imposition of one or more levies on registered life insurance companies to raise an amount not exceeding $65m.</PARA>
<PARA>That Bill has just passed the Senate. The timing and the amount of the levies, which will provide a measure of financial protection to policyholders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Ltd and Regal Life Insurance Ltd, will be dependent on the judicial management of those companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levies collected will be paid into a protection fund and are to be tax deductible to life offices, relating exclusively to non-fund assessable income. Grants paid to Occidental Life and Regal Life will be exempt from income tax and will be used to meet up to 90 per cent of the liabilities under life policies issued by Occidental Life and Regal Life. Certain payments to life offices representing surplus moneys from the protection fund will be treated as non-fund assessable income. These arrangements are being imposed because of the special and unusual circumstances involving an unauthorised dealing in statutory fund moneys of the two companies. The measures will operate from the date of royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention that, whilst the insurance industry considers that the imposition of an industry levy sets a dangerous precedent for similar intervention if other insurers were to fail, it is accepting of the fact that a levy needs to apply in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry, which has experienced explosive growth during the past decade, is dominated by two life companies which between them control 60 per cent of the market. Neither the industry nor the taxpayer could afford to support either of these giants were they ever to need help, which would be highly unlikely. Yet what would be the use of a support scheme that excluded these two?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The life companies initially objected to the imposition of a levy. However, they have accepted the need for it in this instance as a one-off levy and are happy to comply with it. They are even happier to comply with it now that the tax deductibility aspect has been addressed by this Government. The fact remains, though, that policyholders of all other groups have been disadvantaged as a result of fraud in one group. This is another instance of lack of prudential standards and the failure of the Government to move quickly during a period of explosive growth of the life insurance industry. Such payments on $65m give encouragement to those at the cheap and less ethical end of the market to write high risk business in the knowledge that major catastrophes will be picked up by government action. Imposing a levy has not been conducive to sending the right signals to encourage good practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were three objections raised by participants at the Finance and Public Administration Committee's hearings on these Bills. One of the comments I wish to raise here today relates to one of several comments made by Commonwealth Life Ltd. Its concern was that there is a group of contracts in the market where the way in which the investment earnings are credited to the policyholder is very tightly controlled by the policy wording. The concern was that clause 13 does not specifically cover that particular group of business where the wording of the policy would not allow the company to pass on the cost of the levy to the policyholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this concern, Senator McMullan stated, for the purposes of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and therefore for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act, that it is the Government's intention that this legislation be interpreted as a tax for the contract in the terms of policies which Commonwealth Life Ltd referred to. I would like Senator McMullan to iterate that point again, as he indicated he would be willing to do when the Bill came up for debate in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Committee's hearings, I also raised a point with Mr Grellman, the judicial manager, about provision for assistance to those policyholders who had elected voluntarily to discontinue payment of premiums under their policies. In response to this question I have received a fairly lengthy letter from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. My concerns in this area have been allayed to some extent as a result of its correspondence. However, I would appreciate the Government, and any others who will be responsible for compensating policyholders, bearing my point in mind during their deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill and the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill, I make several comments. The insurance industry is supervised by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, whose job will now be expanded as a result of the changes introduced in this legislation. In anticipation of extra staff to cope with this expanded workload, these supervisory levy amendment Bills allow for an increase in life and general insurance supervisory levies from $20,000 to $28,000 and from $11,600 to $15,000 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991. The purpose of this Bill is to set out rules for compulsory notification to the Minister of deals that would involve the transfer of a certain interest in an Australian insurance company, their assets or directors, and to allow the Minister the right to refuse approval of such deals. If this Bill had been in force a year ago, the Occidental and Regal Life situation probably would not have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Short has indicated, the coalition will be moving amendments to this Bill. A number of concerns were raised in relation to this Bill by those attending the Committee proceedings that have been taken up by the coalition in its amendments. The first concern was raised by the AMP over clause 5, which sets out the circumstances that are deemed to be contrary to the public interest for the acquisition or takeover of an insurance company. Their particular concern was with subclause (c), which refers to a situation that is likely to unduly concentrate economic power in the general or life insurance industry or in the Australian financial system. There are two points with regard to this subclause. The first is the concern that this requirement appears to cover very similar ground to that covered by section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, but with a different and more vague criterion. The concept of `unduly concentrate economic power' is very close to the domination concept in the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMP was particularly concerned that an insurance company which had a concern about the competitive effect of a proposed acquisition would need to seek the approval of both the Minister, under this legislation, and of the Trade Practices Commission. That is a situation which I describe as a double jeopardy situation. The second point is that the subclause relates to unduly concentrating economic power in the Australian financial system as well as in the insurance industry and that this type of cross-industry trade practices provision is unknown in other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members are also concerned about paragraph 5(1)(d) of the Bill. The paragraph defines a matter to be contrary to the public interest if it is contrary to the national interest. `National interest' is not defined in the Bill and, thus, we are concerned that the provision, requiring as it does a highly subjective judgment, might be used to unduly restrict entry to the insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item (a) of clause 5 relates to situations where an acquisition or takeover is likely to adversely affect the prudential conduct of the affairs of the company. Whilst this item is supported, it was pointed out at the Committee hearing that the Life Insurance Act contains no direct obligation to conduct a company's affairs in a prudent manner, and it is thought that it should contain such a provision, both on general principles and for consistency with clause 5(a) of the Bill. When this matter was raised in the Committee, Senator McMullan responded that it was a worthwhile comment which he would take on notice. I trust that the point has not been lost and that Senator McMullan will stand by his word in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like the honourable senator to reiterate for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> purposes the comments he made in the Committee about decisions under this clause being reviewable to the effect that, if it appeared that the Minister had made an arbitrary decision in the face of the facts, the AAT would overturn it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to clause 15 of the Bill. The Australian Bankers Association has drawn attention to the formula in clause 15(5). The intention is for a percentage to be calculated, but the formula as written does not result in a percentage. The Australian Bankers Association has suggested an easy remedy, and I would suggest that, for the sake of completeness, the alteration be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still on the acquisitions and takeovers Bill, National Mutual has expressed concern in relation to what is referred to as the trigger proposal. Its specific concern is with capital raising procedures. Without a National Mutual representative present at the hearing, this matter was passed over fairly quickly. National Mutual points out that the trigger proposals will complicate its capital raising process. The company then goes on to say that the inclusion of regulations, which may result in such proposals being exempted from compliance if the Minister sees fit, is of some comfort to it. It does, however, increase its workload, and I would not be surprised to see some changes in this area in time to come. There are probably deficiencies there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The losses of the Regal and Occidental Life companies have hastened the need for more and stronger government regulation of the life and general insurance industry. The lack of regulation has meant that too many small and inexperienced operators have entered the market. Hopefully, the legislation before us today will significantly tighten both the area of ability to enter the industry and the area of ongoing supervision so that the history books will never again record a debacle such as we have experienced with Occidental and Regal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these Bills were considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in October, the report of the Committee recorded a statement by Opposition senators, namely Senator Watson, Senator Campbell and Senator Kemp, supported by me, although I was not a member of the Committee. We expressed concern about aspects of the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill, one of which related to clause 5(1) of the Bill which defines circumstances which, for the purposes of the Bill, are deemed to be contrary to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (c) is of concern to us. As Senator Watson pointed out in his remarks, one of the basic reasons for that concern is that the terminology in paragraph 5 (1)(c) differs materially from the provisions of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act which addresses the same issue and which will also apply to the transactions in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports action to tighten as much as possible prudential standards in the insurance industry, but our view is that this particular paragraph is aimed at competition policy. Its inclusion in a Bill concerned with prudential matters is confusing, particularly given the established body of case law in relation to the existing trade practices legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed clause introduces an element of double jeopardy to the legislative environment in which the insurance industry operates and may represent an unnecessary barrier to entry to the insurance industry. I would have thought that that is a potential problem with which we would all be concerned because an open and competitive environment in the insurance industry in the interests of consumers&mdash;who comprise most Australians&mdash;is a very important requirement indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Bills were considered in the Standing Committee, I have noted several press articles dealing with the relationship of the Trade Practices Commission to the insurance industry.

The concern is as to how they interrelate and whether there is duplication and conflict, which matters require examination. Perhaps that is a topic for another occasion. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Hamburger</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Committee hearing into the package of insurance legislation on 13 September concern was raised about the interaction between paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill (IA&amp;T Bill) and section 50 of the Trade Practices Act (TPA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of points I would like to make which may assist Committee members in understanding the reasons for including paragraph 5(1)(c) in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of clause 5(1) is to deem a number of matters to be contrary to the public interest. Depending on the nature of the particular proposal involved, any one of matters included in clause 5(1) namely prudential conduct, unsuitable persons, undue concentration of economic power and national interest could become important from the viewpoint of assessing whether a proposal is considered to be against the public interest. For example, if a proposal is considered likely to lead to an undue concentration of economic power in the Australian general insurance industry, the Australian life insurance industry or the Australian financial system this provision makes it clear that this can be regarded as being contrary to the public interest. Similarly, if a proposal is considered to be contrary to the national interest it is deemed to be contrary to the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, we have been advised that even if the concentration of economic power aspect was removed from clause 5(1) it is arguable that the Treasurer could still find a proposal which unduly concentrated economic power in this way to be contrary to the public interest. In those circumstances, however, there could be a risk that a court or tribunal may consider that an undue concentration of economic power was not contrary to the public interest and overturn it. Thus the Bill seeks to remove any doubt that the public interest does encompass such considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The view was put in the Committee that requiring a proponent to meet both IA&amp;T Bill and TPA tests independently placed a discriminatory burden on insurers. This situation, however, is no different to that required in some other industries. For example, an Australian resident wishing to acquire an interest in a broadcasting company must meet the requirements of both the Broadcasting Tribunal and the TPC. Similarly a foreign person wishing to acquire an interest in any trading company must meet the requirements of both the FA&amp;T Act and the Trade Practices Commission (TPC). Simply because the Treasurer does not object to the proposal under the FA&amp;T Act does not mean approval from the TPC is not needed or is automatic. In this regard it is important to note that the Treasurer (or as it is expressed in the Bill, the Commonwealth Government) does not approve a proposal; rather, the Bill gives scope for expressing no objections to a proposal going ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are confident that where a proposal may be subject to examination under both the IA&amp;T Bill and the TPA, the potential for any difficulties to arise will be minimised through the consultation process which will be undertaken by the ISC while a proposal is being examined. A consultation process with other Government Departments has been specifically allowed for in clause 75(4) of the Bill. What is proposed is that consultation with the TPC will be undertaken as a matter of course on any proposal which involves an existing insurer acquiring a significant interest in another. The views of the TPC would therefore be taken into account in the Treasurer's decision on the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposed approach is, of course, consistent with the arrangements which have been followed in assessing foreign investment proposals under the FA&amp;T Act and no significant problems of the type raised by the Committee have occurred in the administration of that legislation. In contrast to the position under the FA&amp;T Act, however, where the proponent has no formal appeal avenues open, all adverse decisions (other than a temporary restraining order) under the IA&amp;T Bill are subject to internal and AAT Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, therefore, the Government has taken the view that the Bill should allow the Treasurer to have regard to all aspects which could impinge on whether a proposal might be against the public interest. Consequently it would be inappropriate not to have regard to concentration/competition considerations particularly given the increasingly important role insurance and superannuation is performing in the overall financial system. It would not be appropriate to rely on the provisions in the TPA for this purpose because the scope of conduct being regulated is different and there are different thresholds which apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope this information assists in clarifying some of the concerns which were raised about the interaction of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the IA&amp;T Bill and section 50 of the TPA during the Committee's hearing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in light of the comments that have been made by Senators Short and Kernot, who were both admirably brief in their comments. As was clear in the deliberations of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I am not without concern about the point that Senator Short raises. It is a question about which I have given some consideration and which I raised with relevant Ministers in the Government. Although I think competition policy is very important and we need to be very rigorous in its pursuit, I do not want us, in an ad hoc manner, to proliferate different standards in different pieces of legislation without good cause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are different standards in different pieces of legislation which apply due to the particular nature of industries. I wanted the Government to consider whether it believed that the circumstances of the industry we are dealing with here tonight were such that this clause was warranted as a special inclusion. After that consideration, the Government has formed the view, particularly given the increasingly important role that the insurance and superannuation industry is performing in the overall financial system, that it would be inappropriate not to have regard to concentration and competition considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that as long as we had the national interest element in there&mdash;I believe we should&mdash;any Minister making a decision under the legislation would give consideration to competition factors. Inevitably that would be so, but it is much better, if that is going to be the case, that it is explicitly stated in the legislation rather than subsumed into the broader national interest aspect. It would not be impossible to consider it under the national interest heading anyway, but that then means our having a more indirect statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the Government has formed the view that that would be a criterion Ministers would be likely to take into account, it is the view of the Government that it would more appropriately be explicitly stated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House of Representatives has returned to the Senate an amendment which was moved by the Opposition and supported by the Australian Democrats and thus passed by the Senate. The amendment concerned the deductibility regime for environmental impact costs. The Senate amendment was actually in two parts. The first was full deductibility in circumstances where a decision is made before the end of the current year of income to abandon the project or the project ends before the end of the current year of income, and the second was in other circumstances&mdash;in other words, where the projects proceeds&mdash;where 33 1/3 per cent of expenditure was allowable in each of the three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message from the House of Representatives was to accept that part of the amendment allowing full deductibility where the project does not proceed, but to reject that part of the amendment concerning the three-year deductibility write-off. The effect of that was to reinstate the original 10-year write-off, which the Opposition believed was too long. The Government does appear to be unduly concerned about the revenue implications. I regret the threat of the Government that a failure by the Senate to accede to the Government's request would result in the Government withdrawing from the Bill the whole of the deductibility provision proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has taken this threat very seriously. This is the last night on which this matter can be debated, and we are not sure what time the other House will rise. We also acknowledge that a number of companies will be balancing on 31 December. Our failure to agree tonight could result in this Bill being held over until perhaps April next year. Recognising that those companies will have to pay their first taxation instalment in January 1992, they will be severely affected. We are not prepared, under such a threat, to put them in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Government that it was its timetable to delay this to the last possible minute, thus, the wrath of industry falls squarely on the Government's head. We are not prepared in these dire economic times to have industry denied an appropriate deductibility regime, even over 10 years. That is the threat that is put to us in the dying hours of this year, prior to Christmas. I certainly hope that the sorts of standover tactics that we have seen tonight with this Bill, and in the earlier debate, are not a signal of the new Keating Ministry, because it will not be in the best interests of Australia. It is regrettable that this, the first Bill that we have seen under the Keating Administration, is so dictatorial, so demanding and so demeaning of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the Government alleges that it is concerned about shortcomings in the Income Tax Assessment Act, particularly those shortcomings that affect the competitiveness of Australian industry vis-a-vis those operating in the international field. Our proposal would have put the legislation on a par with the world's best. What we are doing is relegating Australian industry to second-rate status, making it harder for it to compete. I find it hard to accept, in the knowledge that next year an improved deductibility regime will be introduced. It is basically pigheadedness on the part of the Government. I suppose it will be seen to be a sign of strength; but it is a sign of folly, and I do not believe it will be well taken up by industry at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) referred to the Department of the Prime Minister <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>and Cabinet the concern about the efficiency of the taxation deductibility regime. Certainly this would be one issue that would be examined. There is some concern that there has been inadequate communication within the Government for it to come to this sort of decision. It is a decision that was probably made by Treasury, without adequate communication either with Prime Minister and Cabinet, which has this reference before it in relation to depreciation, or DITAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this matter in a question this afternoon. I am also concerned that in this whole deductibility regime the Minister has not yet come back to parliament and told those companies that balance on 31 December how they will deal with the statement on industry depreciation. They will be disadvantaged. I think it is pretty poor legislative tactics for the Government to offer a carrot and not produce within the appropriate time schedule a legislative base that will enable companies to effect an appropriate deduction, which allegedly was promised over nine months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this wrath from industry will in time fall very heavily on the head of the Australian Government. I therefore regret the decision that has been made, which is certainly not in the national interest. A few moments ago we were talking about legislation that basically involved certain decisions in the national interest. I do not believe that this is in the national interest, particularly at a time of ailing investment in manufacturing and mining. These are the two industries that surely should help bring Australia out of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases the environmental impact studies involve a necessary expense, incurred under legislation or as a result of Commonwealth, State or local government decree.

The Government is accepting one part, and so I will not waste any time talking about that; that has now been agreed by all parties in the chamber. Regarding the other part, I made this statement during the committee stage in the principal debate and so I will reiterate it very briefly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two basic flaws with that. I think it is appropriate that we have taken a step forward to recognise through the taxation system those expenses, but it is unrealistic to be writing them off over three years, and it is, in effect, a subsidy on the conduct of environmental impact statements. We do not believe that we should subsidise it because it is bad tax policy; also, I believe that not one jot of extra environmental activity would be undertaken as a consequence of this amendment, because the environmental impact statement requirements on companies are set down in other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that we were not originally disposed to agree to the amendment and it is why, I confess, we took a fairly strong line against it, although not uncompromising, because we did propose the compromise that came back from the House of Representatives, which has been accepted. Everybody would prefer that we never had to have forthright negotiations around this place. It would be nice if those things did not occur.

Some might, because of their other package of policies, want to go further with bits of it, but it is not a matter where we have strong contention. </PARA>

History will be our judge, but the compromise that has come back from the House of Representatives which accepts part of the Opposition's amendment may prove to be even better legislation than that which the Government introduced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Political Broadcasts (Tasmania) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 482, and the Political Broadcasts (Australian Capital Territory) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1991 No. 483, made under the Broadcasting Act 1942, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to speak briefly to the motion I have moved. As everybody would know, this was one of the most outrageous pieces of legislation ever placed before this Parliament. It commenced in a way that would have banned all advertising on radio and television at all times&mdash;365 days of the year&mdash;for Federal, State and local government elections. As time went by it was somewhat amended. It was also a major reason why the Australian Democrats changed their leader. It was apparent that a deal had been made with the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) and their then leader, Senator Powell. It was genuinely thought that this legislation, having been referred to the Senate Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures&mdash;and I refer to that part relating to the ban on advertising, not that part relating to disclosure provisions&mdash;would disappear, never to be seen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did we see? We saw the new leader of the Democrats up his price on the previous agreement, the apparent back room deal, that was made. It was a low figure. We saw yet again another deal made which would give the Democrats something like $1.8m of free radio, and free television ads in particular, and another amount to all parties which totalled somewhere in the order of $8m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had what I could only call a ratty provision&mdash;one that will not work&mdash;whereby in an election a brochure is distributed to every householder in Australia showing the photograph, curriculum vitae and short policy of every candidate, at the taxpayers' expense. There are two reasons why this could make a mockery of the whole electoral system. One is that the straight logistics of it will make it almost impossible for this brochure to be delivered because, in the main, it is not known until nominations close, except by those who know well in advance that they have been preselected by a political party, who will nominate. From that day on it takes approximately 20 days for the Electoral Commission to get a photograph, curriculum vitae and short policy statement, put it into a brochure and have it distributed to every household in Australia. It is an incredible waste of taxpayers' money and an abuse of the taxpayer because surely it is the role of candidates and political parties to let the electorate know who they are and what they stand for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of that which I believe will cause incredible problems to the integrity of the electoral system is that it will encourage anyone in the community, for a simple nomination fee of $250, to be able to nominate and get a brochure distributed which describes his or her job and policies. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that it would be an attraction to local business people to spend the $250 and get the brochure distributed. More likely, however, is that political parties will see this as a cheap opportunity to have multiple Independents stand, even though they are really fronts for political parties, and have these brochures distributed in the hope, particularly in marginal seats, that they will pick up just a few extra votes that could take them over the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major reason that we are opposing these regulations that apply to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill is a legal opinion we obtained from the Robert Garran Professor of Law at the Australian National University, Professor Synes. I am happy to quote this because in debate during the political broadcasts Bill the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) said that he had a legal opinion to say that what was in the Bill, which is now an Act, was constitutional and could not be subject to challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Synes is one of the most respected constitutional lawyers in this country, and it was for that reason that we sought his opinion. He made it very clear that the provisions could not validly operate in respect of State elections. That is what these regulations are about. They refer to the ACT and Tasmania because within about seven or eight weeks or so&mdash;in early February&mdash;there will be an election in the ACT. It is also anticipated that there could well be an election in Tasmania. These regulations remain in force until and if they are disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that seeking leave tonight to have this matter debated is an opportunity to consider this issue. I really exhort the Australian Democrats to consider this move because the advices we have, of which I am happy to give them a copy, make this very clear. I interpolate that I am sure we all welcome Senator Kemp back into the Senate. I hope that he has not been too lonely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regulations seek to impose the will of a centralist Federal government upon the States. When the Bill was initially mooted and introduced by the Minister in the middle of this year, the whole hype of it concerned Federal elections, disclosure and a range of other matters. These regulations tell the States how they must operate. As pointed out by Professor Synes, the central provisions relating to State elections are those contained in section 95D as is now in the Act. He points out that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clearly established that the Commonwealth may not discriminate against one or more States or impair their capacity to exist or function as independent units of the federation.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, the only ground on which federal laws have been declared invalid under this implied principle has been that they discriminated against the States generally, as compared with other persons.</PARA>
<PARA>He then quotes some cases and points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not fall foul of this aspect of the principle.</PARA>
<PARA>But in his view it impairs the capacity of a State to function as an independent unit of federation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While no federal law has, as yet, been invalidated on this ground, the principle has been reasserted on a number of occasions in recent times. What it is that may not be destroyed or impaired has been variously described as `the structural integrity of the State components of the federal framework...'</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is involved, here, is not the impairment of a State's powers or functions of government, which occurs of course, every time a federal law controls a State. The implied principle protects the State as an organisation of government, that is to say its general structure, machinery and processes by which it exercises whatever governmental powers and functions it has.</PARA>
<PARA>He points out that a Commonwealth law which purported, for example, to control the appointment of State Ministers, judges, the procedure of its Parliament or its relationship between its Parliament and the Executive would clearly come within the implied prohibition. Again, to quote from Professor Synes&mdash;and this is the nub of the issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that the control of advertising and persuasion for purposes of State elections comes within the same category. The process of election is fundamental to the organisation and structure of State governments. It is the process which determines the composition of both its legislature and its executive, therefore, a federal law which purported to control the advertising of political matter in relation to a State election would be contrary to the implied constitutional prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the key to it is at the end, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the heart of the . . . matter is the impairment of the capacity of a State to function as an independent unit of the federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have indicated, that is the major reason why we believe these regulations should be opposed. Of course, we have a deeper philosophical point of view. Right from the word go, we have been absolutely consistent in our view: a view that was shared by the Standing Committee. It said that, having looked at the banning of advertising on radio and television,  it would walk away from it, even though it had some appeal, because it attacked freedom of speech and freedom of political expression in Australia. That was contained in the majority report of the Standing Committee. In my own State, the Premier, Mr Goss, stated quite categorically that he did not support the legislation because it was an attack on freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very precious heritage of freedom in this country. This Act, as it now is, attacks those freedoms. It attacks the freedoms at a Federal level&mdash;which of course was our major cause of concern. We have made the point clear to the Democrats over and over again that as far as we were concerned there was no compromise when it came to an attack on freedom of political expression or freedom of speech. One either accepts the principle of those freedoms or one does not; there is no such thing as a half-way house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the reason why I have moved this motion. I really encourage the Democrats to think seriously about it. It is not just a general attack on freedom of speech, but it is now our strong view&mdash;in the presence of considerable legal opinion from the Robert Garran law professor at ANU&mdash;that it would be unconstitutional and invalid in respect of its application to the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what these two regulations, which have been introduced tonight, do. They seek to impose on the States this ban on paid advertising on radio and television during election campaigns. We have an ex-Prime Minister who talked about federalism and cooperation with the States; yet the Government not only has an Act that is the most outrageous attack on freedom of speech in federal elections that this country has ever seen, but also it is now applicable, under the regulations, to the States. The first two cabs off the rank are the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise a point of interest. The Democrats went along with this legislation and, curiously, as well as the coming ACT elections, a referendum is to be held. I do not know whether the Democrats received a letter, but I certainly received one from the group of people who are supporting the Hare-Clarke proportional representation system within the ACT. That group has written to the ex-Prime Minister and asked, `Do you know what you have done?'. A large slab of those people who are supporting the Hare-Clarke system in the ACT referendum are Democrats. There is a sort of union of people&mdash;in fact, it comprises everyone except the ALP which is pushing single member electorates&mdash;which wants to promote the Hare-Clarke system because these people believe it is more appropriate to the ACT and it will bring about a fair result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have written to the ex-Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and they have said, `Do you know what you have done?  You have prevented us from taking out advertisements to promote the Hare-Clarke system within the ACT'. This is only the beginning of the sorts of things we will find. I would not hesitate one bit&mdash;in view of my earlier remarks about the unworkable aspects of the silly brochure and the constitutional requirements&mdash;to say that this Act will not survive. It should not survive; it is atrocious. It is an attack on freedom of political expression the like of which this country has never seen before. It is totally and utterly un-Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1991 relates to a direct consequence of the Hawke Government's disastrous economic policies&mdash;that is, the number of bankruptcies which are spiralling and out of control. In 1989-90 there were 8,552 bankruptcies in Australia, which was then the highest figure ever. In 1990-91 the figure leapt dramatically by more than 50 per cent to 13,091. The quarterly bankruptcy statistics for the September quarter this year show a 72 per cent increase in comparison with the same quarter last year. Australian people and businesses are going to the wall at an absolutely unprecedented rate. In fact, in the present economic climate, it is not so much surprising that there are so many bankruptcies but rather that the figure is not even higher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of these bankruptcies happen to ordinary Australians. However, there has been a great deal of community outrage at the disgraceful way in which some of the high profile erstwhile mates of this Government have managed to avoid the law. For too many of these failed entrepreneurs bankruptcy has not even amounted to a minor interruption to their opulent lifestyles. The coalition is therefore pleased that the Government has taken some action to tighten up the law relating to bankruptcy through the introduction of this Bill. The Minister conceded in his second reading speech that this Bill is a response to a feeling in the community that the mechanisms in the Bankruptcy Act for obtaining income contributions from bankrupts who can afford it have been less effective than they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces a range of amendments to bankruptcy law principally in relation to discharge from bankruptcy, contributions by bankrupts to the bankrupt estate from their income, and procedures for meetings of creditors. The Bill replaces the court ordered discharge system with an administrative system based on clearly specified eligibility and disqualification criteria; clarifies the grounds on which a bankruptcy can be prolonged by objection and provides for objections in certain circumstances to extend bankruptcies to eight years; prohibits overseas travel without court approval by bankrupts liable to make contributions to income; sets up a compulsory income contributions regime which applies to bankrupts who have an income above the specified threshold amount; puts in place new administrative enforcement mechanisms to facilitate the recovery of property into bankrupt estates and to enable efficient collection of contributions; expands the powers of the official receivers to obtain information and to undertake inquiries in relation to the financial affairs of bankrupts, including inquiries overseas; clarifies creditors meeting procedures to ensure that creditors are fully informed before making decisions relating to the future course of a bankruptcy administration; provides for regular indexation of money amounts specified in the legislation; and gives jurisdiction to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review decisions of trustees and officials of the bankruptcy administration in connection with the proposed new discharge and income distribution arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 131 of the Bankruptcy Act provides that a bankrupt is able to retain income for his or her own benefit subject to any court order to the contrary. Such court orders are, however, expensive to obtain and in many cases the trustee in bankruptcy will simply not have sufficient funds to go to court. In any event, the only sanction for non-compliance with the contribution order is imprisonment for contempt of court, which is hardly a suitable remedy and is very unlikely to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many bankrupts&mdash;I am sure that we are all familiar with some of the more high profile examples&mdash;consequently manage to earn large incomes after bankruptcy and also manage to avoid paying anything to their creditors from that income. It is regrettably easy to hide assets and income out of the reach of creditors, often through the use of associated entities, even though the bankrupt is still deriving benefit from that income. Under the provisions in this Bill, income is defined to include benefits which, if they were provided by an employer to an employee, would be taxable as fringe benefits under the fringe benefits legislation. It would also include the amount of any money or the value of any other consideration received by a person other than the bankrupt from another person or associated entity as a result of work done or services performed by the bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trustee in bankruptcy will be able to make an assessment of the income likely to be derived by the bankrupt during the contribution and assessment period, which will be an annual period beginning at the commencement of bankruptcy. The trustee, in making the assessment, will be able to take into account any information about the bankrupt's employment or income. If the bankrupt claims not to be receiving income or to be unemployed but is engaged in activities which resemble employment and are capable of generating income, the trustee will be able to treat the bankrupt as being employed or in receipt of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The base threshold amount is 3.5 times that which at any time is the maximum basic rate of pension. At present, this would be an annual income of about $23,000 for a person without dependants. The bankrupt will be able to contribute half of the assessed income above the actual income threshold amount. If a bankrupt's income is below the actual income threshold amount, they will not have to make contributions, although they can do so if they choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to new section 139T, the official receiver will be able to authorise departure from the relevant contribution level in cases of hardship for medical reasons, work related expenses or child-care. Decisions by trustees in relation to income assessment will be reviewable by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Under proposed sections 139ZK and 139ZL, the official receiver will be empowered to collect moneys owing by way of contribution from third parties through garnishment or a charge over property. These provisions are based on section 218 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to early discharges of bankruptcy, section 150 of the Bankruptcy Act currently provides that a person may apply to the court for an order of discharge at any time after the date of bankruptcy. Making an application to the court is an expensive procedure and therefore little used. When it is used it is almost always by persons who have become bankrupt through failed business activities who wish to be discharged so that they can resume those activities. Low income earners can rarely afford to apply for discharge. The eligibility and disqualification criteria introduced in this Bill are designed to ensure that a person who has become a bankrupt because of commercial culpability is disqualified from early discharge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that a bankrupt will be able to apply for discharge after six months have passed since filing a statement of affairs with the registrar. The trustee then assesses the application to determine whether the applicant is eligible for and is not disqualified from early discharge. The eligibility criteria are that the bankrupt has no or insufficient money to pay the trustee or to pay a dividend to the creditors, has not entered into a transaction that is void against the trustee, and earns an income which is less than the actual income threshold amount applicable to him or her at the time the early discharge application is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bankrupt will be disqualified if he or she has previously been a bankrupt, if more than 50 per cent of his or her unsecured liabilities were incurred as a result of the bankrupt carrying on business activities, if he or she has unsecured liabilities which exceed 150 per cent of his or her income in the year immediately before the date of bankruptcy, or if he or she has given false or misleading information about his or her beneficial interests in any property or his or her liabilities or income. Decisions by trustees in relation to early discharge will be subject to review by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Automatic discharge from bankruptcy normally after three years can at present be objected to on the grounds set out in section 149 and include unsatisfactory conduct on the part of the bankrupt and failure to cooperate in the administration of his or her estate. In proposed section 149D, the Government sets out new more detailed grounds for objection which include the bankrupt continuing to manage a corporation contrary to the corporations law, failing to provide information about assets liabilities and income where required to do so by the trustee, departing Australia without permission or failing to return when requested to do so, and failing to attend a meeting of creditors. Some of these grounds will extend the bankruptcy for up to eight years, others for five years. In order to encourage bankrupts to file statements of affairs, which often happens when the bankruptcy is by creditors' petition, the period of bankruptcy will run for three years from the date of filing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to overseas travel restrictions, the Bill also contains provisions that are designed to restrict such travel by bankrupts. Bankrupts who are assessed as liable to make contributions to the estate from their income will not be allowed to undertake overseas travel except with the permission of the court. This permission will only be granted where the travel is necessary on compassionate grounds or where it is necessary for the bankrupt to travel in order to derive income. It will not be granted if the bankrupt has been guilty of conduct that would found an objection to discharge under proposed section 149D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions of this Bill, the official receiver and registered trustee will be able to recover property disposed of by a bankrupt in a transaction designed to defeat creditors which is void against the trustee by administrative means. Presently, this can be done only through the courts and it is expected that the new procedure based on similar provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act will be more cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Difficulties can arise particularly in the context of complex bankruptcies in the conduct of creditors' meetings. This Bill sets out detailed meeting procedures so that creditors are aware of their rights and trustees are aware of their responsibilities. It provides that creditors will be able to remove a trustee by resolution, not only by special resolution. Bankruptcy law, in what is necessarily a difficult balance, aims to help the bankrupts get back on their feet, while at the same time obtaining the best possible result for creditors. While this Bill will make it more difficult for bankrupts to avoid the law, the coalition does have serious concerns that it singles out business owners and operators for special punishment by disqualifying them from the early discharge procedure under Part VII, Division 3 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition sees no reason to treat all business bankrupts, the majority of whom are victims of the recession we had to have, in this discriminatory way when the fault lies with a few of the Hawke Government's big business mates. I therefore take this opportunity to foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment which reflects this concern, and that in the committee stage I will be moving for the deletion of proposed section 149Y which provides that a bankrupt is disqualified from early discharge if involved in business activities before the bankruptcy and more than 50 per cent of his unsecured liabilities were incurred as a result of carrying on business activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill is directed at four main areas: the movement of bankrupts out of Australia;  voting procedures at creditors' meetings; repayment of creditors from income;  and the period of bankruptcy. Like Senator Hill, I observe that this Bill is being brought in at a time when we have an unprecedented increase in bankruptcies in Australia due to the current depression. It is not before time that amendments are introduced to tighten up the provisions governing the administration of bankrupt estates because some of the current provisions have enabled high flying bankrupts to leave Australia and at least for a time, and sometimes all together, to escape their responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of movement of bankrupts out of Australia, it should be observed that currently there are relevant provisions in the current legislation. Section 77(a) of the Bankruptcy Act requires a bankrupt forthwith after becoming a bankrupt to furnish the trustee with the bankrupt's passport, if any. Section 272 of the Act is also relevant, providing that it is an offence to leave Australia with the intent to defeat creditors. This Bill provides that a bankrupt who is assessed as liable to make contributions to the estate from his or her income will not be able to travel overseas except by permission of the court, although permission will be able to be granted for compassionate reasons: for instance, the death of or serious injury to a close relative or where travel is necessary to enable the bankrupt to continue to derive income. Therefore, these amendments clarify and strengthen the provisions currently in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have been criticised on the basis that, with regard to travel restrictions, it may be more beneficial to provide trustees with clearer guidelines rather than making it necessary for bankrupts to apply to the courts. Further, the example is given that in a recent case a bankrupt requested the return of her passport to visit a dying relative, the trip being paid for by members of the family. Had court approval been required at that stage, this would only have added more cost and grief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the rationale between the tougher restrictions on overseas travel by bankrupts is the basic assumption that, as a general rule, bankrupts should remain in Australia during the bankruptcy and that the instances of overseas travel by bankrupts genuinely justified by employment or compassionate grounds would be very rare indeed. The absence of the bankrupt from Australia potentially is so disruptive of the proper administration of the estate that it is advisable for it to be a matter appropriate for consideration by a court rather than by the trustee. The Australian Democrats believe that the proposed amendment will strengthen the legislation in this area. It is clearly more sensible to assess an application for travel prior to departure rather than to attempt to impose a penalty after the event. It is also worth emphasising again that the requirement will only apply to bankrupts above the income threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The voting procedures of creditors' meetings are largely uncontroversial. One of the aims of the Bill in this area is to reform voting procedures so that trustees may be removed by majority in value rather than number, and at least three-quarters in value of creditors are required. I refer briefly to clause 64H which provides for telephone conferences and foreshadow that the Australian Democrats will support the Opposition's amendment in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of repayment of creditors from income, criticism has focused on the fact that once again there is already provision in the Act for payment from income and that bankrupts will be reduced to a subsistence level. At present, section 131 of the Act provides that a bankrupt is able to retain income for his or her own benefit, subject to any order of the court to the contrary. In the second reading speech, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 131 has not been a particularly useful instrument for trustees in bankruptcy to employ. The court process is costly to invoke and, frequently, neither has the trustee funds available to initiate the process nor are creditors willing to advance funds to the trustee to enable the trustee to take action. Frequently, once made, orders are not complied with by the bankrupt. The only sanction for non-compliance with a contribution order is imprisonment for contempt of court. This is a  severe sanction, and not particularly useful&mdash;an imprisoned bankrupt cannot earn income to contribute to the estate.</PARA>
<PARA>Hence, the Australian Democrats are favourably disposed to the proposed amendments in clause 25 of the Bill, which would make the contribution from a bankrupt's income compulsory where the income is above a minimum threshold which `will be set well above the level of pensions and related benefits'. The Bill provides for a basic income threshold amount equal to three and a half times what at any time is the maximum basic rate of pension. As at 1 July 1991, this would reflect a gross annual income of $22,886.50 for a person with no dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes allowances for changes in liability to reflect amounts actually earned during an assessment period, and for variation by the Official Receiver where the bankrupt suffers hardship. Clause 139T(2) sets out reasons on which an application may be based, and more may be prescribed later by regulation. There is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have some concern about a particular provision in clause 139T(5). This subclause provides that where the Official Receiver does not respond to an application on the basis of hardship within 30 days, the application is deemed to have been refused. This procedure appears to unnecessarily disadvantage the applicant on the basis of hardship. In effect, he or she will be penalised if the officers working in the Official Receiver's office do not perform their duty as they should within 30 days. Accordingly, I will be moving an amendment which will seek to reverse this situation and deem the decision to have been positive, in favour of the applicant, if the Official Receiver has not responded to the application within 30 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is later found that the decision is, in substance, unsatisfactory, the Official Receiver has no possibility of appeal under current legislation. I have been advised that it would be a relatively easy matter to insert a further amendment to the effect that such a right of appeal would be available to the Official Receiver. Shortage of time has prevented me providing that amendment. I advise the Government and the Opposition that this avenue remains open. On balance, the proposed amendment in this area represents an improvement over current procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the period of bankruptcy. I note that the changes in this area are substantial. At present, under section 149, bankruptcy usually lasts for three years and early discharge can be obtained only on application by the court under section 150. The Government suggests that only a very small percentage of bankrupts can presently avail themselves of this right because of the great costs involved. Under the new regime proposed in the Bill, the three-year period will continue to apply in the ordinary course of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early discharge under an administrative system will be introduced and will be available automatically to bankrupts who repay their creditors in full, or where the bankrupt has neither significant property nor significant income to make contributions. Clearly, this will contribute substantially to the swift rehabilitation of a significant proportion of bankrupts who currently remain in the bankruptcy system for three years to no purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes that bankrupts be ineligible for an early discharge where their liabilities exceed a specified percentage of pre-bankruptcy income; where the bankrupt has failed to disclose assets, liabilities or income; where the bankrupt has incurred credit after bankruptcy without disclosing it; or where the bankrupt continues to manage a corporation unlawfully once bankrupt. Additionally, in a small number of cases, bankruptcy will be prolonged administratively for up to eight years where, for instance, the bankrupt fails to make the required contributions from income, incurs substantial further credit or fails to account adequately for the disposal of income or property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats share the Opposition's concern about clause 149Y, which penalises people carrying on business and includes them under the disqualification provisions against early discharge from bankruptcy. In this current climate in particular, but even in general terms, we can see no reason why this should be so. However, we believe that clause 149Z should be retained, as it covers the area where people incur debts without having the reasonable expectation of being able to repay. This clause, being general, covers both personal debts and debts incurred during the conduct of a business. We believe that this adequately covers the objectives which the Government might have had in introducing this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1991 is being dealt with on the same evening that Mr Keating was elected by the Australian Labor Party as the Prime Minister of Australia. It should really be called the Keating Amendment Bill because `Keating' and `bankruptcy' are synonymous. Today, this man who created the worst recession in Australia's history was elected to the top job by the people of the Labor Party. It is a disgrace that this man should be rewarded for bankruptcy. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will be aware, as will all members of the Government, that bankruptcies were up 53.1 per cent in 1990-91 from what they were in 1989-90; up 72.2 per cent in the September quarter of 1991-92; and up 154 per cent between 1982-83&mdash;the last year of the Liberal Government&mdash;and the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the man who has brought this sort of bankruptcy. Mr Keating is the man who said, `I think loyalty is the stuff of politics; political parties are built on loyalty'. Unfortunately, Bob Hawke did not believe Mr Keating when he said that. These bankruptcies are brought to us by the man who, on 30 May, said, `It is not true that this is the worst recession in 60 years'. Fortunately, Australia does not believe Mr Keating either. These bankruptcies are brought to us by the man who said, `We won't let there be a recession'. No-one believed him when he said that. These bankruptcies are brought to us by the man who said, `I am not sitting here desperate to be Prime Minister'. Who would believe him when he said that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bankruptcies are brought to us by the man who, in March 1991, said, `The worst is now behind us; the Government established the strategy'. We are still suffering and, if it were funny, we would be laughing, that someone could be so base as to make those sorts of claims. These bankruptcies are brought to us by the man who, in February, said, `We won't destroy business activity; we won't destroy employment'. We now have one million of our fellow Australians unemployed. These bankruptcies are brought to us by the man who said, `We are well on the way to prosperity'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bankruptcies are brought to us by the man who said, `I think a lot of the lay-offs are behind us; I think they laid them off last year'.

These bankruptcies are brought to us by the man who, in August 1991, said, `I have never committed myself to a policy or a decision I was ashamed of'. On the night that this man has been elected to the top position in our political system, we are debating this Bill. I think it is most appropriate that the welcome to Mr Keating as Prime Minister is recognised by the Senate dealing with this Bankruptcy Amendment Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not an original comment. As the honourable senator correctly reminds me, that was a comment by Senator McKiernan. This is a sorry day for Australia. I believe it is a sorry day for Senator Button, because of the role that people such as him have played in undermining Mr Hawke. I am not a supporter of Mr Hawke but we have seen Senator Button in this chamber day after day refusing to give any sense of commitment and loyalty to the man who was the Prime Minister of this country, who was thrown from office and who was politically killed by a thousand stabs from his closest colleagues. I think that what we have seen is a sorry day in Australian history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish briefly to make some comments on particular aspects of this Bill. As many people have observed, this Bill comes to us on the heels of the corporate cowboys of the 1980s. Perhaps the one who has received the greatest press in recent days is Mr Christopher Skase. There would be very few Australians who would not share the view that the massive debts run up by Mr Skase and his Qintex company in his greedy splurge in the 1980s were nothing short of appalling. The demise of these corporate cowboys affected many innocent people. The effects of these empire failures took jobs from many Australians and placed losses and costs on banks, which will ultimately be borne by average Australians. They left, in short, a ruinous trail in their wake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill goes some way to addressing the problems that we have seen in recent months. One measure in the Bill before us today imposes a prohibition on travel without prior approval by bankrupts liable to make contributions from income. However, in our view, this Bill clearly does not go far enough. Given the short time available, I do not plan to proceed at length on that point, but I just draw attention to the fact that in 1988 the Government commissioned a report into the insolvency laws known as the Harmer report. The reforms within the Harmer report were welcomed by the insolvency industry as providing real and substantial suggestions as to how the current regulatory framework could be improved. However, since the Harmer report was handed down, the Government has allowed it to gather dust. I think that that is a pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not be concluded from any of my remarks today that the aim of any new legislation should be to penalise all bankrupts in the way that most Australians would believe that the corporate cowboys should be dealt with. It is a sad fact that, as a direct result of the Hawke-Keating Labor Government induced recession, the rate of bankruptcies has soared in recent times. It is a shocking fact that, in the last financial year, one in 1,000 adult Australians were declared bankrupt. Personal bankruptcies soared to over 13,000 in the last year to June, up from 8,600 just one year earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home State&mdash;also the home State of Senator Button&mdash;the figures are just as devastating. In fact, in Victoria we had the double whammy, as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;a Labor government in Canberra and a Labor government in Victoria. The joint results of those two disastrous governments have seriously affected the capacity of business to remain viable and, in fact, many people in Victoria have been forced to file for bankruptcy. In the last three months to the end of September 1991, some 1,146 people filed for bankruptcy in Victoria. This constitutes a 75 per cent increase over the same quarter in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Government stands condemned for placing before the chamber today a Bill which, while seeking to achieve a positive end in relation to corporate cowboys, has ignored many of the reforms contained in the 1988 Harmer report. Such reforms would have the effect, in many ways, of assisting those average Australians who have fallen victim to the Government's self-induced savage recession. The Bill before us today does not go far enough in this regard. </PARA>

Those persons who wish to spend so freely, using money advanced by others, without having proper, prudent regard to the question of whether they really have the capacity to repay, ought not be entitled to be discharged from bankruptcy after six months but should remain bankrupt for the ordinary three-year period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise it is now very late at night, but I would like to express my appreciation to all of those people who have worked so hard to keep this chamber and Parliament House running. I think it would be an understatement to say that this has been an interesting year, culminating in what has been a momentous day, particularly for those of us on the government side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 sittings have been some of the most relentless since Federation, with the Senate sitting part of every month except July. We have had a lot of late night sittings, including the first all night sitting in a quarter of a century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own perspective the year's rulings have been more difficult and complex than I have previously experienced. In addition to matters arising from the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, and notably the rulings concerning contingent notices when a Bill is under guillotine, rulings have been required in relation to the Westpac documents; Question Time, and Ministers remaining after Question Time; content of notices of motion, particularly in the light of changes to standing order 76; unparliamentary language; and, of course, numerous points of order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Senate would be disappointed if I did not mention the conduct of Question Time. For the record, I would like to note that this year the average number of questions per day was 22.8. This was the best since 1984. In addition, I would also like to note that until about one month ago we were heading for an average of over 23.5 questions per day, which would have been the best since 1982. I do not want to lay any blame on either side of the chamber, but it is a pity that the events of the last month have spoilt this record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another notable feature of the year has been the televising of the Senate and its committees. Honourable senators now seem to regard this as a normal part of the proceedings of both the Senate and the committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 we have also seen the publication of the sixth edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, which was launched by the President of the Administrative Review Council, Professor Cheryl Saunders, and I was pleased to be there and to take part in that ceremony. It was subsequently tabled in the Senate by Senator Durack. We also saw the passage of unique resolutions through both Houses concerning the proposed joint meeting of the Houses to hear an address by Mr George Bush, President of the United States. We also saw the tenth anniversary of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which was marked by a very successful seminar on the Committee, which was attended also by Lord Thurlow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary departments have played their usual valuable role. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in particular has improved substantially. For example: in-house publishing commenced in October; daily <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> are available by 9.30 the morning after each sitting day; weekly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> are generally available two weeks after the end of the sitting week; the electronic <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is available earlier on the parliamentary database system; and committee transcript delivery times have now shortened significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a personal note, can I say that in October, on the invitation of the Commonwealth Secretary-General, I was an observer on the Commonwealth team to the first multi-party elections that had been held in Zambia for some time. Without going into this in any detail, as I realise it is late, I only want to say that witnessing the peaceful transition through the ballot box of a country from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy was one of the most stimulating and exhilarating experiences of my political life. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to participate in this process, and I thank the Senate for allowing me this privilege, by giving me three days off.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr President, thank you for providing us with the details of the very lengthy sittings in the Senate this year. I was going to refer to those numbers, but I shall not do so. It is late, or rather should I say early in the morning of 20 December. The 19th of December was an extraordinary day, of course, for the Australian Labor Party and the Government, with the retirement of Bob Hawke as Prime Minister of this country, and, on behalf of all Labor senators, and I would hope some other senators, I would like to pay a tribute to his great role as Prime Minister of this country and his great service to this country in many aspects of public life. I would also like to mention Mrs Hawke who I think, if the expression is appropriate, has been a great first lady for Australia during the period of Bob Hawke's prime ministership. On behalf of the Government senators I wish them well in their future life and careers. Bob Hawke, of course, will be regarded by history as an icon of Australian politics during the 1980s. I say that 19 December was both a traumatic day and in some ways an emotional day for the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand this to be the last sitting day for Senator Jo Vallentine, who has served as an Independent for Western Australia since July 1985. I am sure that all honourable senators will join with me in wishing Senator Vallentine well for the future. The year was also marked by the resignation of Senator Paul McLean as the Democrat senator for New South Wales and his replacement by Senator Karen Sowada. I have already welcomed Senator Sowada to the Senate. I just hope that now she is as enthusiastic about the workings of democracy in this place as she was on the day she arrived here in September. This was also the first year in the Senate for Senator John Tierney, who replaced Senator Peter Baume as Liberal Party senator for New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it remains for me to join with you in thanking the Deputy Presidents, the Clerks, and all the officers of the Senate for the contributions which they have made to our welfare and wisdom during the course of this year. I also thank the Manager of Government Business, Senator McMullan, who took over the stewardship of that role from Senator Ray in June, and the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, John Croswell, in each case for their attention to the Government program and to the interests of the Opposition, the Democrats and independent senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion, there are a few matters that I also wish to touch upon. I agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) that 19 December was certainly an extraordinary day. We perhaps thought it was extraordinary in different terms from those in which the Government considered it. We think it is absolutely incredible that the Government would elect Paul Keating as its leader and as Prime Minister, but we have had that debate earlier tonight and we will not canvass that ground again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the coalition, I join with the Leader of the Government in acknowledging and recognising the work and contribution to public life of Prime Minister Hawke. We wish him and Mrs Hawke all the best for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you made mention of Odgers. I also recognise the unique contribution of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, the sixth edition of which seems to have come in for a great deal of usage in the short time it has been here. It is interesting to observe that it is already being used by Government senators when it serves their purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you also mentioned the television coverage of Parliament. I give credit to the ABC for being prepared to televise the Parliament, which I think is an important contribution to the Australian community. I mention the ABC radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ring the Bells</EMPHASIS>, and the new television program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order in the House</EMPHASIS>, which has done a great deal to bring to the public of Australia, in a new way and in much greater detail, the workings of Parliament. How the public will react to that is for the public to determine. Nevertheless, it has an opportunity to experience the practice of democracy in a way it has not previously experienced, and I think that is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you mentioned the long sitting. Certainly, it has been a long and arduous sitting. In fact, I understand that there have been only three occasions since 1970 when the Senate has sat for a similar period or longer. Of course, the sitting started early with the most important debate on the Gulf war, in which there were many significant contributions made by honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate in thanking a number of people. I thank my colleagues on this side of the chamber&mdash;Senator Boswell and members of the National Party, and my colleagues in the Liberal Party&mdash;for the contribution they have made, for the teamwork that they have provided and, if I might say so with respect, for the very effective opposition we have provided in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank you, Mr President, for your contribution. We thank the Deputy President for his work, particularly the Estimates committee work. We thank the Clerks, who have been helpful to all of us, for continuing their high standards of objectivity and learning. We appreciate their work. We thank the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff and all the staff of the Department of the Senate, whether they be in the Table Office, senators' services, secretarial services, transport, printing office, attendants, committee staff and so forth. Without them, this Senate cannot function. We appreciate the work they do for us and the work they do for Australia. I thank the people in the Parliamentary Library who provide a fine service, the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and the Comcar drivers&mdash;even if we are going to abolish their usage for senators when we get into Government. I thank our Whips, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer and many others who have made our work, I would hope, effective in the course of this last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that it is late, Mr President, there are a few comments I wish to make about the operations of the Senate during the last year. I mention the reference of Bills procedure which has very much enhanced the procedural operations of the Senate. It is contributing in a very significant way to improving the quality of legislation. It is interesting that, generally speaking, throughout the Senate it has been used in a cooperative way. The legislative process has been improved as a result of this new system. As I recall, it comes up for review in the new year. It is my view that, whereas it may still be in need of some further refinement, it is a reform that is well justified. It is in its early days and I hope that it will continue and be further developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you mentioned Question Time. Notwithstanding your comments&mdash;I think you thought the Senate was doing pretty well with the number of questions that were being asked&mdash;from an Opposition perspective, we are still of the view that insufficient questions are being asked and answered. That caused us to put down a new contingent motion in the course of this year that gave us the right to debate the issue that at least 28 questions should be asked and answered. We hope that, with or without the use of that contingent motion in the course of the next Parliamentary session, we can get to the situation where 28 questions are in fact asked and answered during Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sought to cooperate with the Government to produce a program that would enable us to get home to our families last week. Unfortunately, it did not work. The only lesson that I hope the Government has learned is how unwise it is unnecessarily to use the guillotine in this place. It was unnecessary and unwise in relation to the ad bans Bill&mdash;a Bill that was designed to curtail freedom of speech. It was a demonstration of very poor judgment by the new Manager of Government Business (Senator McMullan). I hope that we will not see the Government, in the time that it remains in office, try that tactic again. It was counterproductive to its objectives and an unwise exercise of power on behalf of the Government, in conspiracy with the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tabling of reports continues to cause us concern. We are most unhappy with the large number of reports that have been tabled in the last couple of days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, there have been 80 tabled in the last two days. That does not enable us to fulfil our function in relation to the scrutiny of those reports. We have started to use the procedures to call for an explanation and, hopefully, in the future persuade those who are responsible for these reports that it would be in their best interests to get them in earlier in the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One concern I should put on the record relates to this new practice of the Government of introducing Bills into the Senate by representative Ministers&mdash;in other words, Bills that are not the subject of ministerial control in this chamber. We have seen this as an attempt to avoid the cut-off date procedures, which have been working fairly well and which are designed to avoid a build-up of legislation in this place at the end of session. Again, therefore, there is an inability to properly scrutinise that legislation. We hope the Government, having tried that tactic this time, will not continue it in the future; otherwise we will have to look to further procedural methods to avoid it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new procedures we have adopted in relation to debating the appropriations in the Committee of the Whole still do not seem to be working all that well. The Deputy President is to put down a report from the Procedure Committee with a number of new options. I am not sure whether it has already been put down. If it has not, it will be soon. I look forward to the Senate giving further attention to ways in which we can improve that procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention two important anniversaries. One that was mentioned was the tenth anniversary of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It was also the twentieth anniversary of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Both committees, particularly through the work of their staff but also their senators, have made and are making a significant contribution to the legislative process. I commend the work of all those who have contributed to those committees in the years preceding the anniversaries I have mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind the time, that is really all I wish to say. The years in opposition are never much fun, but I am proud to say that the coalition parties are now demonstrating a unity that ought to be a lesson to this Government. We have fine leadership under John Hewson and Tim Fischer. Most important of all, we now have before the Australian people a policy program that can give them a clear alternative that can  produce jobs, jobs, jobs, some vision for Australia at last and some hope for Australians, which is more than they have been able to get from this Government. </PARA>

I am very aware of the fact that our parliamentary system of democracy&mdash;which is about as good as one can get, I think, although it has its shortcomings&mdash;does allow for people like me to get in here through our system of proportional representation. I think the major parties, generally, seem to have failed the electorate so dismally in the last few years&mdash;and that goes for both major party groupings&mdash;that there will be a greater interest in independents, as has been seen in various State parliaments around the country which are now dependent on independents. Local government elections also reveal that independents have a very important role to play.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in this Senate a lot of time is wasted on party game playing. That is one of the reasons for the great disillusionment in the community. Of course, we have seen an enormous amount of this in just the last few weeks, and other people have already alluded to that. I believe that far too much time is wasted in here by playing party political games and not getting on with the issues that are of importance to people in the community. I sometimes think that politicians are so far removed from their constituents that they do not really know how hard people in the community are hurting, or what issues are of real concern to people, because we spend hours and hours in here wasting time on pointless point scoring. </PARA>

Much of that is still relevant. I could still say, looking at my first speech, that we are spending far too much on defence and far too little on foreign aid, and that the United States bases on Australian soil are for war fighting. That has finally been admitted in the wake of the Gulf war. What we have been saying in the peace movement for years and years the Government finally had to admit&mdash;that is, that the American bases on Australian soil make a considerable contribution to the war fighting operations of the United States Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my great shame and horror&mdash;it was the most difficult time of all for me in these seven years&mdash;Australia was involved in the Gulf war. The same comments that I made about lack of sovereignty in my first speech are relevant today. The fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), without consultation with the Australian people, his Cabinet or the Parliament, could decide that Australia would go to war in that crisis was very difficult to take. I never thought that I would be a senator in the Australian Parliament with Australia at war. I think it is to our great shame that that war was entered into with such great gusto by the Prime Minister and most people in these two chambers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we had the special sitting in January there was uproar in the galleries. That was because so many people who did not support Australia going to war felt unrepresented by the people sitting down here on the red and green leather. They felt that their voices were not heard, so they made sure that their voices were heard from the galleries. I give them full credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems still continue because in Iraq at the moment there is a dreadful crisis looming that has been vastly exacerbated by that bombing and the war in January. It did a couple of things the United States might have wanted, such as getting the Iraqis to withdraw from Kuwait, but it has created so many more problems. I call on the Government to work assiduously for the embargoes against Iraq to be lifted. Children in their thousands are dying in Iraq as a result of the Gulf war. The problems are manifestly worse than they were this time last year, before that war occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, a lot has changed in seven years. Some of the changes have been good. It has been amazing to see the transformation of eastern Europe from one-state dictatorships to relative democracies. That has been wonderful to see. The breaking down of the Berlin Wall, which happened relatively quickly and relatively peacefully, was something more than most of us could have hoped for seven years ago. That has been a major change for the good. Unfortunately, with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, we have domination by the power of one. This is a very dangerous situation for the world, where the United States thinks that it has the mandate to go wherever it will, in whatever part of the world its interests will be served by intervention. That is still consistent with what I said in my first speech seven years ago; that has not changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing the Labor Party has not changed is the uranium mining industry&mdash;that is the good thing&mdash;which has not been expanded in this country. I am very glad to have been part of the ongoing campaign since 1978 to ensure that uranium mining is phased out in this country. We know that the end result of uranium mining is radioactive waste. Despite the best efforts of the Synroc team in Australia, still there has been no breakthrough in the disposal of radioactive waste. It is an enormous negative legacy that we are leaving future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, there have been a few wins on environmental issues. Since 1987, when I took on board a lot more environmental issues, it has been very pleasing to participate in campaigns that have resulted in some success, such as Antarctica being left free from the ravages of mining. That is something I should compliment both the Opposition and the Government for&mdash;the Opposition for coming to that realisation sooner than the Government. Once it was decided, the Australian Government pushed quite hard in international fora for Antarctica to be declared a wilderness area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant win was the inclusion of stage 3 of Kakadu on the World Heritage listing. Again, I must complement the former Prime Minister for having made a good decision on the grounds of Aboriginal spirituality. It could equally have been made on environmental grounds. Nevertheless, the right decision was made, despite all the flak that that caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some outstanding issues that remain include Aboriginal issues. We still have not come to terms with the original dispossession of the indigenous people of this country. Until we do that we will not have peace and justice in this land. It is an outstanding issue that must be addressed. I am pleased to say that my successor, Senator-elect Christabel Chamarette, will be following that issue assiduously. Having worked in the prison system, she is particularly concerned about the lack of justice for Aboriginal people. I would like to refer honourable senators to the deaths in custody reports, which should be taken note of, not only because of the deaths themselves but also because of all the surrounding circumstances that have caused so many of those deaths. It is an absolute shame and disgrace to our nation and it must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to admit that the economic system&mdash;we seem to have a Tweedledum and Tweedledee situation&mdash;in this country is not working. When I hear the Prime Minister-elect talking about growth and what we must do, I can share only one aspect of that, and that is that we want more Australians in jobs. Obviously, unemployment is a huge problem in this country at the moment. When we look at the GST package the Opposition is offering, I think the Labor Party has not used its best argument against the GST&mdash;that is, that it would be an absolute disaster for unemployed people. Obviously, Labor has not used that argument because it has presided over this growth of unemployment and I suppose it is a bit too embarrassing. But that is what the GST would mean&mdash;absolute disaster for people who do not have jobs and for people at the low end of the scale. It would do very nicely indeed for people at the upper end of the scale who can see some short term benefits. It is a very selfish kind of analysis and not one that is sustainable in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The already overstuffed are swimming in money while the poor get poorer. The trickle-down theory has become a cruel hoax. Money is the only commodity that flows uphill. It pours from the South to the North at the rate of billions of dollars annually. Something else that we have seen happen regularly in the seven years I have been here is the cut in the foreign aid budget. We are part of the problem of that money flow going from the South to the North instead of the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grass roots movements worldwide are increasingly focusing attention on economic matters because of the obvious connection with the accelerating deterioration of the biosphere and concern for the plight of the impoverished. Thus far, governments have reacted to these concerns with jargon-filled rhetoric and ineffectual knob-twiddling. There are no signs at all that anyone involved in traditional politics has the ideas or the will to make the necessary modifications to the economic system itself&mdash;a system which, as presently structured, demands that we rip the planks off the life raft at an ever increasing rate. I am talking here about sustainability. The present economic system is not sustainable in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the strongest argument for an urgent reappraisal of the way in which we go about our business arises from recent findings about the way the earth behaves like a living organism. I refer to James Lovelock's Gaia theory, which strongly suggests that as a consequence the implications of the chaos theory must be taken into account before all other considerations. This is because Gaia, that is, our whole planet, is not a steady-state system which, simply due to its size, is able to accommodate huge quantities of pollutants, but is a far-from-equilibrium system which maintains the biosphere in a way that makes it a place that nurtures life by means of a staggeringly complex range of bio-feedback loops working cooperatively&mdash;the same type of control employed by the human body known as homeostasis, or wisdom of the body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When overload occurs in the systems that function in this dynamic far-from-equilibrium way, the systems suddenly collapse chaotically, tripping into a new dynamically stable state, which in the case of Gaia may be one that is antagonistic to life. As Lovelock points out, the present steady-state increase in the rate of global warming due to the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may suddenly flick into a life-threatening rise in mean temperature which would persist for aeons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is conceivable that, if the perturbation was large enough, it may well cause Gaia to trip from the present oxygen-carbon cycle to, say, a methane-based system. The criticality of this homeostatic balance cannot be overstated. Take, for instance, the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere. For each one per cent rise in the oxygen content above the present 21 per cent, the probability of forest fires being started by lightning increases by 70 per cent. At a 25 per cent oxygen level, even the damp twigs and grass of a rainforest would ignite. That is only 4 per cent higher than the present oxygen content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gaian principles of cooperation, diversity and adaptability would seem to offer the most favourable basis for economics that will best serve the needs of both the person and the planet. In nature, small highly adaptable units interact cooperatively within themselves and as a collective whole to maintain the integrity of the system, in contrast to today's anti-ecological exploitative model. What has to change is the exploitative model of planet Earth and its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essentially nurturing aspect of Gaian dynamics is central to the ethos of the rising Green culture which stresses the necessity of a socio-economic model that places the rights of the person and the planet above the interests of the corporate state. As Elisabet Sahtouris says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our technology has ravaged nature and continues to do so, but the ravages of technology are based on our unnatural greed, our profit motive. There is no intrinsic reason that we humans cannot develop a benign technology once we agree that our desire to maximize profits is completely at odds with nature's dynamic balance&mdash;that greed prevents health and welfare for all. No other creatures take more than they need, and this must be our first lesson.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is very important that we come back to this. It is a challenge to the whole system. I realise that many people have left the chamber because they do not want to hear something that is creative and futuristic in thinking; they just want business as usual to continue. It is not good enough. It is not sustainable. It cannot continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall finish by talking about the spiritual renewal globally, which is part of the Gaian dynamic, where there is a nurturing of people and the resources of the planet Earth. It is happening. Of course, people here would probably be the last to know about that. It is largely dependent on women's spirituality. For far too long&mdash;for five millennia&mdash;women have not been accorded a proper place in society. They have not been heard. They will be heard. They must be heard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I would like to seek your indulgence and the indulgence of the Senate for a few moments to talk about an important issue. Yesterday in Question Time I addressed a question to Senator Collins with regard to Aboriginal investments and specifically those of the Gagudju Association of western Arnhem Land. Very obviously, he has not been able to fully answer my question at this time as he needs to seek further advice from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I look forward to receiving, hopefully during the parliamentary recess, the answer to the question I put specifically to Senator Collins yesterday in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I noted earlier today that Mr Clyde Holding made a personal explanation in the House of Representatives. I must comment on some of the points he made. In his opening remarks, Mr Holding said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the Senate by way of a question, Senator Tambling made serious allegations against me and allegations against members of the Gagudju Association, an Aboriginal organisation, and misled the Senate as to the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Holding went on to explain various personal matters that arose as a result of his statement. I certainly did include in my question a number of issues that required the attention of Senator Collins; the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner; and ATSIC with regard to activities by Mr Clyde Holding. I make no apology for raising those issues appropriately as questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Mr Holding did not go on in his comments today in the House of Representatives to outline any of the&mdash;what he calls&mdash;allegations against the members of the Gagudju Association. He does not go on in any way to outline how I supposedly misled the Senate with regard to the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. I contend that anyone who takes the time to read my question in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of yesterday will see that I did not make any allegations against members of the Gagudju Association and I did not mislead the Senate in any way with regard to the activities of the Commercial Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I raised with regard to Mr Holding related to his activities in what I allege was an unauthorised consultant of the Gagudju Association. In his comments today in the House of Representatives, Mr Holding said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are, of course, that for some years I and my family have `had skin' with two Aboriginal organisations, Gagudju being one of them. `Having skin' simply means that one has been asked to become part of a clan. One becomes part of what is a broad Aboriginal community and family group. This carries considerable obligations. It is an honour which I was asked to take when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I was proud and pleased to accept that honour. It is not a token relationship.</PARA>
<PARA>I accept that Mr Holding has developed a very special relationship with the people of western Arnhem Land. But it is important not to confuse those special relationships with patronage and, particularly, with issues where conflict of interest situations could arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst Mr Holding went on to outline how he had taken up an honorary consultation as a result of approaches from Ms Jessie Alderson, the Chairperson of Gagudju, he did not answer the question which I raised about his particular involvement in that regard&mdash;whether it was approved by the full association and the other people of Arnhem Land. Mr Holding did not answer the question I raised as to whether he was to be appointed a director of an operating and management company. He did not answer the question I raised as to whether he was travelling to that area at government expense. He did not answer the question I raised as to whether he is to become a director, under the contract that has been put forward, of an organisation that I believe he has pushed as a successful group with the Gagudju Association, a company by the name of Spirit Resorts Group Pty Ltd of Brisbane, which was formed on 26 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Holding also did not address the issue I raised as to whether the ATSIC Commercial Development Corporation had in fact proffered advice to the same Gagudju Association that other companies, principally the Australian Frontier Group and the present managers of the Crocodile Hotel, Vista, which also operates under the name of Four Seasons, had offered particular proposals with guaranteed financial returns to the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Mr Holding said at the end of his comments today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I leave it to Senator Tambling to explain, if he can, his public relationships with Aboriginal groups in the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to do so. I am a senator for the Northern Territory; I represent all of the constituents of the Northern Territory, including some 30 per cent of whom have direct Aboriginal involvement. I am also related through marriage to people of the same Aboriginal groups with which Mr Holding has obviously developed a special relationship. Many of those people have contact through the Gagudju Association and the other associations of western Arnhem Land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had constituent representations on this issue from members of the Gagudju Association, from other Aboriginal people in Jabiru, in Arnhem Land and in Darwin. I have had representations from various commercial interests which are connected with these very serious commercial operations. I asked yesterday whether Mr Holding had in fact written the various minutes of these meetings. That is an issue which needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted in the returns to the Parliament in 1986 and 1990 with respect to Mr Holding's specific interests that he makes no declaration of any interest or association with these groups of western Arnhem Land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry to have detained the Senate, but I felt that it was important to put these comments on the record as Mr Holding raised them today in the House of Representatives. I felt that it was most important that I address them this evening and have them on the record. Hopefully, with the information that will be made available by ATSIC, Mr Tickner and Senator Collins will answer the comments in much more detail during the parliamentary recess. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Political developments in the Soviet Union have resulted in marked changes to the trading environment now facing Australian companies. A clear conclusion from discussions during my recent visit to the Soviet Union was that much of the power and authority, particularly in the economic area, has moved to the Republics. This process has meant that Republican Governments and individual enterprises within Republics are now making many of the key purchasing decisions affecting Australian products. It is therefore essential that Australia strives to enhance contacts both at official and business level with the republics. During my visit, I used every opportunity to emphasise to republican authorities the merits of Australian commercial proposals in a number of key areas including oil and gas development, minerals and telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government continues to encourage Australian companies to explore trading opportunities in the Soviet Union. The uncertain trading environment, however, requires innovative approaches and sound entrepreneurial skills. The recent G7 Accord on Soviet debt provides some respite for the pressures on the Soviet external account, but there is a complex process of economic reform in prospect. The short term outlook is for dislocation, hopefully followed by economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vastness of the opportunities in the emerging Soviet markets will however be matched by similar levels of risk. Not only is there the major impediment of a nonconvertible currency, but major gaps in legislation and physical difficulties created by decayed infrastructure make successful business in the Soviet Union a challenge to the most experienced exporter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding this environment, opportunities for traditional Australian exports remain. Moreover, an essential element of the transition to a market economy is rapid improvement of infrastructure eg. telecommunications, food processing and storage facilities. Australian companies are already benefiting from this process, but will require substantial motivation to profitably manage and exploit these opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislative evolution currently underway should also facilitate Australian involvement in areas where we have a comparative advantage, specifically minerals exploration and downstream processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) and the Australian Embassy generally are devoting considerable resources to assisting Australian companies interested in trade and investment with the Soviet Union. Austrade has focused considerable effort in establishing contact with enterprises and Ministries in the key individual republics, and in the Soviet Far East, which is developing as a natural trading partner for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proximity to Western Europe and the existing level of activity by West European and North American companies in the European part of Russia and Ukraine reduces Australia's competitiveness in those regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Concessional finance is not used to support Australia's trade with the Soviet Union. However, the Government has underwritten two credit facilities to support traditional commodity trade with the Soviet Union through the National Interest provisions of the EFIC Act - The first provides $A 100 million in credit cover for the sale of wheat and barley on two-year terms. The second is a $A 400 million 240 day rollover facility established to support exports of wool and other commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These credit arrangements are currently guaranteed on the Soviet side by Vnesheconombank. How these arrangements might work in the future and what responsibilities Central or Republican authorities will have in credit arrangements involving the Australian Government are currently under consideration and almost certainly will require further negotiation. Much depends upon the future administrative arrangements that develop in this area, and the future role of Vnesheconombank and its ability to act on behalf of the various Republics.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Government's assistance to the Soviet Union includes a program of business and management training to facilitate the transition to market economies. The Government has allocated $4.5 million over a three year period for this program, which is an extension of the existing Australian Program of Training for Eastern Europe (APTEE). The Government will also contribute funding to, and coordinate, a joint business/government mission to the Russian Far East to assist with the chronic problems of the region's food handling, storage and distribution system. Australia is also a contributor to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which will be a major financial contributor to economic development in the region.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before responding to the specific questions, some background might help put my answers in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three quite independent issues which have a bearing on the questions raised:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in December 1987, a restructuring of the DSTO was announced to enable DSTO to respond to Government strategies announced in the policy information paper "The Defence of Australia 1987". The identification in the Paper of key capabilities and technologies required for Australia's strategic situation, together with the demand for an enhanced Australian defence industry sector were the key factors driving structural changes in DSTO. Reprofiling of staff to increase the number of scientists and research engineers and the transfer to industry of advanced development and full scale engineering were features of restructuring strategies. The new structure consisted of five mission oriented laboratories with integrated scientific and engineering functions. The Advanced Engineering Laboratory was abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in June 1989, DSTO made application to the Department of Industrial Relations to reclassify the 23 SES positions in its five Laboratories to Chief of Division. Chief of Division classifications fall within the Research Scientist structure which has a mandatory entry requirement of a Ph.D degree, or other comparable qualification&mdash;which may include significant research experience and achievement. The reclassification was sought in order to better align the classification of positions with their functional responsibilities. Senior man- agers in DSTO laboratories are primarily concerned with the management of research and must possess the appropriate technical qualifications to fulfil their functions. SES officers, on the other hand, are generalists with greater flexibility to perform a wider range of tasks not limited to individual Departments. The Chief of Division structure has recently been implemented in DSTO. It exists in the BMR and has for many years in the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, under the Structural Efficiency Principles, revised Professional Officer and Research Scientist structures have been endorsed by the Industrial Relations Commission. These reflect increased pay outcomes flowing from structural efficiencies and work value increases. Separate structures have continued to be maintained for Research Scientists and other professionals although, as far as possible, common pay points have been introduced. For example, Senior Research Scientists were aligned with Senior Professional Officer Grades B and A. Beyond the level of Senior Research Scientist, pay rates in the new Research Scientist structure align with those in CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning now to the specific questions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) DSTO Professional Officer Technologists have never been, nor will they be, debarred from senior management positions within the organisation. Bearing in mind that the function of a senior manager in DSTO is the management of research, Professional Officers who consider they meet relevant job selection standards may apply for Chief of Division positions. If selected, they would then be assessed for category transfer to the Research Scientist structure. Apart from those positions which existed in the former Advanced Engineering Laboratory, senior management positions in DSTO have historically nearly always been occupied by officers from the Research Scientist stream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is presumed that the question implies a perceived inequality in Structural Efficiency Principle outcomes. Under the Structural Efficiency Principles there was a requirement that all increases had to be based on demonstrated productivity changes, including any changes in work value. Increases for different categories were negotiated in the Industrial Relations Commission and granted on a case by case basis depending on the merits of the particular case. Professional Officer outcomes ranged from 6.1% to 21.3% compared with 6.1% to 19% in the case of Research Scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No, in the context of SEP outcomes. However, it has to be acknowledged that the loss of the Advanced Engineering Laboratory in 1987 did reduce opportunities. Three SES jobs, which were engineering managers, were abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As indicated in my response to Question 1, Professional Officers are not debarred from senior management positions within DSTO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. A feature of the 1987 restructuring of DSTO was the integration of scientific and engineering functions within each laboratory and these working arrangements will not change nor will any flexibility be lost by virtue of new salary determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No. Professional Officers do not perform the same work as Research Scientists. The classification of a position depends on a number of factors including the job of work required, work value and level of responsibility. Comparison of positions across different structures can therefore be misleading because of the number of variables involved and weighting given those variables in determining the correct classification of the position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The 1987 restructuring of DSTO placed greater emphasis on research with a transfer to industry of advanced development and full scale engineering. There has been no change in this emphasis and re-establishment of a senior management structure for Professional Officers as existed in the now abolished Advanced Engineering Laboratory is not required. As stated earlier, Professional Officers may still compete on merit for senior management positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The technology component will not diminish per se. DSTO will still work to the point of production of concept demonstrators; follow on full scale engineering development will be done in industry. Therefore, the products of DSTO research will continue to provide opportunities for development of the national engineering base. Within DSTO itself, since the 1987 restructuring, there has been considerable enhancement of the professional officer base within the organisation. Total Professional Officer numbers have increased by around 18%, much the same as for Research Scientists. Within the professional group, increases have mainly occurred at the upper levels, thus increasing career opportunities. Further, many officers are professionally qualified in engineering and the DSTO commitment to engineering is reflected in the significant increase (around 70%) in Engineer numbers since the 1987 restructuring.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I have seen the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian Weekly</EMPHASIS> report of 3 November 1991. It is based on the findings of the 87-member International Study Team which visited Iraq in August and September 1991 (known as the second "Harvard" report, released on 29 October 1991). The Harvard report, which has been examined by officers of my Department, makes clear the full scope of the tragedy which Iraq has brought upon itself as a result of its invasion of Kuwait, its rejection of international demands to withdraw peacefully, and its continuing prevarication over the acceptance of and compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions. The implementation of these Resolutions would enable the importation into Iraq of greater supplies of food and medicine to help relieve the undoubted plight of the Iraqi people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Earlier this year, the UN Secretary General appointed an Executive Delegate, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, to initiate and oversee the humanitarian relief program in countries affected by the Gulf War, including Iraq. This program, which has a funding target of US$460 million, has been well- supported by the international community which has so far (to the end of October 1991) contributed US$285 million towards it. Since the onset of the Gulf crisis, Australia has contributed a total of $8.1 million in humanitarian assistance to the UN and international relief agencies assisting victims of the conflict and those displaced in its aftermath. We have also directly supported the Kurdish people in Iraq by sending 75 ADF personnel to provide them with basic health care for one month, at a cost of $4.4 million. We will, in addition, be assisting children in Iraq through programs run by CARE Australia. My colleague, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, recently announced an Australian Government contribution of $400,000 for two CARE projects specifically designed to counter malnutrition among young children near Najaf in southern Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The UN Security Council adopted Resolutions 706 and 712 (in August and September 1991) to enable Iraq to export oil up to the value of US$1.6 billion over a six-month period in order to pay for foodstuffs and other approved items. A part of the revenue would be deducted to pay compensation (through a Compensation Commission established by the United Nations) to victims of Iraq's aggression, and to meet expenses associated with UN operations in Iraq. Iraq has not accepted these Resolutions, claiming them to be an infringement of its sovereignty. Australia is not a member of the Security Council. We do, however, fully support the action of the Security Council in adopting these Resolutions, and we would urge the Iraqi Government to accept them in order to alleviate the suffering of Iraq's civilian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The claim of a "billion dollar Gulf War profit" is presumably derived from a partial reading of a statement made by a Pentagon spokesman on 29 October 1991. While the spokesman said that the United States had so far received US$48.2 billion in contributions to the coalition war effort, against an estimated cost (to that point) of US$47.1 billion, he also said that expenses were still being submitted and that the total could reach US$50 billion. As to the rebuilding of Kuwait, the Kuwaiti Government is making good progress in restoring infrastructure. All of the oil fires, for example, have been extinguished well ahead of the original schedule. As stated in (3) above, the intention of the UN is that part of the damage caused to Kuwait as a result of the Iraqi invasion should be paid for by Iraq through the Compensation Commission. As to Iraq, its reconstruction would almost certainly be hastened if it accepted the UN Security Council Resolutions and got on with implementing and complying with them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) At its meeting on 21 November 1991, the Australian Heritage Commission agreed to defer a final decision on the listing of the Port Kennedy area to its next meeting, on 9-13 February 1992. The information provided by the Western Australian Government indicated that some development activity had occurred within the boundary agreed to by the Commission at its June 1991 meeting. This development may affect some of the values for which it is proposed to list the area. This information, and any other submitted by the Western Australian Government by 31 December 1991, will be assessed by the Commission before its meeting in February 1992. The Commission's final decision will be based entirely on the national estate significance of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Commission has a long history of referring decisions on proposed entries in the Interim List of Register of the National Estate to the relevant State or Territory for comment prior to the publication of the listing. This procedure provides a final check on the effects that recent changes may have had on places so that any necessary amendments can be made prior to publication. Once a place is entered in the Interim List anyone may then object or provide any comment on the place. The Commission must consider those objections, giving upmost consideration to the significance of the place in national estate terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Commission has deferred consideration of nominations and the listing of places on several occasions following requests based on sound reasons from State and Territory governments. In the case of Western Australia, the Commission deferred consideration of nominations in the Karri Forest region in order to obtain information on the whole region. This deferral led to the reassessment of that region in co-operation with the State Department of Conservation and Land Management, the results of which will be announced shortly. Similarly, consideration of the Hepburn Heights area, near Perth, was deferred to obtain regional information on local remnant bush areas. The Commission has also deferred listing a marine region to avoid public confusion with state conservation processes.</PARA>
