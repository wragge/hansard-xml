<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CASH TRANSACTION REPORTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill proposes amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 to provide for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reporting of international telegraphic transfers will complement the existing requirements under the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 for cash dealers to report to the Cash Transaction Reports Agency (CTRA) those transactions which are either suspect or involve cash in excess of $10,000 and for individuals to report the export and import of currency in excess of $5,000. The existing reporting system fills a gap left by the removal of a system of tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls which ceased to operate from 1 July 1990. The successes of the CTRA, as described in its recently tabled Annual Report have been impressive. The degree of effectiveness of the agency, still in its infancy, reflects the enormous good-will and cooperation of the financial sector in assisting law enforcement, and the growing expertise of our revenue and law enforcement agencies in dealing with the financial aspects of illegal activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure now proposed will assist in combating large scale tax evasion and organised crime. The trend in tax evasion and corporate crime is to internationalise illicit profits, and international telegraphic transfers are the principal means by which funds are channelled from Australia overseas. The reporting of the data to the CTRA will allow the easy collection, analysis and immediate dissemination to law enforcement agencies of accurate information relating to international telegraphic transfers of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1991, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial and Public Administration (Martin Committee) in considering the issue of international profit shifting found evidence of the perpetration of large scale revenue evasion, possibly of the order of $100-250 million, and recommended that a system of monitoring and reporting international telegraphic transfers of funds be implemented, with the CTRA responsible for the establishment and administration of such a system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Martin Committee has indicated that the capture and analysis of telegraphic transfer data would add a significant dimension to the ability of the Australian Taxation Office and law enforcement agencies to strike at financial gain which is the major incentive of international organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing reporting systems do not adequately provide for the monitoring of international transactions. This is a serious deficiency since it deprives the Australian Tax Office of an important source of intelligence in its efforts to combat international profit shifting to avoid tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some international telegraphic transfers have been reported to the CTRA in the form of suspect transactions. However, this is only the "tip of the iceberg" in international profit shifting activities. Telegraphic transfers are effected in a very impersonal manner without the counter contact which brings the staff member face to face with the customer in circumstances where he or she might notice something peculiar about the transaction. As pointed out in the Martin Report, because of the sophistication of the abuse of withholding tax arrangements, the likelihood of the associated transactions being reported through the CTRA's current reporting arrangements is minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of tax avoidance, the Martin Committee received evidence indicating that arrangements or schemes are operating in Australia which allow Australian residents to avoid their taxation obligations by paying 10% withholding tax instead of personal or company rates of income tax. Some of the schemes are extremely complex and difficult to detect, involving circuitous routes through various countries, including tax havens, and can often reappear as legitimate transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A feasibility study has shown not only the real need for law enforcement agencies to have access to information about such transfers to trace the profits of criminal activity, for taxation and confiscation purposes, but also that many cash dealers are in a position to readily provide much of this information. The remainder is transmitted by telex. While the proposed legislation will require the reporting of transfers transmitted by telex, the Government is conscious of the burden that this could impose on those cash dealers who conduct a high volume of telex transfers and whose systems are not computerised. It is therefore proposed to exempt those cash dealers from reporting telex transfers until the telex systems are computerised. International telegraphic transfer data is already in electronic form for transmission through the SWIFT System (Society for World-wide International Financial Telecommunication) and can be duplicated by cash dealers and transmitted on line to the CTRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said earlier, the measures in the Bill will provide a necessary tool for detecting off-shore tax rorts, which are believed to be flourishing, and for assisting in the appropriate assessment of tax liability. Conservative estimates are of revenue gains in excess of $37 million per annum. The CTRA considers that 85% of non-cash funds transfers are remitted off-shore through the telegraphic transfer system. The Taxation Institute of Australia indicates how a substantial sum can slip through the reporting system as it currently operates. One instance is where, for example, $1 million, perhaps proceeds of a successful drug importation in the process of being laundered, is remitted to a tax haven by telegraphic transfer. This would not be reported since it is not in the form of cash. In this respect the current system is narrower in its scope than the previous tax screening system. Lost taxation revenue may, in fact, exceed $100 million per year, according to the Martin Report, with additional lost Customs revenue estimated at $10 million per year and proceeds of crime at $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast the cost of implementing the proposal is relatively modest. The outlay in the first two years will be $13.08 million because of the capital investment in information technology facilities, but will be less than $5 million in subsequent years. There will also be costs to cash dealers, principally in the modification of computer equipment to duplicate existing data for transmission to the CTRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Bankers' Association and representatives of other major cash dealers groups have worked closely with officers of my Department and the CTRA in the development of this initiative, and I wish to thank them for their cooperation and support. This cooperation is continuing in the development of appropriate technology to permit the monitoring of such transfers to ensure the effectiveness of the scheme and its appropriateness to the practices of the finance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will make provision to protect banks (whether Australian or foreign) operating in Australia from any possible legal action which may arise in Australia from the banks complying with the reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also propose two minor amendments to the CTR Act: First to clarify the last point in time when a person is able to make a report to a customs officer when bringing currency into, or taking it out of, Australia, and secondly, to change the name of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and, the name of the Act to the Financial Transaction Reports Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill clarifies the obligation to report in section 15 of the Act. That section requires a person bringing into, or taking out of, Australia currency of a value greater than $A5,000 to make a report in a prescribed form to a Customs officer. An uncertainty was brought to light in a recent South Australian Supreme Court decision which held that a report could still be filed during a Customs baggage search without breach of the provision. The amendment clarifies this obligation by defining the last point in time when reports of such transfers can be made, namely prior to baggage search or prior to being given permission to leave the Customs control area without search for inwards passengers, and the point where Customs officers inspect passports for outwards passengers. Provision is also made in relation to persons other than passengers (crew, for example).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the name of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. This title will more accurately reflect the nature of the Agency's major operations since, particularly with the addition of the reporting of international telegraphic transfers, only a minor proportion of the Agency's operations will relate to cash transactions. For the same reason, the name of the Act will also be changed to the Financial Transaction Reports Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I stress that the country cannot afford to continue to suffer the vast revenue losses through tax and customs evasion or tolerate the removal off-shore of the proceeds of some of our most serious crimes. The average Australian is tired of seeing the high-flyers rort the system. The shareholders of this country are tired of seeing their investments moved off-shore, seemingly without trace and certainly beyond their reach, but no doubt to the personal gain of unscrupulous manipulators exploiting a loop-hole in the system which must now be closed off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 contains amendments to a number of Acts administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister and to Acts containing provisions which relate to Public Service matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 will make it possible, where the Ombudsman or the Internal Investigation Division of the Australian Federal Police is investigating a complaint, for the Ombudsman to refer a question to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an advisory opinion. The Ombudsman is already able to recommend to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police that such a question be referred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Governor-General Act 1974</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also amends the Governor-General Act 1974 to remove a limitation on the entitlement of the surviving spouse of a former Governor-General to an allowance. The surviving spouse currently loses the entitlement to an allowance on remarriage. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that a similar limitation in the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 is inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as it discriminates on the basis of marital status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three amendments are proposed to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. Two of these are administrative in nature, and are intended to bring the Office of the Inspector-General into line with other statutory bodies. Provision is now made for the appointment of an acting Inspector-General in the event of the absence of the Inspector-General or of a temporary vacancy in that office. A second amendment ensures that, should a person appointed to act as Inspector-General also hold a judicial office, that person may continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of that judicial office while acting as Inspector-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final amendment provides the Inspector-General with right of access to the annual or periodic reports of the intelligence and security agencies, and to Ministerial directions or guidelines given to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate of the Department of Defence. Although the agencies have voluntarily provided the Inspector-General with copies of such documents in the past, it is considered expedient to formalise access in legislation. This will further enhance the Inspector-General's ability to monitor the activities of the intelligence agencies, to ensure that they act within the law, with propriety and with regard for human rights. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 already provides the Inspector-General with the right of access to directions or guidelines given to ASIO by the Attorney-General.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment to the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 is intended to implement an interim decision of the Public Service Board in 1987 that a woman on maternity leave without pay should not become an unattached officer without her consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three substantive amendments are proposed to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these is designed to give the Agency flexibility in the manner in which it conducts meetings. It is often inconvenient, or unnecessary, for Agency members to meet in person to conduct the Agency's business. The amendment will enable meetings of the agency to be conducted by electronic means&mdash;for example by conference telephone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other amendments are proposed in consequence of findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in April 1988. The amendments will enable a pecuniary penalty to be imposed for breach of an order of a Disciplinary Appeal Committee or of a Retirement and Redeployment Appeal Committee prohibiting or restricting the publication of evidence. The Merit Protection Regulations enable the Committees to make such orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Ombudsman Act 1976</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of minor amendments are made to the Ombudsman Act 1976 by the Bill for the purpose of clarifying the Ombudsman's powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of these amendments will mirror the amendment made to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act previously referred to, empowering the Ombudsman to refer questions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an advisory opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the Ombudsman Act will clarify the powers of the Ombudsman by specifying that a claim of legal professional privilege cannot be used to deny the Ombudsman access to information, and ensuring that the Ombudsman's role is not exhausted by the presentation of a report to Parliament about an investigation, by providing that the Ombudsman may discuss any matter to which the report relates with the principal officer of the Department or authority concerned in order to resolve the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Public Service Act 1922</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes a number of substantive amendments to the Public Service Act 1922.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are being made ahead of action being taken to bring forward in due course a Bill for a modernised Act aimed at simplifying and integrating procedures and practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major amendments reflect the Government's agreement under the Structural Efficiency Principle to restructure the Senior Executive Service (SES) into three Bands and introduce the SES (Specialist) category. Other amendments relate to the role of the Public Service Commissioner in the termination of SES officers on probation and the extension of fixed term appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new three Band structure for the SES came into effect on 4 January 1990. One of the aims of the structure was to enhance the optimum use of resources by providing Secretaries and Heads of Agencies with flexibility in the allocation of SES resources and budget to meet changing priorities and issues at a particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed will enable Secretaries and Heads of Agencies to transfer SES staff across positions within the same band irrespective of the salary points involved. Under current provisions, it is necessary for such filling action to be subject to a full selection process, as the movement to a higher salary point in such circumstances is currently regarded as a promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1990 a separate SES (Specialist) category was established within the Senior Executive Service. Movement to the broad SES group from SES (Specialist) positions by promotion or transfer is on the basis of merit competition. The amendments proposed reflect the establishment of the new category and the role of the Public Service Commissioner in filling related positions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment is also included to enable the Public Service Commissioner rather than a Secretary to terminate probation of SES officers. This is consistent with the Commissioner's existing powers in relation to appointment, promotion and retirement for SES officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another proposed amendment will enable the Commissioner, on the recommendation of a Secretary or Head of Agency, to extend the term of a fixed term SES appointee to a maximum period of 5 years. Currently, it is not possible to extend an initial engagement where the period concerned is of lesser duration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the amendments relating to the SES, the Bill makes a number of other technical and procedural amendments to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Public Service Reform Act 1984</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also repeals a provision of the Public Service Reform Act 1984 which is unproclaimed and is no longer required. This repeal is in accordance with the view expressed by the Senate Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills that unproclaimed provisions should be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Statutory Authority Legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for the removal of the requirement for a number of Government agencies and authorities to obtain approval from the Public Service Commissioner for terms and conditions of employment for staff (or, in some instances, certain categories of staff only).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Administrative Arrangements Act 1987, the Public Service Board's statutory approval role became a role of the Public Service Commissioner. In accordance with the proposed administrative arrangements following abolition of the Board, officers of the Department of Industrial Relations are currently performing the function under delegation from the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment is consistent with initiatives throughout Australian Government employment to devolve to agency management greater autonomy, and to make managers more accountable for their actions. Nonetheless, all statutory authorities will still remain covered by the Government's general industrial relations co-ordination arrangements, which ensure the consistent application of the Government's wages and industrial relations policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 is to be amended to remove the Administration of Norfolk Island from the definition of "Commonwealth authority". The Norfolk Island Government is deemed to be a "Commonwealth authority" by reason of its status as an incorporated body. As a result, a decision by the Norfolk Island Government on a resource matter can be referred to the Resource Assessment Commission. However, it was not intended that the Resource Assessment Commission be able to inquire into decisions of the Norfolk Island Government.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first place, the Act is amended in the same way as the Australian National Railways Commission Act mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Bill gives effect to certain recommendations contained in the Second Report of the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force. The Task Force highlighted a number of serious offences currently within the regulations and recommended that they be elevated to the Act in order to highlight their significance to air safety. In particular, the task force noted that flying an aircraft without registration or a Certificate of Airworthiness attracted a maximum penalty of $5000. Such a breach constitutes a fundamental risk to air safety and the Task Force recommended its inclusion in the Act with a much more substantial penalty. The Task Force recommended that other more serious offences should be identified in the Act and maximum penalties be prescribed for each offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force also expressed concern about the Courts' powers in relation to a breach of the Act or the regulations. At present, Courts may only impose a fine or a term of imprisonment. Often this is not a sufficient deterrent. The Task Force recommended that the Court be empowered to suspend or cancel any licence, authority or certificate issued to the person under the regulations as a punitive alternative to the usual sanctions in serious cases. The Bill introduces a procedure whereby persons convicted of offences against the Act or the regulations may be excluded from any previously authorised activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill makes a number of minor amendments which clarify the Authority's liability to pay income tax and its powers in relation to statutory liens, and remove any legal doubt about the Authority's power to delegate certain air safety functions under the regulations to industry bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal purpose of this amendment is to enable the Commonwealth to transfer undeveloped sites which have been acquired for airport development to the Federal Airports Corporation and to empower the corporation to construct airports at those sites. This is achieved by introducing into the Act the concept of a "federal airport development site" which may be declared prior to its establishment as a federal airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a technical amendment which in no way derogates from the Commonwealth's primary responsibility for the national planning of airports, including the investigation of and the need for additional Federal airports and their location.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also clarifies an earlier amendment that the Authority is liable to pay income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Navigation Act 1912</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes a number of amendments to this Act. The most significant amendment places fishing fleet support vessels outside the ambit of the Act when not on an overseas voyage. Fishing fleet support vessels are presently trading vessels for the purposes of the Navigation Act, although the fishing vessels they serve are not. The Bill will correct this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An agreement was recently reached that in certain parts of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Area, certain types of ships must carry a pilot. The Bill makes provision for the issue of appropriate pilot qualifications for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, there are a number of other amendments of the Navigation Act of a general "housekeeping" nature. In particular, the limits of the Australian jurisdiction on marine casualty inquiries are clarified; certain offence provisions are brought up to date; and some drafting errors are corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendments to this Act is to extend the privileges and protections afforded to radio broadcasts of Parliamentary proceedings to, firstly, television broadcasts of proceedings and, secondly, to radio and television broadcasting of proceedings of Parliamentary Committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments give effect to recommendations contained in the recent report of the Select Committee of the House of Representatives on Televising, `The Eyes Have It'. The Select Committee recommended that the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946 be amended to provide for televising the proceedings of the Senate, the House of Representatives and their Committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also have the effect of exempting television broadcasters of proceedings of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and radio and television broadcasters of the proceedings of Parliamentary Committees, from the operation of section 117 of the Broadcasting Act 1942, which requires broadcasters to announce particulars of who authorised the broadcasting of political matter. This extends the existing exemption which applies to radio broadcasts of proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Trade Practices Act 1974</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974 provides shipping conferences with some limited exemptions from the competition provisions of Part IV of the Act. Among the various obligations imposed on conferences in exchange for these exemptions is the requirement to publicly register their anti-competitive agreements. Fees are charged to recover the administrative costs associated with processing such registration applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has recently come to the Government's attention that the agreement registration provisions of Part X extend to the freight rates charged by the conferences. This means that every time conference members change even one of their many hundreds of freight rates they would have to register a varying conference agreement. The imposition of such an administrative and financial burden serves no useful purpose as conference freight rate schedules are already publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will remove the need for conference members to register their freight rates and their subsequent variation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have already mentioned, fees are charged for administrative services provided under Part X. These fees are set by regulation. The fees currently charged are at or near the maximum levels stipulated in Section 10.90 of the Act. This Bill will increase those maximum levels to enable appropriate regulations to be made to fully recover the costs incurred in providing the Part X services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the new maximum fee levels provide scope for future cost increases to be recovered which will make it unnecessary to amend Section 10.90 again for some years to come. The Bill also provides for a fee to be charged for the registration of a change to the particulars of an ocean carrier agent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally the Bill repeals Sections 150-153 of the Act which relate to transitional provisions following the replacement of earlier legislation by the previous Part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974. With the repeal of the previous Part X in 1990, Sections 150-153 became redundant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CIVIL AVIATION (CARRIERS' LIABILITY)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959. The main purpose of the amendments are: to enable ratification of Additional Protocol Number 3 (Montreal Protocol No 3) and Montreal Protocol Number 4; to ensure that the Montreal Protocol No 3 passenger limit applies immediately to Australian international air carriers engaged in carriage to which the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol apply; and, to convert the Poincare gold franc limits of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol to Australian dollars through the medium of the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Right (SDR).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major reasons for amending the Act are two-fold. Firstly, it is considered that the carriers' liability limits currently applying to the international carriage of passengers by air are insufficient. These are currently around $14,000 or $28,000 depending on whether carriage is covered by the Warsaw Convention or the Hague Protocol. The proposal to ratify Montreal Protocol Number 3 and immediately apply its 100,000 SDR passenger limit to Australia's international airlines will go some way to redress this situation. 100,000 SHEARS, when converted to Australian dollars, is consistent with the domestic carriers' liability limit of $180,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has international obligations under the Warsaw Convention and is only able to increase passenger liability limits, without dissociating itself from the international aviation community (i.e. by denouncing the Warsaw Convention), by ratifying Montreal Protocol No. 3.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, since the abandonment of the internationally set price of gold in 1973 and the introduction of a fluctuating market price, there has been no agreed means of determining the Australian dollar equivalent of the Poincare gold franc and the courts have often called on the Government to resolve the problem. The conversion of the gold franc limits to SDR equivalents resolves this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the amount of passenger compensation encompassed by the 100,000 SDR limit may be considered insufficient, the Government is examining other options to provide equitable compensation to international airline passengers which will not affect the carriers' liability limits fixed by international instrument. This includes examination of the feasibility of a supplemental compensation scheme, perhaps similar to one under consideration in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Montreal Protocol Number 4 is specifically cargo oriented and introduces more modern cargo handling terminology and procedures, including the use of electronic data interchange (EDI).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the passenger limit of Montreal Protocol Number 3 will be applicable immediately to Australian international carriers, the Protocols will only become generally applicable to airlines engaged in carriage to which they apply when they enter into force internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my understanding that should the United States Senate accept the supplemental compensation scheme (called the S-Plan) referred to earlier, then it will support United States ratification of Montreal Protocols Numbers 3 and 4 by the President. It is also my understanding that this ratification may be accompanied by a denunciation of the Warsaw Convention. Unless Australia also ratifies the Montreal Protocols, this action could expose Australian carriers, particularly Qantas, to unlimited liability in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since it is our firm belief that US ratification of the two Protocols will lead to their early entry into force, they will in the not too distant future apply to carriage between Australia and the majority of countries. I understand that the US Senate may be voting on the Protocols in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a brief description of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol will no doubt continue to apply to certain international carriage even after entry into force of the two Protocols, the Bill fixes their Poincare gold franc liability limits in SHEARS. The Reserve Bank provides a SDR/Australian dollar conversion rate on a daily basis so enabling the courts to easily convert the limits at the time of judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gold franc limits will have the following SDR equivalents:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Warsaw Convention</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Passenger death/injury: 125,000 francs = 8300 SDR</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Registered baggage/cargo: 250 francs/kg = 17 SDR/kg</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personal cabin baggage: 5000 francs = 330 SDR</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hague Protocol</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Passenger death/injury: 250,000 francs = 16,600 SDR</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The registered baggage and cargo and personal cabin baggage limits were not changed by the Hague Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limits as fixed by the Bill in SHEARS are consistent with the move to ratify Montreal Protocols Numbers 3 and 4 with their SDR limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SDR equivalents of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol liability limits will apply to actions involving international carriers which occur on or after the date the Bill receives Royal Assent. Actions pre-dating this will still be covered by the current Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol gold franc limits, irrespective of the date of judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next the Bill specifies that for Australian carriers engaged in carriage to which the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol apply, the Montreal Protocol Number 3 passenger liability limit of 100,000 SDR will apply. This is consistent with Article 22 of the Warsaw Convention which permits the voluntary increase of liability limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally the Bill inserts two new Parts IIIB and IIIC into the Act covering carriage to which Montreal Protocol Number 3 and Montreal Protocol Number 4 respectively apply. These Parts will become law on dates no earlier than the entry into force of the Protocols.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For ease of reading, consolidations of the convention as amended by successive protocols have been prepared and included as schedules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will have no effect on Government revenue or expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to notice given yesterday, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the matter referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 19 June 1991 be amended to read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management systems and program evaluation procedures of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA>There are very good and cogent reasons for moving this motion. The proposition seeks to collapse the broad and vague terms of the original proposal that was placed before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration with very clear and specific terms of reference which are capable of precise assessment by the Committee for report and subsequent recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration works well. It works in a cooperative manner. That is largely because of the relationship which exists between the Chairman, Senator Coates, and the Deputy Chairman, Senator Watson. In order for the Committee to work well in this area, to undertake the responsibility which the Senate has conferred upon it, the change in the terms of reference is very necessary. The Committee will work much better in this area if the terms of reference are precise because it will enable a much greater focus upon matters of concern relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I will say a little about that and some of the progress made in a number of those areas in a very short while. Given that the focus becomes precise, in my view, the evaluation becomes very precise, as will the specific recommendations which will emerge from the Committee on Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take a moment or two of the chamber's time in this brief series of observations and give some background to the Senate inquiry. On 19 June this year the Senate referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration the following terms of reference&mdash;it is in four parts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management and operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and whether that Department is fulfilling its role to protect and advance Australia's foreign policy interests, with particular regard to the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)management systems and program evaluation procedures;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)security procedures and custody of classified material;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)overseas conditions of service and their implications for efficiency and effectiveness; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)morale, staff performance and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA>Since then, the Department appeared before Senate Estimates Committee B on 4 September 1991. The Department's appropriations were also considered by the Committee of the Whole in this chamber on 15 and 16 October this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also pertinent to add that since then we have seen a recommendation from United States Congressman Stephen Solarz for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. We have seen the success of our foreign policy initiative on Cambodia. These things are relevant when we are looking at a department which has a policy making function rather than being oriented, as so many other Commonwealth departments are, to a program of budgeting for a series of obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the Estimates committee process, at the Senate Estimates Committee B hearing on 4 September, Senator Evans raised with Senator Hill, the Leader of the Opposition, the desirability of reconsidering the question of a full-scale inquiry into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. To his credit, Senator Hill replied&mdash;and this is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that he would consider this and acknowledged that the Department had made considerable progress in several of the areas to be considered by the inquiry.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That positive initiative from the Minister was met initially with a positive response from the Leader of the Opposition. As I have said on a number of occasions in my brief period in the Senate, it is my firm view on matters of foreign policy, defence policy and trade policy that, wherever it is humanly possible within the chamber and among the parties, it is very desirable to reach a consensus view after the arguments have been dealt with in a thorough and responsible manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans followed up that conversation in September with the Leader of the Opposition by writing to Senator Hill on 17 October suggesting that, if the terms of reference for the inquiry could not be withdrawn altogether, a reasonable compromise proposition could be offered to the Senate&mdash;that is, simply to truncate the terms of reference to cover the management systems and program evaluation procedures of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Again, I think that was a most reasonable initiative for the Minister to take. It would certainly serve the purposes of the Committee and the Senate and achieve a better series of results. That process has now led to the motion that I have moved this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest there be any doubt, the view of the Government has always been that an inquiry into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is unnecessary. Senator Evans noted at the time the Senate was debating the inquiry's original terms of reference on 19 June that there was ample opportunity under the existing Estimates committee procedures to explore the kinds of issues covered in the inquiry's current terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if an inquiry is to proceed, as is certain&mdash;whether under the terms of the original proposition or in line with the amendment which I have suggested this morning&mdash;the Government believes the terms of reference ought to reflect the very significant progress that has been made by the Department in addressing the various allegations of maladministration and corruption and leaks to the media which were the background against which Senator Hill first moved to establish the inquiry. Again, it is fair to note that the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged the progress that has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of an eight-hour session on 4 September 1991 at which Senate Estimates Committee B examined the operations of DFAT, Senator Hill acknowledged, firstly, that there had been `considerable improvements' in the area of leaks; secondly, that the number of new allegations about maladministration and corruption had been `significantly reduced'; and, finally, that the criticisms of lax acquittal procedures within the Department had been `largely overcome'. From memory, on reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, Senator Evans made reference to Senator Hill's own experience. I add to that that on my return from Nepal I found the Department was very thorough, although very fair, in regard to acquittal procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been progress on the issue of conditions of overseas service, which is a part of the inquiry's current terms of reference. I concede that there are several outstanding issues remaining in this area but I think it is significant to note that it is no longer the subject of industrial action as it was in November of last year. Indeed, it may be of interest to the Committee to note that, with the exception of the 24-hour stoppage called by the Public Sector Union last June to protest against the offer by the Department of Industrial Relations on overseas living allowance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not lost a single hour in industrial action over the last several years. I think that is a useful point to make and to note. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since when?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last several years, with that exception I have made. With regard to the various allegations of maladministration and corruption&mdash;most of them made by a single officer of the Department who resigned earlier this year after he faced dismissal on eight counts of proven misconduct&mdash;an investigation by the Australian National Audit Office concluded that DFAT's processes for handling its investigations into the allegations had been effective. In fact, in all, 77 cases of fraud or misconduct were raised by the individual referred to above and by the anonymous and self-styled `Officers Revolutionary Council' within the Department. I, myself, find that to be an extraordinary title in an extraordinary circumstance. I am sure that a number of honourable senators around this chamber would share that view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 77 cases raised in this circumstance, 76 have been closed and only one is still with the Australian Federal Police. In no case was either improper or illegal conduct established; in no case was impropriety established. The one remaining outstanding case relates to allegations that moneys were stolen from the Department's social club. It does not impinge upon the Department's management or administration because the management of the Department does not control the social club, as I am sure people would readily appreciate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the Department's fraud detection efforts have not simply stopped with the investigation of these 77 cases. DFAT moved on to put in place strengthened procedures for investigating fraud, hard upon the claims that had been made last year and earlier this year. It has instituted a fraud prevention program aimed both at detecting fraud and inculcating high ethical standards among all of its officers. From the evidence overall&mdash;whether statistical or anecdotal&mdash;these procedures appear to be working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DFAT's fraud prevention and discipline section currently has 28 cases under investigation and nine discipline cases in train. I think that is a measure of the effectiveness of the action taken. The fraud prevention program is further reinforced by a revamped audit system which, in the financial year 1990-91, included audits of 27 overseas posts and eight Canberra-based programs. A very broad and effective net has been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing terms of reference which I find unsatisfactory&mdash;and which I believe the Government finds unsatisfactory&mdash;refer to staff morale. This is a very complex issue. It is also very difficult, if not impossible, to measure. However, I think it is fair to say that any analysis of DFAT's very strong corporate identity and of objective indicators, such as the number of grievances, absenteeism, the number of disciplinary cases and rates of resignation and transfer, all suggest that DFAT does not have a serious morale problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, sick leave rates are around half the Australian industry average. Resignations account for only 0.9 per cent of all Public Service resignations, despite DFAT accounting for 2 per cent of Federal Public Service numbers&mdash;all of this notwithstanding the stress, frustrations and disruptions which are an inevitable part of the nomadic lifestyle in a foreign service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, whatever justification there may have been in June this year for conducting an inquiry into DFAT, the situation today is quite different. Moreover, the existing and exhaustive Senate Estimates process, I think it is conceded throughout the chamber, will continue to provide ample opportunities to follow up any questions that honourable senators may have about the Department's performance. I think it is fair to say that satisfaction was registered about this during the most recent Estimates committee round of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all support the principle of accountability&mdash;the Parliament does and the Government certainly does&mdash;but we should also acknowledge that inquiries of this kind are extremely time consuming for all those involved and are extremely costly. They also serve to divert resources. They are costly in terms of time not only for the Department but also for the Committee and the relevant Ministers. Of course, overall, there is a cost involved which cannot be ignored or denied. If the inquiry is to proceed, it should therefore focus on those areas where, in my view and in the view of the Government, it could be most useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case the Government considers that if the terms of reference are not to be withdrawn altogether&mdash;which obviously is not possible&mdash;they should be restricted to the management systems and program evaluation procedures of DFAT, where I am absolutely certain the Committee will come down with a series of very clear and reasonable recommendations, given the nature of the personnel and the nature of the other inquiries which we have conducted. I refer to the ongoing inquiry into the Commonwealth Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inquiry along these lines will be a useful exercise in terms of public administration generally. It is not confining itself to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in its ramifications and applicability, not least because of the difficulty in devising appropriate evaluation procedures for a policy rather than a program focused department&mdash;a point I made at the outset. It would also enable the Committee to assess what we consider to be the significant improvements which DFAT has made to its management systems over the last few years and which are conceded at all levels in the Parliament and, I believe, beyond. It is for all those reasons that I moved the motion at the beginning of my address in the terms I outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes the motion. We do so because the terms of reference have been advertised. They were advertised on 26 August, at least in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. I do not know where else they were advertised. Submissions have been prepared by those with an interest in the matter and they are to be put before the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration under these terms of reference. Senator Loosley now comes in here and asks that we change the terms of reference, in some way further limiting them, contrary to the work that has been done by those who have prepared submissions. I suggest that that would create a most undesirable precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find more incredible is that Senator Loosley does this as an individual. It is not a case where the Committee has come back to the Senate querying the terms of reference or calling for a change in them. It is fair to say that he basically does it on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who is opposed to the inquiry and has been all along. That is not surprising; it is highly unusual for Ministers not to be opposed to inquiries into their departments. We have a situation where the inquiry is under way, has been advertised and made public and submissions prepared, and now one senator comes in and says that the terms of reference should be altered. As I said, that creates an undesirable precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosely has put his case in measured terms&mdash;and I appreciate that&mdash;although it is different from that which we would have received from the Minister this morning. Basically, Senator Loosely has argued that the terms of reference should now be varied because the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is performing better. Since the major public concerns were raised last year and since the terms of reference were first put down in my original notice of motion, which was far wider than that which was eventually agreed upon by the Senate, there has been considerable improvement in the performance of the Department. Therefore, the terms of reference should now be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that in some areas, at least from my analysis&mdash;and of course I am not privy to internal or confidential information&mdash;there has been some improvement, particularly in the area of acquittals. We put before the Estimates Committee that very large sums of money had not been acquitted, in breach of the regulations. When we were last before the Estimates, those figures had considerably improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I said to the Minister was that I think the process of acquittal should be looked at. The process is different in Foreign Affairs from, say, the Department of Administrative Services, which has a procedure much less cumbersome. It is embarrassing that senior Foreign Affairs officers have to go around collecting their bus tickets and so forth. There must be a better way. What I told the Minister is that the Committee can consider that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conceded at the time of the Estimates that there were now fewer leaks from the Department. If Senator Loosley looks at what I said he will see that I added the caveat that that was so, at least for the time being. Senator Loosley will remember that there was a series of leaks that were highly embarrassing to Australia coming from this Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One that I can remember related to a discussion between my own leader, Dr Hewson, and General Murdani in Indonesia in which the General expressed certain views on what was happening in Papua New Guinea and what he expected to be Australia's responsibility in that regard. It was highly embarrassing. The next thing is that we read about it in the press. A cable that had come from Jakarta to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade had been leaked. The Department and the Minister had not even shown Dr Hewson the courtesy of sending him a copy of the cable, yet we read about it in the press, to Australia's embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are others that I can remember without referring to my records. Singapore's allegations from DFAT cables on Singapore's arms trade with Burma is another example. It may be that that should be on the public record, but to get it on the public record in that way is highly embarrassing and creates difficulties for us in our relationship with Singapore. That country must really wonder how we do business in this Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said to the Minister, as I conceded a moment ago, that there seemed to have been an improvement. Since the Estimates, unfortunately, I can tell Senator Loosley that the practice has deteriorated again. There has been a series of leaks from the Department. Perhaps the greatest irony in this debate is that one of them was a leak of the Department's view of this inquiry and what the Department intended to include in its submission to this inquiry. We read that in the newspapers, including Senator Evans's pencilled notes in the margin as to what he thinks of the inquiry, which he had told us previously in any event.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That might be a matter of little consequence except that it was interesting that Mr Woolcott, the Secretary to the Department, did express the positive advantages that could come to the Department from the inquiry in which the Department will have an opportunity to put its case to the Committee. Apparently Senator Loosley in some way wants to remove that opportunity from the Department today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter will be interested in the next leak and, in some ways, I think he would argue that this should be on the public record, but I would say that this is not the right way to do it. Of greater consequence have been leaks which involve the Department's criticism of the way in which another Department, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, was dealing with the MFP in Adelaide. In this case we find a leak from a cable from Tokyo that DFAT was accusing the other Department of dealing with an important national project in a way similar to the Keystone Cops. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another leak came from the Department telling us that it had been told confidentially that the UNCTAD mission would not be commenced until next year. The next thing is that we read about that in the Australian press, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, on 31 October, to the embarrassment, no doubt, of Australia, as we take this information from the UN officers on a confidential basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 October we further read that Malaysia had ruled out any direct Australian role in settling the Spratly Island dispute, as a result of a confidential cable from the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. So something is wrong within the Department. Certainly for a while there seemed to be some improvement, but something is wrong. Why should the Committee not examine what in fact is wrong? How are these matters, of considerable confidence and importance to Australia, suddenly appearing in the press out of a department which says that it has tightened its security as much as possible?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the matter of leaks, which is included in the terms of reference, should be looked at by the Committee. The acquittal procedures should be looked at by the Committee. The important issues that have been raised with me by officers of the Department in relation to overseas allowances should be looked at by the Committee. The amended terms of reference as sought would presumably rule them out. I think the Committee should look at the unique procedures that the Department has for recruitment and promotion. The Parliament has a responsibility to look at these issues, particularly when departmental officers are complaining to members of parliament about the operations of the Department. We have a responsibility, therefore, to pursue these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Loosley pursued this matter in a measured way I will seek to reciprocate. My only slight divergence from that relates to his concern about the resources that have to be devoted by the Department to this inquiry. I would simply refer the honourable senator to the acknowledgments that appear at the front of the book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Foreign Relations,</EMPHASIS> which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has just had published, in which he refers to a whole series of Foreign Affairs officers who have helped him, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are indebted to a great many people&mdash;particularly from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;for contributing ideas, information and secretarial and other support.</PARA>

<PARA>coming from the Minister, that is interesting&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>He goes on to talk about his debt to the people in the Department for their contributions in producing his book. This is a personal book, his personal work, which he had all these departmental officers working on, to his personal advantage. Yet Senator Loosley comes in today and says that one of his arguments against this reference is that the Department will be put to extra work. I have just been reminded of another leak, the one in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 7 November regarding the joint facilities. However, going back to my previous point, the Department has had plenty of time to work on Senator Evans's private work, his book. The Department has the time to do this job, which will enable the Parliament to conduct a proper inquiry into the affairs of the Department, and this is meeting the Parliament's responsibility to the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Loosley, for reasons which roughly align with those that have just been outlined by Senator Hill relating to the concern over the precedential nature of changing the terms of reference after those terms of reference have been laid down and have been well and truly advertised. People have prepared submissions, and we understand that at least one submission has already been received. To change the terms of reference at this stage would be to set an extremely dangerous precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech Senator Loosley canvassed some of the reasons why the terms of reference should be changed. But, having listened to the honourable senator, again it seems to me that that in itself is an extremely dangerous precedent to follow&mdash;that a Minister or a Minister's spokesperson would be able to explain away the reasons for an inquiry which had been agreed to quite some months before in this chamber, without the matter being properly and independently investigated as it would be by a committee. So, to some extent, whilst we would accept some of the factual information which Senator Loosley put before the chamber in relation to some of those terms of reference, in my view the processes by which he seeks to have the terms of reference changed again amount to the creation of a potentially quite dangerous precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed new reference differs from the present reference in the following ways. First, it omits consideration of whether the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is fulfilling its role to protect and advance Australia's foreign policy interests, thus preventing policy issues being considered. Secondly, it omits explicit consideration of security procedures, overseas conditions of service and staff morale and performance. What is retained is an examination of the Department's management systems and program evaluation procedures. The omission of the first item would seem appropriate, given that consideration of policy issues is beyond the brief of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, to which the reference was ultimately given. The Australian Democrats have many foreign policy differences with the Government&mdash;and not just in the foreign policy area, a matter which was alluded to by Senator Hill&mdash;but this is not the forum in which to examine them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The omission of the second group of items is justified by several considerations. A spate of leaks which prompted the inclusion of security procedures and classified material has ended, as Senator Hill himself acknowledged in the hearing of Estimates Committee B on 4 September. As Senator Hill has just explained, while there may be fewer of those leaks, they have by no means completely dried up. Secondly, there is little concrete evidence to support the view that problems with overseas conditions of service are serious enough to warrant parliamentary scrutiny. Thirdly, the Democrats' contact with departmental staff suggest a high quality performance with no obvious morale problems, a matter that Senator Loosley alluded to, and we accept that. Finally, there remains some scope for those three issues to be considered under the proposed new terms of reference, in so far as they relate to or arise from departmental management systems and program evaluation procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are hinting at there is that, even with the terms of reference being maintained, it is well within the ambit of the Committee itself to limit the width with which it considers particular terms of reference, the extent to which it accepts or does not accept particular submissions, and the extent to which it seeks to call witnesses from those who make submissions before it, and accept further evidence from them. So, in our view, the better way to proceed would be for the terms of reference to remain essentially the same, but for the Committee itself quite clearly to take into account those matters which Senator Loosley and Senator Hill have raised. During the September Estimates hearing, Senator Hill indicated a willingness to consider narrowing the reference, and he has alluded to that this morning. As we have heard, he has now reversed that view or at least given a higher priority to the question of creating a precedent. Our inquiry suggests that there has been no precedent in the past&mdash;no precedent at all&mdash;for a substantive change to a committee reference. We believe it is quite appropriate for the Committee largely to confine itself to the terms of the proposed amended reference, but we believe that, as an issue of public trust and in light of the possibility of creating a very significant precedent, the amendment should not be passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Loosely for his long and detailed explanation. As Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I will endeavour to respond in the same measured and reasoned way as Senator Loosely put his submission to the Senate. From our point of view, the Committee works very harmoniously and does not seek to take overt political positions. Its report to the Parliament will certainly be in measured terms and will seek to overcome the perceived problems in the recommendations that will be put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the Government has introduced a notice of motion to amend the terms of reference applying to an inquiry that has already been agreed upon and for which a submission or two has already been received and for which others are in the course of preparation. I agree with my Leader that this is an unusual request. It creates a precedent that the Senate should be cautious of endorsing. Although it is unusual, it is understandable, given the attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, all along the line and perhaps more latterly, towards the terms of reference of this inquiry. To withdraw or significantly change the terms of reference at this stage would raise questions of what is to be hidden and who has got at the Committee. It is basically an attack on the Senate committee system, which I believe we should be wary about accepting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the terms of reference were widely advertised as early as 26 August and that we are now into November. We have to be careful that it does not lead to a degree of bewilderment out in the wider world as to why the Senate has suddenly changed these sorts of issues, who has got to the Committee and what is to be hidden. It is an unusual request in that, although the issues have been canvassed from person to person within the Committee, I do not believe&mdash;and I stand to be corrected&mdash;that this has been discussed formally and a resolution taken by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In hindsight, it may be that, had this approach been taken, some of the objectives Senator Loosely was looking at may have been achieved in another way. At the Committee's discretion, he may be able to achieve some of the focus, or lack of focus, that he is seeking as a result of this amendment. It is up to the force of argument that particular members wish to put. We are winners and losers in this game. I hope that at all times we look at the issues objectively and that, on the basis of evidence and reason, we take our positions accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to, as Senator Loosley said, `collapse the terms of reference' in order to focus attention, we would lose sight of what could happen. If we look at it a little more closely, this also implies that there would be an omission in the focus of the inquiry from certain areas which are considered to be fairly critical for the basis on which this inquiry was embarked upon in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of my rising on this occasion is to assure the Senate that, so far as the coalition Opposition is concerned, we will not waste our time in endlessly following frivolous allegations. It is always a concern when a Senate committee embarks upon a particular inquiry that sometimes whistle blowers and others who pretend to be whistle blowers wish to take unreasonable attitudes and positions and use the occasion to malign officials. We always regard such submissions with a degree of suspicion; naturally, we look at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will obviously wish to test the extent of the improvements that have been embarked upon, particularly those administrative arrangements that are alleged to have been tightened. Unfortunately, since the inquiry started, evidence has filtered through, at a level that is disturbing, which indicates that some of those administrative arrangements have not worked and that there are still problems in certain areas. In other words, the problems Senator Hill indicated earlier persist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, let me say that the Committee does not act frivolously, nor does it take overt political positions. Therefore, the extent of the focus, the width of the examination of each item of the terms of reference, remains very much with the Committee. I believe it should be that way and that goodwill and cooperation will ensure a good report. </PARA>

So far as I remember, I was told that the number of inspectors who were on reasonably long term or medium term workers compensation was 90.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Panizza is right to say that there is not a lot of heavy lifting involved in the duties performed by meat inspectors. But workers compensation is not related simply to back or other injuries arising from that cause. He is right to say that there are about 90 meat inspectors on workers compensation and, of those, 46 are short term cases, that is, on less than three weeks' workers compensation. The remainder&mdash;44&mdash;are longer term cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abattoirs are places in which when carcasses are opened for inspection there is potential for disease. Unfortunately, a number of the longer term cases comprise people who are suffering from some disease problem. As for the causes of the longer term compensation cases, there are 16 with back injuries, 10 are suffering from zoonotic diseases, there are several anxiety cases and overuse syndrome cases, and a sprinkling of other things such as hernias, lacerations and things of that nature, including leg injuries.

Overall, time spent and number of people involved in workers compensation have declined in the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that reply. I would like to follow up the aspect of disease in this sphere. I thought that Australia had pretty well eliminated the risk, bearing in mind the fact that the health of Australian herds is pretty good. In other words, I would have thought that meat inspectors are at minimal risk from contracting diseases from animals they inspect. Could the Minister give more information as to the sorts of diseases inspectors could be contracting, and what measures could be taken to prevent inspectors getting diseases from carcasses. I presume that meat inspectors wear gloves, masks if necessary, and take preventive measures such as washing and cleaning. Therefore, it surprises me that so many inspectors are beset by these diseases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the other aspect of back problems, which I believe are always fairly hard to discern, having mentioned this topic to various medicos.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could the Minister also comment on the matter of stress? I find it a little hard to correlate stress with workers compensation. I can correlate stress as related to long term sickness benefits for workers who cannot attend the workplace because of sickness rather than injury. I understand that workers compensation covers accidents and similar sorts of things that happen in the workplace, and diseases that could be picked up at work. But I thought that stress per se was a different problem removed from workers compensation and should be covered by sickness benefits, which should be borne by the social security operation or by the community as a whole rather than channelled straight down into the costs of AQIS, which is 100 per cent funded by the exporters who use the services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza raises an interesting point. I appreciate the motivation for his concern as to the full recovery of costs. It is a concern to the Commonwealth too that we provide a healthy and safe workplace for Commonwealth employees. Therefore, Senator Panizza is right to say that protective clothing, hygienic preparation and cleanliness are high on our agenda, and by and large on the agenda of individual meat inspectors. No-one courts an exotic disease that might arise in an abattoir; they are often debilitating for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that despite the best protective measures and the most safety conscious and disease free environment that can be created, unfortunately people still contract diseases. Of the zoonotic diseases which, for longer term workers compensation recipients, amount to almost a quarter of the total number, 10 out of 44, fall into three major categories. These are brucellosis from cattle, Q-fever from goats and sheep, and leptospirosis from pigs. All I can report to Senator Panizza is that that is the incidence of the contracting of those diseases by people exposed to them for inspection purposes in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of back injuries result from accidents in the workplace. If I have the question right, Senator Panizza is asking whether the injuries are real and genuine and whether stress should be included at all. Let me say this on the first point, as to whether these are genuine cases: in order to be entitled to workers compensation benefits, one must receive a certificate from a certified medical practitioner saying that a problem or disease exists. The disease must be traced to an event or an exposure which, for all intents and purposes, is the cause of it. If it is believed by Comcare, which acts on behalf of this division of the Department on workers compensation matters, that there is reason to suspect that the diagnosis by the medical practitioner concerned is not accurate, second and third medical opinions can be, and are, obtained to be certain that the problem exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that we lay people are, in matters medical, in the hands of doctors in determining what is in fact the case. Not being competent to argue with members of the medical profession, I must say that we are bound to accept their opinions, and I do. Often these things are so manifestly obvious when the individual is spoken to that dispute does not arise. However, there is the protection that I referred to if it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stress is a recognised medical condition that can arise in the workplace. It certainly can arise in the normal community. There is now a whole body of medical science available which considers the issue of stress. There are many causes of this condition. Often stress is related to the sense of responsibility and control which individuals have over their working life&mdash;whether they are, in fact, regulated by the rate of the slaughter chain and have no control over their daily existence and how that impacts on their psyche. Again, these are matters that I am not competent to discuss in medical detail as I am not a medical practitioner. However, stress is universally recognised in the private sector and the public sector and under Acts of Parliament introduced by both Liberal and Labor governments and, therefore, is an accepted element of workplace life. It is therefore a recognised category. Unfortunately, there is an element of stress in the working conditions under which our meat inspectors work and that is a compensable condition. </PARA>

As the Minister correctly said, if Comcare, or the employer for that matter, is not satisfied, a second or third opinion can be obtained.

But how can we determine the degree of stress which results from the workplace, family life or some disappointment in life? I do not believe that anyone should have to bear the cost alone. If stress is caused by the pressures of family life or some other non-work related reason, the costs should be carried by the community as a whole, not necessarily by AQIS or by Comcare, which insures AQIS. That is the point I am trying to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not labour the point for much longer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some general observations. If one accepts&mdash;and all of the evidence is that one ought to&mdash;that stress is an element that can arise in a workplace and that it can have damaging effects on individual employees in different ways, the question of compensation arises. Senator Panizza suggested that there ought to be some way of measuring the degree of stress that arises in the workplace and in community life. With the greatest of respect to the honourable senator, I am not sure that there is. It depends on the circumstances of each individual case; it depends on a qualified medical practitioner making an assessment, finding a link and thus making a diagnosis. I am not sure that we can lay down criteria, other than that we ought not compensate for stress arising from non-work factors. That is certainly the qualification within our compensation system. As I say, we are in the hands of the diagnosticians in respect of causes. But, as I have said, it is true that in many workplaces there is considerable stress which gives rise to problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have been invited to make some comments, let me conclude with this generality: the more articulate areas in the work force voice their concerns about stress more than the less articulate.

Therefore, we get a disproportionate view about where the stress factors are in the working community. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Archer (Hansard page no F43) asked "So that we can start off from the right place, the appropriations for 1990-91 showed total outlays of $35.707m and the actual expenditure was $26.164m according to the program performance statements. According to the annual report, actual expenditure was $26.203m. So there is a bit of an adjustment there for a start. Which one is right?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference in the figures has occurred because of a change to the Department's program structure and, in conjunction, a change to how certain administrative functions within the Minerals and Fisheries Group are apportioned against sub-programs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain administrative functions are performed within the Group by organisational units which are not directly related to sub-programs. Major examples include personnel services, financial management, accommodation and property management, overseas travel arrangements and human resource management and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to present a complete picture of resources within the Group it is necessary to allocate a share of the administrative resources to each sub-program. The basis on which those resources are allocated to the sub-programs within the two program structures is slightly different and this has caused the difference in the actual expenditure figures. In both cases however, the total actual expenditure attributable to the Minerals and Fisheries Group has remained the same and therefore both figures are correct in the context in which they have been used.</PARA>
<PARA>The best reply that the Department could come up with in justifying the fact that the figures do not tally is contained in the last paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both cases, however, the total actual expenditure attributable to the Minerals and Fisheries Group has remained the same and therefore both figures are correct in the context in which they are used.</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot have two sets of figures in two publications and say that they are both right: one is correct and one is not. I do not expect the Department to put this matter right this year. But next year I certainly expect that the figures in the annual report and the document that comes to us by way of explanatory memorandum should be the same. A few million dollars here and there may not be much to some people, but the figures must tally. I will leave that matter because, as I say, I do not expect to get any better explanation than the one that the Department has had a month to prepare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter is broader still: the presentation generally has not assisted the Estimates committees in their endeavours. In the 20 years or so since the Senate Estimates committees were established, they have been seen to perform an important role in subjecting Ministers and their departmental officers to detailed scrutiny and direct questioning by the Parliament. Before these committees were established, Estimates were debated in the Committee of the Whole for, on average, 42 hours. Today much more time is spent on the task of scrutiny. In the 1990-91 Budget sitting, Estimates committees met for 158 hours and the Committee of the Whole met for 40 hours&mdash;a total of about 200 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, this must seem to have been a step in the right direction. As one who has always been a strong supporter of the Estimates committee system since coming to the Senate, I nevertheless often ask myself whether the practice is coming as close to the theory as we may like it to. In other words, are the Estimates committees able to do the job they were set up to do? If not, why not? How can the situation be improved? I believe that the information and presentation should be better and the time taken to examine it could be reduced. Each year we seem to be provided with more and more voluminous information by departments for the Estimates committee hearings, and this in itself poses a problem: greater is not necessarily synonymous with better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, for example, provided 293 pages in the form of a document now called&mdash;for some reason not explained to us&mdash;the program performance statement, and 591 pages of a draft annual report. While I realise that it is better to have ample information than not enough, the provision of this volume of material is ridiculous, especially when much of it becomes available only the day prior to the first hearing. How honourable senators are supposed to find the information they are interested in, let alone digest it and formulate questions, is a mystery to me. We have to ask more and more questions. Inevitably, that means more supplementary answers and more unsatisfactory responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the contents of the documents, when I attend a meeting of an Estimates committee my early concerns are to get access to the answers to a few fairly simple, basic questions. The answers to these may or may not prompt follow-up questions. The basic questions with respect to a particular <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>program generally are: `Why, last year, was the allocation of funds underspent or overspent?'; `Why, this year, is the expenditure expected to be so much greater or less than last year?'; and, `Has the Department's efficiency and effectiveness improved or deteriorated, and how is it measured?'. Performance of stated goals is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the program performance statement for 1991-92 for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy&mdash;which I refer to not because it is the best or worst example but because it is a portfolio in which I have a particular interest&mdash;we find that for a particular subprogram an increase of over $24m, or 94.3 per cent, is shown in proposed outlays. This increase is considerable in anyone's language. The eight pages of text relating to the subprogram, no doubt carefully following the Finance guidelines, set out the subprogram objectives, who was responsible for the subprogram, what strategies were employed to meet the objectives, the performance indicators used to measure success, and the 1990-91 outcome, the outlook for 1991-92. In addition, there is even a section on compliance with the Government's social justice strategy. But nowhere is there a reference to, let alone an explanation for, the large variations in either outlays or revenue in the net program costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it too much to ask for a little less verbiage&mdash;much of which is available in strategic plans and annual reports&mdash;and more specifics? Could the resources summary table not be annotated in such a way as to provide brief but meaningful explanations for variations greater than, say, 15 per cent? I would think this would save everyone concerned a lot of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some evergreen questions relating to expenditures on consultants and travel. I know that the annual reports list consultants engaged, their costs and the program they are related to, but it would save us a lot of trouble in sitting down and adding up all the figures if consultancy costs could be shown in the resources table. There is clearly no reason why this should not be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and several of my colleagues also asked about travel expenditure and where we can quickly find out how much is spent under each subprogram. The answer was that this information is kept at a lower level in the financial system. Would it be too difficult to show such expenditure in the summary table to save the time involved in asking the same questions every year, to be taken on notice and provided later at additional cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I raised this matter with departmental officers during the hearing, I was assured that the papers were prepared in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Department of Finance. It seems from this response that it is not a question of ensuring that committees have the sort of information they want and need, but rather that this is the way the rule makers in the bureaucracy want it and this is the way it has to be done. I do not believe this is acceptable. The purpose of the exercise is to ensure that all senators have ready access to the operations of the Department in the form of a clear, concise and unambiguous statement, whatever the Department of Finance says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of this present approach is marathon sittings of the committees, at which much of the information has to be painfully dragged out of officials, sometimes because senators have been unable, or have had insufficient time, to identify the information they are seeking, and sometimes because the officials themselves are unable to answer questions from the papers before them. As a result, a large proportion of the questions are taken on notice, so generating significantly more work for the Department. Incidentally, I find it most extraordinary how often senior nominated officers have to take on notice routine questions on the policy, operation and/or detail of their areas of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), will pass on these points to the Department of Finance so that its guidelines for the preparation of program performance statements can be amended to produce documents that are more closely aligned to the basic purpose of the hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April this year the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration produced a report on Estimates committee documentation and procedures. Whilst making a number of recommendations on those specific aspects, the report also contained discussion on a number of other matters which I feel should be pursued. Possibly the most important matter was the comment in paragraph 5.39 of the report, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depending on developments in 1991 in the areas discussed above, the Committee might undertake an inquiry into public service performance reporting later this year or in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that this might be as good a place as any to start the job of bringing Estimates committee procedures closer to their full potential. </PARA>

The regions and the States happen to be the same&mdash;I guess this is building on Senator Archer's proposition&mdash;but the figures are very different. I cannot find any explanation as to why those figures are different. For example, the figure for the Australian Capital Territory, on a State by State breakdown, is $59,293,000; the figure for the Australian Capital Territory, by region, is $31m. I question why these figures are so substantially different. As I said, the regions and the States are one and the same thing, yet the figures are significantly different. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should acknowledge Senator Archer's contribution before I turn to what was said by Senator Crane. I understand precisely Senator Archer's problem. We on this side of the chamber often labour under the same difficulty. Senator Archer is saying that there is an immense volume of material, that one cannot always match the information one wants with the source of the answer, that it is a bit of a pain in the butt, one way or another, and that it takes a lot of our time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obviously reasons for this and Senator Archer alluded to some of them in his remarks. He referred to the Department of Finance guidelines about how these things must be drawn up; the guidance given to departments by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; and the fact that often we are comparing performances as set out in the annual report with projections for the Estimates. Some of the programs may have changed somewhat in the interim and, therefore, it is not a comparison of like with like. I understand all of those points. Notwithstanding that, there must be a way in which we can get to the root of these things. I sympathise with Senator Archer's view, although I must say the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is a very big department and I do know that the departmental officers strive to be as concise and direct as they possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, as recorded at page F80 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, Senator Crane asked that details be provided to him of the total expenditure and revenue received by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service on a State by State basis in 1990-91. There are differences in terms of expenditure over revenue. I think the basis of Senator Crane's question is the reason this difference exists. It is my advice that there has been communication to Senator Crane from the Department which answers those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane asked what proportion of the 1989-90 and 1990-91 budget was sourced by industry funds. Perhaps Senator Crane can indicate whether I am in fact answering the question he wants me to answer, because I am not entirely sure of the precise issue that he wants me to address. Rather than taking up the time of the Committee by going into these details, perhaps Senator Crane could briefly repeat his question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer is that one document sets out the expenditure and revenue by region. The other document&mdash;which again was provided in answer to Senator Crane's questions&mdash;shows the 1989-90 AQIS budget of expenditure; that is to say, the items that were appropriated for. The other is actual expenditure. So the difference is that one relates to appropriations and the other to actual performance.

I made some comments last night when the Minister was in the chamber about the performances of some departments in terms of supplying answers to questions.

I have now been advised that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy actually beat my Department in providing answers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basis of my question is the reservation by Senator Crane to subprogram 1.1. The Minister might remember that when the cattle transaction levy was first introduced I voiced my concerns that it was a change from a slaughter levy. In an answer to Senator Crane, the Department said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rates of levy for the Cattle Transaction Levy and Beef Production Levy were struck with the objective that producers and processors would equally share the cost of funding marketing and the industry component of R &amp; D. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I further expressed my concerns that the cost would certainly not be equally shared and that the producer would pay for the lot. There should have been a reaction in the marketplace to the changes in the levy. If the costs were being shared, the producer would not have to pay as much in terms of the slaughter levy. As I said, I do not believe that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Estimates Committee hearings it has been predicted that the cattle transaction levy will drop. As I said when the legislation was first introduced, I believe that a cattle transaction levy should not apply, for instance, to transactions conducted on a walk-in, walk-out basis where cattle never leave a producer's place. I am talking here about cattle that are not killed and processed but are just paid for and left in the same place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot remember whether the Bill has been passed but there is now a move to reduce the rate of the cattle transaction levy.

We get criticised for doing these things, but all we are doing is implementing the advice of the industry. I suppose we are big enough and tough enough to cop it, so we ought not to complain. However, there is a sense of unfairness in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This levy was the subject of some good economic news in that this is one of the imposts that have been reduced by the Government. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, made an announcement about that on 17 October&mdash;that is, since the Estimates committee stage. The purpose of the levy is to raise funds on behalf of the industry for meat marketing, research and animal disease control. The reason why we have been able to reduce the levy is that the BTEC program&mdash;the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign&mdash;has reduced in cost. The component cost has now reduced from $2.10 to 85c because we have had significant success in having Australia declared free of brucellosis in 1989. </PARA>

On 17 October Minister Crean said that he had asked the Cattle Council and the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council to review the operation of the transaction levy. The levy was put up to replace the old slaughter fee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has made a few pertinent points that I would like to pick up. Perhaps I can give him or his Department some advice. He said in the first place that industry suggested it or that industry wanted it. That is the problem in the cattle industry and in many other primary industries: there are statements from the Minister that the industry wants it. But who in the industry wants it? In the case of the cattle industry it was the Cattle Council, and I can say the same about the Grains Council and the Wool Council. Maybe the Minister for Industrial Relations is not responsible for this, but all Ministers should be looking beyond what the industry wants to find out who in the industry wants it. Is it all the people in the industry or only a few in the peak body, who half the time are not elected democratically anyway? That is the danger.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister has said, we have moved towards the eradication of brucellosis. That original cattle transaction levy&mdash;which changed from the slaughter levy&mdash;has not long been in place. Anyone with half an eye could see how the brucellosis eradication campaign was going. We did not get rid of brucellosis overnight; it had to be worked on. In fact, the Fraser Government provided some incentive towards it&mdash;I forget what it was exactly because that was quite some time ago. But there was an incentive for the brucellosis eradication program which started in the mid-1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems peculiar that the Minister should now tell me that suddenly we have got rid of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 September during the Estimates Committee hearing I raised a number of questions with regard to proposals by the Department to conduct a future development workshop in northern Australia. I understood that this workshop was to be held in October or November 1991. At that time I was advised that the financial provisions had not been finalised. Whilst the objectives were to look at land conservation activity, I am keen to establish what progress has taken place with regard to the planning of that project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister may recall that the questions I asked also related to the cross-portfolio references with the area covered by Senator Collins, as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, and the various economic and associated studies that Senator Collins had initiated at James Cook University. Has the Department had any consultation with the study unit at James Cook University? Has it had any more success than I in obtaining copies of the economic reports that I believe have been undertaken at James Cook University?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins informed me six or seven weeks ago that the report had been finalised and that a copy could be made available to me. My staff have pursued it several times a week since then and I believe they have been informed that only an interim report has been prepared at James Cook University. Certainly, on a daily basis we have been promised a copy of it, but it has still not turned up. Given the fact that I raised this matter with the Department at the Estimates hearing on 5 September, I hope it has also been able to conduct discussions with James Cook University. My questions relate specifically to the planning for the conference&mdash;when is it to take place?&mdash;and to what degree is there consultation between this portfolio and that of Senator Collins?</PARA>

If he is not happy with the answer I gave yesterday, I will give him another one today, but it will be the same answer. The first question that Senator Tambling asked concerned when the conference is scheduled to be held. The answer is that no firm date has been selected as yet for the conference. A date is being canvassed tentatively for May next year, but at this stage that is not confirmed. Obviously we would like it to be settled as soon as can reasonably be done, but it is not a settled date at this stage; it is tentative.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Department would obviously like to see that report because this issue under the land resources division is about soil conservation and it has been raised by the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee within the Department. Our participation in the seminar will depend a little&mdash;not entirely&mdash;on what that report says. </PARA>

Why does the Minister now say that the conference will take place in May when the program performance indicator figures that were put to us at the Estimates committee hearings suggest that the conference was going to be held in October and November 1991?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should correct an impression implicit in that question. I did not say categorically that the conference would occur in May; I said that is a tentative date being canvassed. Obviously we would like it to occur at that time. Senator Tambling asked about the reasons for the slippage in the old target date to the new target date. The reason is simply that this is a very difficult conference to coordinate. To get everyone together at the one time has proved to be an extremely difficult job. Therefore, one is placed in the position of going ahead with a less representative conference at an earlier date or projecting ahead to a date when most people's diaries can at least be reasonably clear and they are available. The key reason for the slippage in time is simply the availability of the representative key people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It concerns me that the Department is taking this view. I would have hoped that, in the normal Budget cycles, a conference of this importance would have taken place earlier in a financial year. It was indicated to us in the performance notes that it was to take place in October or November 1991. If the conference is deferred until May 1991, any recommendations that participants in that conference may well have arrived at would then have extreme difficulty in being processed through the appropriate forums of the Department in the Budget Estimates, even for the 1992-93 financial year. I hope that such an important conference would also make recommendations to the appropriate ministerial council for consideration. In turn, that would again cause further delays if it has to end up at a ministerial conference as well as be subject to departmental and government responses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that in northern Australia we have had a record number of conferences in the past few years. There is another one that I will come to on the agenda shortly under subprogram 4.1 relating to a conference held last March in Alice Springs convened by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Snowdon, but under the auspices of this Department. It made a number of recommendations with regard to transport. Other conferences have been held in northern Australia, in Broome, under the auspices of the Government relating to problems of health administration in remote and northern parts of Australia. All these issues do impact on the lifestyle and the industry of northern Australia. The constant deferral of these issues is a matter for concern. </PARA>

As I said, I will comment shortly on the transport ones, but again I highlight that this is an important issue. I would have thought that, with the Government's priorities relating to the environment, and particularly to land conservation, it would have been keen to have seen program and Budget activity at least in 1992. I am not really looking for any further response from the Minister, but I hope that the appropriate priority will be given and, if necessary, a big stick will be wielded in this regard to ensure that, if the conference is delayed until May, prompt action will then follow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to raise some matters regarding the Rural Adjustment Authority and to endeavour to follow through some recent announcements that have been made. In doing so, and because I raised the matter in Estimates, I recognise the problems being experienced in Western Australia with the Rural Adjustment Authority and, in particular, the situation which existed with the operation of part B. It has not been activated over the last couple of years at a time when I believe it should have been activated because it is an area where carry-on financial assistance is provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A well known syndrome of `Get big or get out' has been operating throughout the Rural Adjustment Authority in Western Australia. As I said at the Estimates hearings, that attitude has become, in my view, totally self-defeating. In 1986 we saw those so-called farmers who were the efficient operators in 1982 being forced out of the industry because their debt was too high. We are now seeing a repeat of the restructuring process of the efficient producers that went on in 1986. They were restructured to take the inefficient people out. In that process their debt&mdash;and, of course, their land&mdash;built up. They are the people who are, by and large, experiencing serious financial problems today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to examine part B, particularly with regard to the announcement by the Minister to increase the ratio of funding by the Commonwealth to $2 for every $1 contributed by the States. I certainly welcome that initiative. The Commonwealth is supplying the bulk of the money for the initiative; it is supplying all of it in parts A and C and a proportion in part B. I want to know, and it is important that it be answered, what action the Commonwealth will take to ensure that the States and, in particular, Western Australia activate part B. The Western Australian Government has been very neglectful in this regard, and it is not for a lack of representation by people like me and others. It has been very negligent and it must carry a lot of the blame for what has occurred in much of rural Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely crucial at this time that, if the Rural Adjustment Authority is to be in place and operate effectively, its sole role&mdash;as it has been in the past&mdash;of getting farmers out of the industry and in the process building up the debts of others, has to stop. It is just impossible with the current cost structures and commodity prices to service those debts for any period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking about this aspect of the Rural Adjustment Authority I note the announcement by Minister Crean in recent days with regard to the changes that have been made and the linkage to social security benefits. Senator Richardson, in answer to a question yesterday, made reference to those changes and some aspect of being underemployed. One of the problems in terms of a rural operation, particularly with stock, is that people just cannot get up and leave that operation and work in another job because of the necessary husbandry requirements of the stock. If that were to occur, the animal welfare people would be chasing them around in circles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the announcement was that these provisions will fit between RAS part B, which has been non-operative in Western Australia as I have already pointed out, and part C, which is the re-establishment assistance. Some of the questions that I want addressed in terms of this are as follows: how will the Commonwealth ensure that part B with the changed arrangements will be activated and not stay in the doldrums as in recent years? Under these new arrangements which will fit between RAS part B and part C, will individuals have to sign something saying that they will sell their property within a period of time or pay back the money, which they now have to do under part C?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of qualifying for this assistance, will they have to, as they do under part A, provide budgets going back five years and estimates into the future for five years? I do not have a problem with going back five years, other than that I believe it is a fruitless exercise because what has happened in the previous five years&mdash;particularly years four and five&mdash;does not really have much impact on today's situation, but to draw up budgets for five years hence is a totally fruitless exercise. It is an expensive exercise. In most instances the budgets will be out of date within a month or two&mdash;sometimes less&mdash;of the time they are prepared. While I welcome the changes to part B, my fundamental questions concern how the Commonwealth knows that it will be activated, and the points regarding its sitting between the non-active part B, and part C. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have specific questions such as those that Senator Crane has asked, but I want to make some comments regarding subprogram 2.2, which deals with rural adjustment and services. I note that one of the objectives is to `redress barriers to rural people's access to the full range of government and other social, economic and rural services'. This area naturally covers a broad range of assistance measures, including the rural adjustment scheme. Only last week we finally saw the Government providing some sort of adjustment to the scheme, and other social and economic benefits are to be provided for rural families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural assistance package announced by the Government has many commendable aspects, though it still amazes me that, with all the bureaucrats here in Canberra and all the task forces and committees that the Government establishes, it has taken until now to recognise the extent of suffering in rural areas. Indeed, the Government's own drought task force had reported 18 months ago but still the Government did not have a national drought policy, or even a definition of extreme drought or hardship. At that time the task force recommended the establishment of a part D to the rural adjustment scheme, to provide household support, equivalent to unemployment benefits, to farmers in extreme hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is astonishing to realise that the Government has only now appreciated that in various parts of Australia, and particularly in Queensland, we are in the middle of an extreme drought. Actually, the Labor Government in Queensland took a long time to come to that point of view as well. In some parts of Queensland and New South Wales it is the worst drought in memory. Already 55 per cent of New South Wales has been drought declared. Predictions are that 20 per cent of farmers in drought areas will fail. In my own State of Queensland, $500m of rural production has now been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of these depressing figures, the rural assistance package announced last week is for some, I regret to say, too little, too late in coming. However, the decision to offer social security benefits to farmers experiencing extreme hardship as a result of the rural downturn will help many farmers stay above the poverty line. I also welcome the extension of part C of the rural adjustment scheme, which will allow farmers up to six months to decide whether to leave their farms. However, I believe that the money that will be advanced in the way of household support should be by means of a grant rather than a loan. Indeed, the only way to fix the welfare gap is to provide farmers with either unemployment benefits or household support&mdash;but surely not another loan. I wonder whether there is any possibility of the Government looking into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also noted that the Government has recognised the way that it ruined the income equalisation deposit scheme. The Government needs to reintroduce some of the incentive that was present in the original scheme so that farmers can be more self-reliant in hard times. This is something that I believe to be very important and very worth while, particularly when we see so many people in rural Australia in financial difficulty at present. I am also pleased that the Government is still reviewing the natural disaster relief arrangements with a view to making Commonwealth assistance more readily available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these adjustments in relation to improving the access of farming and rural families to the various government social and economic services still do not go far enough. While it is fascinating that the Government has finally recognised the impact of extreme hardship on farmers, I believe that the measures that the Government has taken will still be inadequate. There will still be a number of areas that will fail to deliver in the provision of services to those from rural areas. As I said earlier, one of the objectives of the rural adjustment and services subprogram is to `redress barriers to rural people's access to the full range of government and other social, economic and rural services'. One area where rural families are still not receiving the full range of government services is in the provision of education and other facilities to rural families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am perhaps going a little beyond the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, as this involves the education portfolio as well, but I refer to the provision of assistance by the Government under the isolated children's scheme. I raised this matter in the Senate on Tuesday during Question Time, as many people in rural Australia are experiencing a real problem. In responding, Senator Bolkus did not seem to fully understand what my question meant. He did, though, give me a lecture on the rural assistance package. The Federal Government's refusal to change eligibility requirements for the isolated children's assistance scheme has already and will continue to force many rural families to withdraw their children from schools. The asset test provision for the scheme means that many rural families will not qualify and either will have to sell up, as is happening in many cases, or take their children out of school. I asked the Minister whether the Government would consider basing the eligibility criteria for this benefit on income alone. He refused to acknowledge that these problems exist and instead chose to give the Senate a lecture on the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Government's current rural assistance package, some rural families will now qualify for social security and other benefits. However, the Government has still not recognised that unless a family does qualify it will not receive any assistance for education. That to me seems to be a real problem. It seems that the Minister knew no more about what the question meant than the Labor Party knows or cares about the problems that are confronting rural Australia. Many farmers have assets but no liquidity. They are asset rich but income poor. They cannot say that they will pay their bills with their stockyard. Perhaps they could pay them with the sale of stock&mdash;if they had some stock or crops that were of some value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Minister seems to be unaware that many farmers are currently experiencing circumstances in which they have no income or even negative income as a result of the disastrous drought and the rural downturn. It is for this reason that I believe that the eligibility requirements should be changed to a test on income and not on assets. That to me is a very important point. With no money coming into rural households and with farming families being refused those allowances, many young people are being denied the same opportunities as those available to people who live in the cities. It is now imperative that the Government set in place policies that will alleviate the huge cost burdens faced by primary producers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Senate Estimates Committee, I asked a number of questions arising specifically from the conference convened in Alice Springs in March of this year by the Parliamentary Secretary for transport, Warren Snowdon, who is also the Federal member for the Northern Territory. The conference was subsequently convened under the joint auspices of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Transport and Communications. I have received a comprehensive reply to three questions I asked relating to the recommendations that arose from that particular conference. One of my questions was, `Will the response to the recommendations of the conference be tabled in the Parliament?'. I find it quite ironical that the answer to that question was, `It is not proposed to table the report of the conference in the Parliament'. Yet, attached to the document I have, which relates to that report, are the responses to the recommendations arising from the report. It is, in effect, attached to the answers that were made available to the Committee. There are detailed responses to some 24 recommendations and a further attachment of an additional two pages relating to government initiatives aimed at rural and remote Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So, in effect, an 11-page response has been tabled in the Parliament through the mechanism of this Committee, yet the answer given is that it is not proposed to table the report of the conference itself. I find that rather ironical and, to some extent, stupid. I believe that the full conference report ought to be tabled. As a participant in that conference, I have received a copy of it and it is an important document. About 100 people attended that conference, the majority of whom were public servants or academics from elsewhere in Australia. I think there were also 20 or so people drawn from interest groups or the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the report was an important document, given that transport in rural and remote Australia is currently on the national agenda and is a very important and major issue which will proceed to the Special Premiers Conference to be held in Perth later this month. It concerns me that the Department and the Government do not propose to make available for public comment a conference report that obviously bears on the whole arrangements affecting transport industries in rural and remote Australia. We are all well aware that there is a degree of controversy between the Prime Minister and the Premiers and also between the Federal Government and the State governments about so many issues relating to transport policy development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the 24 recommendations that have been responded to by the Government and the answers that were given to the Committee and are now being given to the Committee of the Whole, are any of those government responses inconsistent in any way with the proposals that are to be presented by the Prime Minister to the Special Premiers Conference this month? In what areas do they diverge from the agenda that has gone forward to the Premiers Conference? To what extent have matters of detail, which are to be determined by the Prime Minister, the Premiers and the Chief Ministers, already been, in effect, canvassed and addressed by the Government in this response before us?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is of concern that the Minister at the table is not able to give any information about the Government's proposals. The Government made this response to the special conference that it convened in March of this year. Yet this same Government, which is now preparing a case for major consideration of transport initiatives as a fundamental issue to be addressed at the Premiers Conference, is not able to confirm or deny that it is varying in any way the fundamental principles it has established in this response in the documentation it is now taking forward to probably the most important conference of the year, the Premiers Conference on 21 November. It is an issue that is of major concern. It again highlights what I was alluding to earlier when I referred to the other conference being convened by the Government on land conservation. The Government is good at getting out into the community and running conferences. However, when it comes to picking up and taking forward the recommendations of those conferences, and responding to them as a government, it is then not able to say what its policy will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indicative of a government in a policy paralysis. The Prime Minister seems to be wandering off with alternative agendas that are dictated by Mr Keating or other people at different times. I want to know whether a report that has been tabled in this Parliament in the last month in response to questions in September and to which the Government made a response is the consistent basis that the Prime Minister will now put before the Premiers later this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot tell me. The Minister is unable to inform me whether the work is consistent or in what areas there will be significant differences. What type of government are we dealing with? Where are we heading? What changes and impact will it have on the community? Remote and rural Australia really do feel the effect of the transport agenda, and that was certainly highlighted in the conference report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the report itself to be a very good one. However, the Government has chosen not to table it, only its 24 responses, but is then not in a position to tell us whether those responses are the negotiating items that the Prime Minister wants to present. I assure the Government that I will assess every one of those 24 recommendations against what the Prime Minister publicly says in the next few weeks and against the results and the consequences that he is seeking to obtain between the Federal and State governments. I find it absolutely astounding that the Minister is unable to give this Committee any assurance that the Prime Minister is being consistent with a Government response that has obviously been made in the past month or so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a number of issues on the Federal Airports Corporation that arise from questions that I placed before the Estimates Committee. These were commented upon in the report of the Committee as well as in a reservation that I expressed. On page 2 of the Committee's report, the Committee noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the FAC's management of Bankstown Airport, the Corporation was queried about its management of aircraft parking, the basis of its profit and dividend calculations, the gate access for Compass Airlines at terminal buildings, the application of parking fees, the progress in commercial leases at Darwin and Alice Springs, general aviation facilities at Darwin, its program to acquire works of art, the profitability of the airport terminal at Hobart and its handling of duty-free concessions that are tendered for at overseas terminals.</PARA>
<PARA>That paragraph refers to the general issues, about half of which were the ones that I specifically raised. I am concerned that I received what I consider to be a very inadequate series of answers on the issues that I raised. In effect, the answer that the Minister provided is that the Federal Airports Corporation has provided the following answer: `The matter is commercial-in-confidence and therefore not available'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question related to the extra charges for new lease sites on the northern side of the Darwin airport to general aviation operators as opposed to those they are currently paying on the southern side. Another one related to a request for a schedule of the names of the tenants and tenancies, the status of those leases that are signed and not signed at the new terminal at both Darwin and Alice Springs, and the third question asked for costs to the FAC budget for interest or other costs to compensate concessionaires for the delays in opening at Darwin and Alice Springs terminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that answer is appropriate for this Committee to accept. After receiving that answer, very early in the piece I said to Senator Collins that it was totally inadequate and inappropriate. There is an important point of principle of a corporatised arm of the Government seeking to hide behind an answer that it is an issue of commercial-in-confidence. If the organisation was totally privatised, I could fully understand the extent of that answer. But, given that the FAC is not, it still has a strong responsibility that it must honour to this particular Parliament. The answers are inadequate; they are insulting. They are not matters that I believe would in any way affect the commercial operations of any individual or operation that would be embarrassing. All of the information ought to be available and publicly on the record, given the nature of the public service that these important airport terminals will serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall be looking for a response from the Minister on each of those areas in more detail for the public record. I mentioned this to the Minister many weeks ago and I hope that he is now in a position to give a response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I raised, on which I have received some but I believe inadequate detail, related to the series of questions I asked about the remuneration and basis for engagement of Dr Battersby, who was a special art adviser to the Federal Airports Corporation. I asked for a rough annual Australia-wide appropriation for the acquisition of art for the financial years 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. I certainly received a satisfactory answer about the expenditure on art acquisitions for airports in 1990-1991, which was of the order of $370,000, and the estimated budget for expenditure on art acquisitions in the 1991-1992 financial year is $1.45m. That is an amount of money on which we can take whatever view we like as to whether it is proper, adequate or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard Senator Collins give complimentary mention to some of the particular art that has been installed in the new terminals at Darwin and Alice Springs airports. I accept that it is probably of a good standard. Senator Collins knows full well that I had hoped previously that there would have been more local content and local involvement in the choice of that art for the respective terminals in Darwin and Alice Springs. However, I believe that the FAC has avoided answering the question relating to the remuneration of Dr Battersby, and I believe that there is no commercial confidentiality with regard to a consultancy of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To hide behind commercial-in-confidence in regard to the provision of the fees paid to Dr Battersby again links up with those previous questions for which I received a totally inappropriate and inadequate answer. I look to Senator Collins to provide that detail with regard to the full contract and financial details for Dr Battersby. </PARA>

I would have thought that he would have had a bit more sensitivity to the individual concerns of the concessionaires themselves. That is where my concern and the FAC's concern are in terms of having its business dealings laid out publicly.

Having said that, I can assure Senator Tambling that when he looks at these lists he will see that some of this information is sensitive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I bring before the Senate a matter that I consider to be of extreme interest to people in Australia: the extraordinary comments made by Senator Graham Richardson this morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> news program. This matter is of great importance to the people of Australia because it demonstrates the cause of the inertia and the paralysis that presently confront this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is unable to govern. It is unable to do what it was elected to do, because it is completely absorbed by the contest between Mr Keating and Mr Hawke for the prime ministership of Australia. It is absolutely extraordinary that that should be going on at this time. There are almost one million Australians out of work, and all this Government can do is fight about who should be the Prime Minister for the next few months until an election is called, when Dr Hewson will take over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the extraordinary attacks by Senator Richardson on those people constituting the present Government of Queensland. This morning, Senator Richardson said about the people that now run the Government of Queensland:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will recall that one little conference of the Party in Surfers Paradise, more famed for the amount of booze that could be drunk per delegate than for any decision that was made. And the average was pretty high, because some of the players were pretty fantastic. The Queensland delegation actually distinguished themselves in an extraordinary matter. It was even too much for Egdo, he had to replace half of them after the last two days.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a disgraceful commentary on the Queensland Labor Party and the people in it who are now holding positions of power in the Government of Queensland. I find that sort of comment on the Queensland Government quite inexcusable. Even though it is a Labor government, I find it an insult to the people of Queensland that Senator Richardson should say that about the people who make up the present Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is outrageous that Senator Richardson should paint the Deputy Premier of Queensland as a racial bigot. That is what he did this morning. He called him a racial bigot. He said in this interview this morning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it was only in 1988 when Tom Burns stood at the rear of the hall, in a meeting of a group formed in Surfers Paradise to oppose, not foreign investment, but Japanese investment. He said that he had been, `ranting' was the word he used, about Japanese investment for 15 years, and he was delighted that public opinion had finally caught up with his views.</PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Richardson had painted Mr Burns as a racial bigot.</PARA>
<PARA>Then Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was the kind of vision with which Tom Burns was associated.</PARA>
<PARA>That sort of stuff should not be allowed to go on in the governments of Australia. The ABC interviewer said today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Mr Burns, the Queensland Deputy Premier, and Mr Ian McLean, a Federal Vice-President&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is a Minister in the Queensland Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have angered the Keating camp with their calls for the Treasurer to be disciplined. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson then went on to belittle those two members of the Queensland Government. He said this about Mr McLean:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eyes of my two Left colleagues on that trip opened wide as they saw the grand socialist vision, the 30-foot high bronzed statues of the great leader.

This is the same man who campaigned for six months on the question of privatisation last year. You could not turn on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> without Ian McLean threatening parliamentary members of the Party with disciplinary action if they dared to vote against his views.</PARA>

Quite accurately, he continues to blame Mr Keating, and the Cabinet of which he was a member, for creating the high interest rates and the unemployment. They are not words of political rhetoric that I am using from an opposition point of view, or from a point of view of political opposition to the Government; they are the words of the Deputy Premier of a State government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McLean, who was also defamed and accused quite roundly by Senator Richardson, responded with his attack on the New South Wales Right. I will read that into the record as well. Mr McLean says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the New South Wales Right and they have had a long period of success on the back of Neville Wran, but in recent years they've anointed various of their club and they've charged ahead, irrespective of the damage that might be done to the Party or to the respective Government's. They did that with Barry Unsworth. I think their arrogance through the whole of the Unsworth thing lead to the disaster that they had electorally and the workers of NSW are suffering for that now. They did the same thing with Stephen Loosley at the National Conference on the question of the Presidency instead of adopting a compromise candidate.

<PARA>That is disgraceful stuff. That is the stuff that this Government, and the Labor Party senators in this chamber, are concerned about.

It is about who is going to be the leader of a crumbling, failing government. That is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Queenslander I have been concerned for some time&mdash;and I have said it in this chamber&mdash;at the number of Queenslanders in the Hawke Ministry. It is of concern to Queenslanders. I accept that Ministers should be appointed on merit, not because they come from a geographic part of our nation. By the same token, I consider that there are people in the ALP in Queensland who are equally as good as the people in the ALP in Victoria or the ALP in New South Wales, or even the Northern Territory. There is no Queenslander in Cabinet at all. Why Queenslanders have such a minuscule representation in the Federal Ministry is something that I have always been concerned about. It reacts badly on the State of Queensland. When we have 11 Ministers coming from the State of Victoria and only 2 1/2 from Queensland, we can be assured that the Victorian view and the Victorian problems&mdash;and they have plenty of them&mdash;receive greater consideration and greater interest from this Government because of their sheer numbers in the Ministry. </PARA>

It is turning into a battle royal between the Queensland Labor members who are excluded from the Ministry and who, almost to a man, support Mr Hawke in the contest for the leadership&mdash;with a couple of exceptions&mdash;and the New South Wales Right and the people in New South Wales who are supporting Mr Keating in his leadership challenge. That is what it is all about. That is why Senator Richardson is so determined to denigrate the Queensland Labor people and the Queensland Deputy Premier. Senator Collins may have an interest in it as well. It may well be that he is frightened of losing his job if they put people with some competence into the Ministry. He would probably be the first to go. The Minister&mdash;not because Caucus wanted him or that he had any ability&mdash;is only there because Mr Hawke wanted him there to pay back a favour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a subject of considerable importance in terms of propriety of government and of economic policy setting. It is a subject which has received insufficient consideration in this place over recent months. I refer to two or three extremely important articles by Laura Tingle in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> over recent weeks. In an article this week, on Monday, 4 November, she asserts that the Federal Government tried to circumvent formal monetary policy-making processes before the last policy change in September. The article is referring to what was the last interest rate change at the time this article was written and it asserts that the Government placed intense pressure on the Reserve Bank to cut rates before the bank Board had met to discuss the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very serious claim by Laura Tingle and, to my knowledge, there has been no denial by the Government, by either the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), of the accuracy of that story. Indeed, the thinking behind it has been confirmed, I would have thought, by the decision this week of the Reserve Bank Board to lower the interest rates as of yesterday by 1 per cent. That was a decision that was taken by the Reserve Bank Board on Tuesday, of course, but it was taken after many days of speculating by the Prime Minister, by his Ministers, by leaders of the ACTU, in my view absolutely improperly, about interest rates. The speculation gave the strongest implication that interest rates would be cut at that Board meeting earlier this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I find it extraordinary that the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, should have indulged in such improper speculation in the light of the fact that he is a member of the Reserve Bank Board. I find it totally improper for a member of the Reserve Bank Board to be speculating in the way that Mr Kelty did in the days leading up to this week's Reserve Bank Board meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But my main purpose today is to come back to what happened in September with the reduction in the interest rates that was announced by the Reserve Bank after its Board meeting on 3 September. In the House of Representatives on that day the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, said, on the subject of monetary policy, that when he became Treasurer there were two things that he was very clear about concerning interest rates: the first was that he was not going to overreact to one month's figures; the second was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that I was intent on making sure that due process occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>All the evidence to date suggests that due process was flagrantly flaunted by the Treasurer and by the Prime Minister on the very day before the Treasurer made that statement in the House of Representatives. According to the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a report which, to my knowledge, has not in any way been denied&mdash;the Treasurer, acting on pressure from the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's advisers, rang the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, and put it to him that rates should be lowered. Apparently, he asked Mr Fraser what would happen if he, the Treasurer, directed the bank to cut rates. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fraser, to his credit, apparently replied in the strongest possible terms in opposition to that proposal, because the bank has a standing rule that it will observe due process when it comes to the setting of monetary policy. There is a longstanding convention&mdash;indeed it is perhaps more than a convention&mdash;that the Reserve Bank will only make changes to interest rates after proper process and after all the formalities of policy-making have been followed. That includes a standing decision by the Reserve Bank Board that rates not be cut ahead of meetings of the Board and that it is the proper process of the Reserve Bank Board to consider whether rates should be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allegation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> raises very serious issues indeed. It raises issues of the gravest significance in terms of the role of the Prime Minister in trying to deliberately circumvent the proper processes of monetary policy setting. One will recall that the Prime Minister was under considerable pressure at that time from his Caucus to do something about the economic situation. He was facing considerable pressure in the Caucus meeting of that week and he wanted to demonstrate to Caucus that the Government was acting by easing monetary policy. That was the reason why he pressured Mr Kerin to put pressure on the Reserve Bank to circumvent the normal processes and accept standards of monetary policy-making to cut the rates without going through the normal Reserve Bank Board meeting process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is playing politics with monetary policy and with the economy, par excellence. Perhaps we should not be surprised about that. We have seen nothing but such opportunistic, populist, internal Labor Party division-ridden, economic policy-making for months and months. That is one of the fundamental reasons why this country is in the desperate state that it is in, with unemployment again today showing massive levels, employment having fallen, people having dropped out of the process of looking for jobs, with a further fall in the participation rate. They are matters on which I am sure my colleagues, in particular Senator Michael Baume, will be speaking later today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the very reasons why we have the desperate economic situation and the tragedy and hardship for more than one million who are on the unemployment heap that we have in this country. If we are to get away from the proper processes and the proper conduct of monetary policy, that is a very damaging situation for this nation. It heightens again the importance of having a Reserve Bank that is independent of the government of the day. That is why the coalition has, in statements over the last year or more, laid so much stress on the need to increase the independence of the Reserve Bank, to cut the ties between the Reserve Bank and the Government, so that there is no prospect of a repeat of this disgraceful type of performance that apparently occurred prior to the September Board meeting of the Reserve Bank. As I say, this was done for purely internal Labor Party political reasons. If it had not been for the Governor of the Reserve Bank reacting very properly and very strongly to the actions of the Treasurer or, through him, the Prime Minister, we could have seen very much a violation of the proper processes of the formulation of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent on the Government to answer this question raised by the article by Laura Tingle in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Monday this week. It follows a similar type of article she had in the paper a month earlier. The question to be answered is: are those articles alleging impropriety on the part of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer correct or are they not correct? It requires one simple answer on the part of the Prime Minister or the Treasurer if they are incorrect, but not one word has come from the Government, since the articles first appeared in early October, to in any way suggest that those allegations are incorrect. If those allegations are correct, I believe that is a matter of very grave significance for this country, because it once again puts the formulation of economic policy and the manipulation of economic policy and monetary policy and interest rate policy in the hands of a government which has shown that it is unfit to manage and to govern this country. I fully endorse the conclusion to be drawn, if those allegations are correct, from these articles by Laura Tingle. I quote:</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment relates to the age discrimination element, which is being removed by Opposition amendments. The Government was also seeking to remove it by similar amendments. This particular amendment has a difficulty for the Government, in so far as it applies to the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Under our amendment all people on the board of that Agency, including the Chairman, would have been exempted from the requirement to retire at 65. The Minister has told me that he has a concern, in that it is possible under the Australian Sports Drug Agency legislation to have a full time executive chairman. It is not in the spirit of the amendments that the Opposition has been moving for full time executive chairmen to be excused from retirement at 65, whereas normal board members would be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the remarks of my colleague Senator Baume with regard to the Australian Sports Drug Agency, I make the point that it is unacceptable to the coalition to maintain age discrimination in any form. When we debated this issue a couple of weeks ago, the Government responded that in terms of non-executive chairmen it was accepting our position on age discrimination, but as far as executive positions&mdash;executive officers&mdash;were concerned, it would not accept the arguments and the proposed amendments of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this in itself, apart from being a blatant continuation of unjustified age discrimination, is inconsistent with the Public Service Act itself, which allows public servants to stay on in their jobs beyond the age of 65 years. In particular, division 8A of the Public Service Act provides for secretaries to departments to remain beyond the age of 65 years, at the discretion of the relevant authority. Division 8B of the Public Service Act allows a similar discretion for senior executive officers of the Public Service to remain in office beyond the age of 65 years. Division 8C provides the same opportunity for other officers of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 33 of the Public Service Act, which relates to the application of the merit principle, provides that there should be no discrimination in the Public Service on the ground of age. Furthermore, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission regulations provide that it is an offence to discriminate on the ground of age, and that such offences may be heard by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On those grounds we do not accept that, because the Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Agency in particular may at some future time be a full time executive chairman, he should thereby be forced to continue the possibility of suffering age discrimination. We believe that age discrimination should be removed in all its forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government raised the argument that in particular circumstances it may not be appropriate for a person to remain in such a position beyond the age of 65 years. If the provisions of the Public Service Act are applied, in those circumstances the person would not stay on, because it is a discretionary decision that can be made for someone to remain beyond the age of 65. We believe that subsection 20(3), which does not allow the appointment of anyone over the age of 65, should be removed so that age discrimination does not continue, and then at least the discretion remains to allow the appointment of someone over that age, should he or she be a fit and proper person and competent to hold that position. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on rice produced in Australia to raise funds for a research and development program for the rice industry. This has been requested by the Ricegrowers' Association of Australia on behalf of New South Wales' rice growers and on behalf of the Queensland Rice Marketing Board, which represents Queensland rice growers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will provide funding to match industry levies up to 0.5% of the annual gross value of production in line with established policy of encouraging increased rural productivity and profitability through research and the commercialisation of research findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's rural research and development policy, which encourages increased contributions by primary industry, was established by the Government in February 1985 and reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement, "Research Innovation and Competitiveness".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Australian rice industry consists of a temperate industry located in NSW, producing about 95 percent of total production and a tropical industry located in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry produces around 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes of paddy rice per year, with a gross value of production in 1989-90 of $148m. About 85-90 percent of production is exported to around 30 countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Domestically, sales (including value adding), exceed $60m. There is significant value adding involved, with the industry packaging and marketing its own branded product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rice industry has a major commitment to research in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic marketing position. Research has, in the past, been funded primarily by growers with Commonwealth grant assistance also provided from the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of a joint Commonwealth/industry scheme will broaden the industry's research funding base and assist in enabling the industry to achieve its full potential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy will apply to those varieties included in the Schedule to the Bill but with provision for new varieties to be added and for varieties no longer produced to be deleted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current industry research funding arrangements, both the NSW and Queensland rice industries fund research on a budget allocation basis. That is, the industry agrees on the total amount of contribution before the start of each financial year and, in fact, before the greater proportion of rice is harvested. This ensures a reliable flow of funds to the research program, whereas a volume based funding system would have reflected the swings in production which have occurred over the last few years. For example production fell from 923,000 tonnes in 1989-90 to a forecast 726,000 in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This arrangement will continue under the new scheme. In practice then, the operative levy rate per tonne will be determined following the decision by industry on the level of its bulk contribution. This rate will be calculated towards the end of the harvest but before the start of the financial year, when production can be accurately determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry may determine different rates for different rice varieties to account for differing research requirements in each season but cannot determine a rate of more than $2 per tonne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the industry has determined a rate or rates, the Minister will be advised and will set those rates and have them published in the Gazette. The levy rate will be set by subordinate legislation because timing is tight between setting the rates of the levies and the first payment of levies. The levy will be collected from pool returns at the end of the season for the research program of the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy will be payable by the grower and its collection will be in accordance with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amounts equal to the levy and the Commonwealth's matching contribution will be paid into a separate sub-account under the management of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. Based on the current level of funding by the industry, in some years its contribution will be greater than 0.5% of the gross value of production, which is the maximum the Commonwealth will match for funding purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that total levy collections will remain constant from one year to the next, or perhaps increase slightly. The cost to the budget, in terms of Commonwealth matching expenditure, is expected to be $570 000 per annum in 1991-92 to 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will come into force on Royal Assent and the levy will be imposed on rice produced and delivered to the processor after that time. It is intended that the levy will be imposed on rice produced in the 1991-92 season and the research program under this arrangement will commence in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Rice Levy Bill 1991 is to impose a levy on rice produced in Australia to support research into the industry. This levy is to be matched by the Commonwealth up to a maximum of the rice industry's gross value of production for the rice industry. This brings the rice industry into line with many other rural industries which have been successful in securing a dollar for dollar industry-government payment arrangement for research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the rice industry extends back to the early 1890s when the earliest commercial rice crops were grown by Chinese market gardeners in the Northern Territory. Rice was grown at Humpty Doo and Pine Creek in order to supply Chinese people working on the gold fields. Currently, production of rice is located mainly in New South Wales, where rice crops have been commercially grown since 1924, and more recently in Queensland, from 1967. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Riverina District of south-western New South Wales approximately 1,800 irrigated farms produce one crop per year and typically harvest around 800,000 tonnes of rice. New South Wales produces all types of rice, including approximately one-third of the total production of long grain rice. The main variety grown is Calrose, a medium grain rice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In comparison, the north Queensland rice industry is centred on Home Hill and Mareeba, with two annual crops and a harvest size of approximately 25,000 tonnes of rice. Blue Bonnet, a long grain rice, is the only variety grown in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1990-91, $585,000 of grower money was spent on research. Of this, $166,500 came from voluntary levies and the balance was taken out of the Ricegrowers Cooperative pool. The Commonwealth matched this voluntary levy and provided a $37,294 grant through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation to take its total contribution to $203,848. The Commonwealth does not match the grower money taken from the pool for research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Government's rural research program, individual industries can obtain dollar for dollar matching funds from the Commonwealth up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of the total gross value of production. This program is to encourage increased rural productivity and profitability through research and commercialisation of research findings. It is also to guarantee a higher level of industry contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ricegrowers Association of Australia has requested this legislation so that it can obtain more Commonwealth funds and broaden its major commitment to research in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic marketing position.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation simply sets a maximum levy of $2 a tonne and the operative level will be set each year by regulation. This is necessary because the industry wants to continue with a firm budgeted amount at the beginning of each year, and it will not be until harvest time that it knows how much rice is likely to be produced and therefore how much levy needs to be applied to achieve its result. The swings in production are so pronounced that the industry believes that this is the only way to ensure a reliable flow of finance to the vital research program. It does mean that in some years the levy may be above 0.5 per cent of annual gross value of the product. In that case anything above 0.5 per cent will not be matched by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to have the levy has been arrived at by the rice growers through the thoroughly democratic means of voicing their own opinions. All the rice growers are members of the cooperative. They have therefore all had the opportunity of voting at annual meetings on this levy. There were also 170 growers present at the annual meeting of the Ricegrowers Association of Australia last month and they voted unanimously to accept the recommendation of the research and development committee to introduce this levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growers realise that they are already paying the money because, while there have been voluntary levies and some funds from government through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the extra funds needed for a research program have come from the pool. The difference is that it will now be out in the open and the Government will match it dollar for dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rice industry is an important industry. It is a world leader in efficient production, and 85 per cent of rice grown in Australia is exported. If fair access to international markets were given to Australian rice, production could expand quite considerably because the Australian industry can compete. However, rice is subject to restrictions in international trade. Japan is well known for its rice importing restrictions, as are Taiwan and Korea. There are also restrictions in other South East Asian countries. There is a general assumption that these countries would be able to produce rice more cheaply than Australia. They cannot. The cost of production of rice in Japan and I believe also in Taiwan is three to four times that in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the importance of the Uruguay Round of GATT. Our focus in these discussions tends to be on Europe and the United States. However, if there is a successful GATT round, many of the restrictions on agricultural imports to South East Asian countries would be reduced and there would be a fairer trade for Australian goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian rice industry is subject to import competition and there are no restrictions on that. It is interesting that some of those imports are from countries which subsidise their export and from countries that do not allow our rice to be exported back to them. Hopefully, the GATT round will sort that out. The coalition supports this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The levy on rice proposed by this Bill will provide funds for research and development for the rice industry. The Bill provides for the Government to match industry levies of up to 0.5 per cent of the annual gross value of production from the Australian rice industry. The industry in the Riverina area of New South Wales and in Queensland produces about 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes a year with a gross value of some $148m in the year 1989-90, most of which came from exported produce. The joint Commonwealth-industry scheme the subject of this Bill will broaden the industry funding base and help in enabling the industry to reach its full potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy rate per tonne will be determined after the industry decision on the level of its bulk contribution, calculated towards the end of the harvest when likely production can be determined. Different rates may be determined for different rice varieties and rice harvested in different seasons, but the rate may not exceed $2 per tonne. The Minister has not yet set the rate and will not do so until the rates for each variety have been recommended by the two State marketing authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The likely cost to the Commonwealth in matching the industry levy would be $570,000, starting in the 1991-92 year. Previously, the Government had contributed only about $203,000. So, over a couple of years, there will be a significant increase in the amount of money available for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand the arrangements, the levy is collected pursuant to regulations under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act and then it will be distributed under the regulations adopted pursuant to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation will have control of allocation of the moneys for research and development grants, and it is my understanding that the Corporation will allocate to the various areas of rice production moneys in accordance with the levies collected from those areas and after consultations with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Tambling has explained the Bill in detail, and I will not repeat what he has said. He has also made some comments on the rice industry in the Riverina area of New South Wales. The Riverina area produces by far the largest amount of rice in Australia and is the part of the industry that most Australians are aware of. But in the few minutes that are available to me in this debate, I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate the small but significant rice producing areas of Queensland in the Burdekin and Mareeba areas of that State. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rice has been grown in Queensland on and off for over 100 years, but the modern rice industry in Queensland commenced in 1968 when a small group of farmers, under the auspices of the Lower Burdekin Development Council, commenced growing long grain rice, which had been developed in the United States. I well remember those days when there were two groups growing rice in the area&mdash;it was a very small and infant industry&mdash;and the two groups were actually competing. Each ended up building its own mill. But since those days things have settled down and there is now one organisation, one operation, in the Burdekin area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual throughput in the last 10 years of the Burdekin industry was about 20,000 tonnes of paddy rice, which in domestic and international terms is very small, considering that the total Australian industry is in the range of 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently there are 17 growers of rice in the Burdekin and 15 in Mareeba, which is up on the Atherton Tableland. The areas under production in the Burdekin are 2,250 hectares, and in Mareeba, 1,000 hectares. Unlike the Riverina crop, in north Queensland there are two crops each year. There is the winter crop, which is the major crop because it has better yields of 6.5 tonnes to 7 tonnes per hectare, which occur because of better weather conditions and less insect infestation at that time. Approximately 20,000 tonnes of paddy rice is produced from that crop. The summer crop has lower yields, and it is also slightly less economic because of the higher watering costs, and because of more difficulty with pests. About 7,000 to 10,000 tonnes of rice are produced in the summer season. The winter crop is planted in July-August, and the harvesting commences very soon, and goes on for a couple of months. The summer crop is planted around this time, and again goes on for a couple of months and is harvested in April and May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rice is milled at the Cooperative's mill at Home Hill, and it operates very efficiently and provides employment for that small rural town. The Cooperative owns all of the assets of the mill and is the sole agent to mill and market rice on behalf of the Queensland Rice Marketing Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 50 per cent of the income earned from the Home Hill mill will be from overseas markets such as in Mauritius, Papua New Guinea, the Pacific islands, and, indeed, the Middle East. New value-added products have been successfully launched overseas by the Cooperative, and numerous new projects are being developed. Establishing new markets is made difficult because of high tariff rates in other countries, and by competition against subsidised rice with which we compete on overseas markets. I particularly mention the Thai rice industry, which is heavily subsidised and against which we compete. Also, in Japan, of course, there is a complete ban, a prohibition against Australian rice going into that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Burdekin area, all but 180 hectares of land producing rice is new land which has been opened up following the completion of the Burdekin dam&mdash;a project which, I am pleased to say, the Fraser Government was instrumental in establishing, and which has meant such a lot to, and is such a major project for, north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the rice industry has considerably assisted the productivity of the land opened up as a result of the Burdekin dam. It has also enabled the land there to be used for more than one crop. Rather than concentrating on sugar for all of the land that is watered by the Burdekin dam, rice has provided an alternative crop. In times when sugar prices fall, as they have in recent times, this means that growers have the alternative of switching to rice, or increasing their involvement in rice production. The rice industry recently invested an additional 8,000 tonnes of storage in its Home Hill plant, and this will now allow an increase in the annual production by about 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international rice market and trade is relatively small, because most rice produced around the world is consumed in the country of origin. Less than 5 per cent of the total world production is exported and traded on the international market. This small market, with relatively few buyers and sellers, and its demand and supply, is relatively unpredictable and variable. Every tonne of increased production from the Burdekin will be exported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increasing recognition that north Queensland is becoming an integral part of the Asia-Pacific region will lead to the production of varieties of rice compatible with those markets. The high cost of freight will preclude our rice being marketed in many areas. However, numerous shipping links currently operating from Townsville will create niche markets for high quality varieties of rice, for which Burdekin and Mareeba are renowned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland rice industry is able to compete head to head against similar imported products. The industry does this in spite of enormous disadvantages that it suffers such as higher freight and labour costs than apply overseas. Of course, that is one of the things which this nation has to address in its future economic plans. As with most other primary industries, the problems which the rice industry experiences from competition from corrupt overseas markets and subsidised competition can only be addressed if Australia is able to deregulate input costs such as labour, government charges and freight and waterfront charges. The industry is not only required to compete with subsidised imports but also to export into markets in competition with subsidised competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland industry, as I mentioned, ships to Papua New Guinea, Mauritius, New Caledonia, New Zealand and other Pacific islands. The industry recently cracked a lucrative export market in Papua New Guinea by introducing a line of flavoured rice which was launched in Port Moresby by the Queensland Premier in August this year. That flavoured rice resulted from some work by the International F<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>ood Institute of Queensland which assisted the industry in finding flavours and spice mixes to add to the rice for sale in Papua New Guinea. It is a very popular product in Papua New Guinea because of that flavour adding. This export market also assists dramatically the increasing trade links between north Queensland and Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the problems being confronted by the industry are: the need to improve grain quality; the need to identify market requirements of particular rice varieties; the need to develop various cropping regimes to ensure long term cropping for rice; the need to identify any influx of pests and diseases which may occur due to the tropical environment in which it is grown in the north Queensland areas; the need to improve technology, especially for by-products, and to improve technology for value adding; and the need to ensure environmental security, because the Burdekin crops in particular are being grown on new lands and it is necessary to quickly identify any agronomic or pest problems that might arise on that new land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these problems will be able to be investigated by the Burdekin industry or by the north Queensland industry with the funds raised as a result of the Rice Levy Act. In the past, growers have voluntarily funded research and development of improvements in their industry but the passing of this Bill will formalise and guarantee those funds and will also lead to a substantial increase in the input from the Commonwealth general revenues towards research and development in the rice industry. The Liberal Party enthusiastically supports this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to go into the Rice Levy Bill in detail because my colleague Senator Tambling has already done so. There are a number of points that need to be made in relation to the rice industry, including the importance of research and development. As everybody in this chamber would know, the rice industry falls into two parts: the New South Wales portion of the industry and the Queensland portion of the industry. The two parts of the industry have somewhat different faces because in New South Wales the emphasis is on volume production and in Queensland the emphasis has been on niche market production and on dealing with specialist areas. But both parts of the industry will benefit from an improved investment in development and research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, those players who are involved in the bulk portion of the industry&mdash;the growers from New South Wales&mdash;will benefit from improved agricultural practices, and growers in Queensland will benefit from improved research into the treatment and processing of rice. This is very important because we have got to look to our export markets, and I do not believe that we have anywhere near tapped the potential for exports of rice. I just want to deal with a couple of areas to show why this is so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling has already said today that it is important that we get access to Japan, Taiwan and Korea, which at the moment impose restrictions on sales of rice to their domestic markets. We only have to look at the number of people in these countries and the amount of rice that they eat to see what a lucrative export market this is. But we should not just think in terms of the rice that is put on the table in a bowl; the rice market is much bigger than that. I want to take a personal example of the way we have to think laterally when it comes to exporting rice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the people in this chamber or the people listening may not be aware of it, the Chinese community around the world has a very significant festival every year, the August Moon Festival. Part of the process of the August Moon Festival is to eat moon-cakes. Moon-cakes are made substantially from processed rice. Just think about the fact that there are 20 million people in Taiwan, every one of whom will eat at least one moon-cake every year, and one can see the enormous market for processing of the rice into forms other than table rice. We are talking of probably about five million pounds of rice being eaten in Taiwan in the form of moon-cakes in just one day of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it is very important that we continue to put money into research and development for the rice industry, not only so that we are and remain the most efficient producers of rice, in terms of the grain itself, but also to ensure that we, as rice producers, are also the most efficient processors of rice. This is the crux, because the rice industry, especially in Queensland, is characterised by a group of people who control the production of the rice from the farm right through to the finished product. So all the improvements in processing efficiency will be passed back directly to the growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a situation where we are talking about the Government and the growers funding research into processing and having the profits of that processing going in whole or in part to other parties. What we are looking at is a very efficient industry, and an industry where the growers have taken control of their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imminent release of coconut flavoured rice in New Zealand, where there is a large South Pacific islander population, is one of the ways that industry members are grasping hold of the potential to sell rice into niche markets and to maximise return, not just to themselves but to Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an increasing prospect for us to sell more exports.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taiwan is facing imminent entry into GATT. We know that Taiwan's market practices, its trade practices, have not been lilywhite in the past and that Australia has been on the receiving end of them. I have said in this chamber on numerous occasions that we have to be more up-front in our relations with Taiwan, and it is still of concern to me that our somewhat unsatisfactory treatment of Taiwan as a trade partner over previous years could discriminate against Australia in this new Taiwanese market. While the Taiwanese will be breaking down the legal barriers to entry to that market, there is no reason to believe that Australian exporters of rice or beef or anything else will get preferential treatment or even equal treatment as compared with our American competitors, because, while this nation and this Government refused to support Taiwan's entry to GATT, the Americans were supporting it with alacrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result will be that Australian producers and exporters may well be discriminated against&mdash;if not legally, at least culturally&mdash;in terms of business relations between the two nations. This is why it is important that Australia look to all other countries where Australia has the potential to sell exports and make sure that everything possible is done to maximise those export sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures taken in this Bill are beneficial to the industry and will be good for promoting future profitability of the industry. But there is a lot more that this Government must do in terms of international relations, especially with countries like Taiwan, and especially in its trade relations with our other neighbours in South East Asia&mdash;such as Malaysia. Even though we are the most efficient producers, the Government must ensure that we are not discriminated against and must ensure that our producers get a fair go on the international market. That is all our producers ask. That is what this Government must do, and that is what we in the National Party call upon the Government to do. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the gains listed by the Australian Wheat Board include a 50 per cent reduction in the cost of grain stevedoring nationally and a reduction of 70 per cent of the work force in grain terminals. Since 1988-89 the time taken to turn around grain vessels at Australian ports has been cut in half. This is the average figure, and the Australian Wheat Board describes the improvements at some ports as being more spectacular. For example, it cites Newcastle, where ship turnaround time has gone from five days to 1.6 days. The overall savings to the industry are estimated currently to be at least $10m annually.</PARA>

If that process is helpful in facilitation, a significant number of projects could well go ahead. I am unable to say what the employment implications of those projects will be, except to say that in the construction phase the employment implications are usually significant; in the longer term, direct employment in these projects is not very high.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is yes. There continues to be a very significant amount of public coverage of the critics of the third runway. This issue has been raised again in today's press. We are told that the EIS fails to make out an economic case for the third runway and a new investigation and a new cost benefit analysis are advocated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all are. The issues they raise have been dealt with very thoroughly indeed by both of these documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EIS itself contains a comprehensive evaluation of the alternatives to the Government's strategy of construction of the third runway and the staged development of Badgerys Creek. The EIS clearly shows that this strategy results in the most cost-effective provision of airport capacity in terms of construction costs per passenger; lower airport construction costs in net present value terms than the Badgerys Creek alternatives; and a reduction of average annual delays at Kingsford-Smith Airport by a total of 127,000 hours, resulting in savings to airline operators and, therefore, their passengers of around $640m per annum. An amount of $320m for the construction of the third runway and associated work will be needed to get this benefit. I stress that again: a construction cost of $320m and annual savings to the industry and, therefore, the flying public of $640m. That is not a bad investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third runway will also result in a lesser number of people being seriously affected by noise compared with the alternatives of a substantial domestic airport at Badgerys Creek. The comparisons are 26,900 with the third runway as compared with 34,800 without it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplement also reviewed the Coopers and Lybrand cost-benefit comparison between the third runway and a substantial domestic airport at Badgerys Creek, prepared as part of the airport coordinating task force submission to the draft EIS. The review found that there was a net benefit of over $1 billion in favour of the third runway, as compared with $17m found by the Coopers and Lybrand study. Moreover, this review included an assessment of loss of social amenity due to aircraft noise and found a noise cost penalty of $98m for the immediate construction of a domestic airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EIS demonstrates that an airport at Badgerys Creek is unlikely to be commercially viable, as I have said before, until 2005 to 2010. Consequently, the immediate development of a regular public transport airport would need to be funded by the Australian taxpayer. In contrast, the third runway has been assessed by the FAC to be a commercially viable proposition on the basis of its own investment criteria and would be totally funded in a normal commercial manner by the FAC.</PARA>

Has the Minister seen the latest unemployment figures, which indicate that the number of discouraged job seekers has risen and that the number of people looking for work has fallen, mainly because of women giving up the search for part time jobs? Has the Minister seen a report earlier this year of a study by researchers at Flinders University where one researcher, Dr Travers, indicated that real wages have declined so that people are working harder for less by virtue of the fact that the spouse has had to get an income to make ends meet?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a lot of presumptions in Senator Crichton-Browne's question which slightly colour any answers that I give. The present position is that the United States Government and the Australian Government have been negotiating over the transition from American to Australian control of the North West Cape. The most recent set of negotiations was completed some time in October. It is expected that in the near future there will be an exchange of letters between Secretary Chaney and me to finalise that agreement. Initially that was to have been signed at the Ausmin talks. Then we had the Bush visit substituted for the Ausmin talks, and Senator Crichton-Browne would realise that at the moment there is no formal process in that sense. It will be by an exchange of letters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding for the North West Cape will come out of the existing defence budget. I cannot give an absolutely accurate total of running costs currently because the US picks up a fair bit of it, and the way it breaks up its programs makes it impossible to put a total running cost on it.

It would be a matter of concern to the locals that, with the Americans moving out and vacating a number of houses&mdash;I am not sure how many, but certainly scores of houses&mdash;this could have a depressing effect on the property market.

The Consul was unaware of the details of the conversation in question. The article was faxed to him by my office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to provide the Government's response to the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in its Report on a proposal to amend the National Capital Plan dated September 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Capital Planning Authority has proposed an amendment to the National Capital Plan to encourage the redevelopment of Canberra City Sections 10, 37 and 62, which includes land presently occupied by the Civic Pool, the YMCA, the Olympic Bowl, the Army Training Centre and the ACT Government Engineering Depot. In particular, the amendment provides for office development on Section 10 and protects Section 37 for recreational and other uses compatible with the Civic Pool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 23 April 1991 I referred the proposal to amend the National Capital Plan to the Committee for consideration. In its Report the Committee supported the proposed amendment and confirmed that it provided a basis for redevelopment within the area in a manner consistent with the heritage and recreational value of this important area of the National Capital. However, the Committee made some recommendations on specific planning matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's four key recommendations have been accepted by the Government and reflected in the final amendment to the National Capital Plan. These recommendations were that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">'Offices' be permitted on that part of Section 10 not presently occupied by the Amdahl Building;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">'Administrative Use' should be removed from the range of uses permitted on Section 37 and that such</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">uses within the study area be confined to Section 10;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Civic Pool and its landscape setting remain the dominant use on Section 37; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Development Condition requiring `a strong built edge to Constitution Avenue' be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 17 other recommendations that have either been accepted, accepted in principle or accepted in part. Only one recommendation has not been accepted at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three recommendations support the decentralisation of Commonwealth office employment. Although these recommendations are not inconsistent with the general intent of the Plan they require further study by the NCPA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two recommendations relating to environmental monitoring in Civic will need to be examined in conjunction with the ACT Administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that a building height of less than six storeys be considered on London Circuit and at the Eastern end of Section 37. Although this is accepted in Section 37 it is considered that buildings of up to six storeys in height should be allowed on the frontage of London Circuit subject to certain standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCPA will address a number of the other recommendations which have been accepted in principle in consultation with the ACT Planning Authority.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Substantially, this report deals with the operations of the Special Investigations Unit, which was set up by the Government and which has been investigating allegations of war crimes by residents in Australia for over four years. At the moment it has a funding guarantee from the Government until June next year, which will take this process through a period of five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is causing some concern, because it is clear that this has become a very extensive and expensive operation indeed. The total expenditure of the special investigations unit up to 30 June 1991 amounted to $11.381m. In the last year it spent some $3.8m, and presumably it will spend that amount again next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though the matters that are referred to the Unit are running down, because it is reported here that in the current year, up to 30 June last, a further 137 suspects were referred to it. As at the end of 30 June 1991 there were reported to be 27 active investigations, which included the case that has now gone to trial&mdash;the one and only case in all these years of investigations that has gone to trial. But there are 15 others, and it is certainly clear that some of them may well yet go to trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total cost of the Special Investigations Unit has been very great indeed. There are still large numbers of matters being referred to it. In addition, as I think we all know, the one and only case which was launched by the prosecution, went to the High Court which upheld the Act passed by the Senate at the end of 1988. The High Court upheld that Act and the prosecution case has now just commenced in Adelaide. Until that time there had been expended in costs by the Crown Prosecutor more than $300,000 and more than $600,000 in legal aid by the public defender acting for the defence. Because it was thought that the case might go to trial, the Director of Public Prosecutions was provided with $9.5m to conduct that case in the last financial year. However, only $300,000 was expended, largely because of the High Court proceedings. It is perfectly clear that the trial of that one case will be enormously expensive and any other trials are likely to be of the same order. These must be added, of course, to the very large costs of the special investigator to which I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the operation of the War Crimes Act, as contained in the report, of which I have given a very brief summary, causes a good deal of concern and alarm as to how long this Unit will continue to operate and how many prosecutions will be launched, if indeed any further prosecutions are launched. This is, of course, apart from the one that is now under way. The experience of the difficulties of bringing the evidence before the courts in Australia will reveal whether it is possible, in these circumstances, to really launch prosecutions. I hope the Government will give very close attention to the question of whether it should continue with this exercise.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is essentially the work of the Special Investigations Unit which was established following the passage of the War Crimes Amendment Act 1988. In turn, this was the consequence of a report of Mr Menzies&mdash;the so-called Menzies report&mdash;relating to the entry of suspected war criminals into Australia. The Director of the Unit is now Mr Blewitt who replaced the first Director, Mr Robert Greenwood, QC, who has since returned to private practice. The report confirms that the political changes sweeping Europe have directly affected the work of the Unit. While initially that work was interrupted on some occasions in Lithuania, Latvia, Yugoslavia and of course during the Gulf war, the investigators are now receiving more cooperation in countries where access to archives is now easier than it was before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note with interest that New Zealand has passed legislation to conduct a war crimes inquiry, and that two units have been established in the United Kingdom: one in England and Wales; and the second in Scotland, with separate jurisdictions. During the last year alone, the Unit has received allegations of some further 137 suspects. The allegations now total 242. An indication that the investigations are being carried out with some care and due diligence is that a large number of these cases are not being proceeded with simply because the basic elements and the information concerning the allegations provided cannot be substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at 30 June 1991, there remained 27 active investigations, including the case currently proceeding in Adelaide, of which 11, as the report says, are not promising and are likely to be suspended. The matter of cost has been raised by Senator Durack as being of concern. Whilst I appreciate that parliament must be accountable for every dollar spent, I believe the money spent in the current year, some $3.8m together with a further $325,000 spent by the Director of Public Prosecutions, is money extremely well spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here not with crimes of a normal kind. We are dealing here with a principle that this country needs to establish&mdash;that war crimes are not crimes that we are in any way prepared to condone. War itself is something that will, hopefully, in due course become a thing of the past and naturally we will exert all efforts to achieve world peace. But if war does break out, if it is considered by those pursuing it that it is inevitable, then it is absolutely essential that it is conducted within civilised limits and that people who take advantage of the chaos or of power that accrues to them in these circumstances will be brought to justice. I believe the Nuremberg principle that was established, of individual responsibility, must be pursued. We are dealing in these matters not with people who are simply cogs in a machine, but people who committed acts on their own initiative and with a degree of persistence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument that is often advanced is the length of time that has elapsed, and certainly we have reason to question why it took us so long to establish this Unit when the initial War Crimes Act was passed in 1945. This is a matter for criticism of successive governments: it is not a reason for not doing anything at the moment.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I have been trying to reach Broken Hill by telephone for the last little while and I note that there is a great deal of congestion.

I do not know whether that means a lot more people are using telephones, but I do know that there is a lot more congestion at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from this annual report that profit is down from $1.28 billion last year to $962m this year. I also note that Telecom Australia is about to shed 6,000 jobs by way of redundancies. I believe Telecom, in taking this step, is attempting to make itself a little more lean and mean. If the jobs are not needed, that is fine. But if it is a cost cutting exercise only, which means that there will be fewer services from Telecom, this will be a problem, especially for people in country areas who rely so much on telephones and on the network providing a good service. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In the five minutes allotted to me, I shall deal with four of the matters mentioned in the report. Although the Australian Fisheries Council meeting was held in Wellington, New Zealand, and was attended by 30 to 40 people, it is no wonder that the fishing industry is in such a mess considering the number of issues that are under discussion and the state of inactivity. The Council appears to float issues along from one meeting to the next and then work out where the next meeting will be held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first important matter is the importation of goldfish. Frankly, I cannot accept the attitude of AQIS that the acceptable level of risk is `reasonable'. There is either a risk or there is not. If there is a risk, the answer is no, they should not be imported. All the report says is, `Insufficient evidence is available to justify a ban on defensible quarantine grounds'. If there is a risk, that is a ground of defensible risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is aquiculture. Apparently, the Australian Fisheries Council is still doing very little. But the report says, `Council NOTED the progress in the development of a National Strategy on Aquaculture'. At this stage, with aquiculture having grown in Australia for as many years as it has, it is pathetic to be still trying to work on the development of a national strategy. Surely, we can find enough people in the various departments at the State and Federal levels to do something about it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter is that of recreational fishing. About a week ago I went to a national conference of recreational fishermen. I can certainly advise the Federal Government and the State governments that the recreational fishermen are years ahead of government when it comes to looking at the issues, assessing them and seeing what the future holds in store. I found them to be very much unanimous in their views and very well organised. I expect them to be moving to assist in the management of the Australian fishing industry and fishing generally to a much higher extent in the next months, I would hope, certainly not years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter is a rather frightening list raised by the Standing Committee of the major issues that still require attention. Notwithstanding all the Commonwealth staff and corresponding State staff around Australia, these items require resolution:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">finalisation of the list of species</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear the remarks of Senator Archer because I agree entirely with what he has said. We have in front of us a document which records a meeting in New Zealand of the Australian Fisheries Council, of which the Minister for Fisheries in New Zealand was merely an observer. If there is an example of waste of financial resources, taking this vast number of people to New Zealand to swan around&mdash;I use the word quite deliberately&mdash;and simply `note' this and `note' that, and that is what the report says all the way through, and a Council which is supposed to be keeping an overview of an industry which is in dire straits with species after species heading towards extinction, certainly heading towards closure of large numbers of fisheries for very long periods of time if those fisheries are to recover at all, then the process we have described in this report is totally inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Australian Fisheries Council is made up of the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the State Ministers. If this report indicates their level of concern, then it goes some way to explain why so little is being done in relation to this very important industry which is in such terrible straits. Just to take one example, Senator Archer mentioned the importation of goldfish, which undoubtedly are capable of carrying, and undoubtedly do carry, diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree entirely with Senator Archer that the risk of the importation of these diseases into this country should be a sufficient reason. There are no good reasons why goldfish need to be imported at all, particularly if they pose a threat to such an important indigenous industry. Picking up what the report says about the orange roughy stock on the Challenger Plateau:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Council NOTED&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is typical of what goes right through this report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the outcome of recent consultations on the management of orange roughy stock which straddles the waters of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone and adjacent high seas areas on the Challenger Plateau.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Zealand ACKNOWLEDGED the contribution made by Australia and NOTED that it was also important to control the effort of other nations in the area.</PARA>
<PARA>A species which in the four or five years since it has been exploited has been pushed rapidly virtually to extinction in every area where that exploitation has gone on, yet here we have the Federal and State Ministers responsible simply noting the outcome of consultations and acknowledging a contribution made by Australia. This is a fishery which Australia moved into with totally inadequate knowledge of the life cycle of these fish and the great age&mdash;roughly 37 years&mdash;that they have to achieve before they get to sexual maturity. Australia moved in and grossly exploited them, yet the Australian Fisheries Council can merely `note' this and `note' that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it goes on with the other items. The southern bluefin tuna is another fishery stock which is certainly under excessive pressure and inadequately managed, and again we have the statement that Council simply `noted' a common desire to manage these. What we want in these reports is some more positive indication of how that management will be carried out. Presumably, this Council can make some decisions which would come back and be reflected in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to driftnet fishing, the Council noted the imminent introduction of the package of legislation that we dealt with a few weeks ago in this place. It noted that New Zealand had ratified the international convention on driftnet fishing. It did not even bother to note that New Zealand had authorised a much more stringent driftnet fishing code than that in the international agreement. Clearly, that was an important lesson for Australia to pick up and, indeed, has been picked up in the legislation which we passed a few weeks ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to speak in this discussion but, having heard comments made by my colleague Senator Archer and by Senator Coulter, I thought I should. I agree wholeheartedly with their comments about goldfish importation to my State of Tasmania. We have a very valuable, although very young, aquaculture industry. I am concerned about anything that could endanger that industry because it means a lot to Tasmania. We have not too much going for us down there industry-wise at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments have been made by AQIS about that and another matter that concerns me, namely, the importation of uncooked salmon to Australia possibly being allowed. This has the possibility of bringing in whirling disease, which would devastate our fledgling salmon industry. These concerns are shared not only by me, Senator Archer and Senator Coulter but also by people in the industry in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I want to say a few words on this report is that, following a question I asked Senator Button today, it seems to me ridiculous that the Government in its wisdom has spent $16m on building a research vessel for the CSIRO so that it can investigate such things as the orange roughy fishery and other potential fisheries around Australia&mdash;not just around Tasmania&mdash;yet because of the lack of funding that vessel will be laid up in Hobart for the next year. This is happening for the sake of a million or so dollars. It is not just the money that counts but the timing. We will waste a year's valuable research time, which could be spent very profitably in investigating other areas of potential fishing grounds in Tasmania and other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Archer's friends from the north-west coast, the Rockliffs, found the original orange roughy fishery in that area. It has been a question of hit or miss and, as Senator Coulter said, no-one really knows that much about orange roughy. All that is known is that for some reason or other they come together when they are 50 years old, which is when they are caught. Unless we can research these fisheries, how can we keep our fishery industry going&mdash;an industry that is so important to all of Australia but particularly to Tasmania? I find it quite incredible that we have a modern up-to-date fishing research vessel just sitting tied up in the dock in Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in the Soviet Union last year, Duncan Kerr, the honourable member for Denison, and I had quite lengthy discussions with representatives from fishing cooperatives in the Vladivostok and Nakhodka areas. It seems that some of the Russian fishing vessels may be coming to Tasmania from the Nakhodka Cooperative. We also had discussions with Professor Ernst Nosov, who spent 15 years not only with Russian research vessels but also working with the New Zealand Government. He has a great deal of knowledge of fishery areas around the continental shelf of Tasmania. I have been trying for the past year to arrange for him to visit Australia. I think he is coming on 14 November, but the communication difficulties with the Soviet Union have to be tried to be understood. It is incredibly difficult, and indeed almost impossible, to try to get phone calls and faxes through to Vladivostok. I hope that next week I will be able to take Professor Nosov and two colleagues to the CSIRO establishment in Hobart, where they are most keen to talk to him about the research he has done. The fishing industry is crying out for research and knowledge of our fish resource. When we know what the resource is, the Government will be able to take the appropriate steps to ensure that it is protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Harradine, I received these documents only a little while ago and it would be difficult to respond to the content of the documents in some detail. I am aware of the intense interest that Senator Bourne of the Australian Democrats has in this area. I am</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>sure that she will address the detailed content of these reports when that opportunity arises in the program of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I wish to take the opportunity to set down the framework of the concerns of the Australian Democrats in the area of overseas aid. I think it is important for us to be aware of the dimensions of the worldwide crisis. More than a billion people&mdash;one in every five&mdash;still live at this stage in absolute poverty. They struggle to live on less than about $500 a year, and most live in Asia and Africa. One in six people in developing countries still go hungry every day and one in three children under five suffer from serious malnutrition. The 40,000 children who die every day from preventable causes could be saved if the world gave the matter some priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the West alone spent a billion United States dollars in two days on the Gulf war, the same amount spent over a year would have saved children dying from three diseases&mdash;measles, tetanus and polio. Some 50,000 children died from these diseases in the first week of the war. Poverty is the silent killer, attracting no media attention but inflicting as much grief and human suffering as more headline-grabbing tragedies. For this reason, the Australian Democrats' alternative Budget proposes an increase of some $340m for overseas aid, together with an additional $65m for the saving of rainforests the world over, because clearly care for the environment is part of the objectives of overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful to compare the situation between the rich countries and the developing countries in terms of the benefits in trade that we, as a country, receive. While we give just over $1 billion in aid, we receive some $13 billion in return from trade with developing countries. They contribute around $13 billion a year to our well-being. What is more, since some 85 per cent of the aid is actually spent on Australian supplies and consultants, our `generosity' is certainly open to question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to pay some attention to the level of overseas aid that Australia supplies. Since the Hawke Government came to power in 1983 Australian aid to developing countries has been cut. Aid has fallen from 0.51 per cent of gross national product to 0.33 per cent of GNP. Australia's aid is the same dollar value, allowing for inflation, as it was 20 years ago. Yet our per capita income is now at least 20 per cent higher. We have not become poorer as a nation, just a lot meaner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990-91, as I have said, the level remained at 0.33 per cent of GNP. But there were also real cuts of about $100m and, because payments to the international banks were large, other parts of the program have suffered. There has been a cut of about 7 per cent across most areas. It is instructive to look at some of these cuts. South Asia received a cut of 33 per cent which affected projects in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan. In sub-Saharan Africa there have been cuts of 61 per cent. A major food project for workland rehabilitation and reafforestation has had to end. There have been cuts of 24 per cent in Ethiopia and cuts of 8 per cent to non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations program for women and children has suffered cuts over four years of 25 per cent. There have been cuts of 16 per cent to information and development education and cuts of 20 per cent to agricultural research centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a proud record for Australia. Australia should be addressing the following priorities in respect of developing countries: primary education and adult literacy programs; primary health care, including family planning, water and sanitation; agriculture, especially food crops; primary environmental care; community development; and income generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many arguments why Australia should reverse the current trend and increase its aid. The first, and perhaps the most obvious, is the moral argument&mdash;the gap between the rich and the poor. The second is the international comparison argument. Norway contributes 1.02 per cent of GNP; Denmark one per cent; Sweden 1.98 per cent; France 0.79 per cent; Germany 0.41 per cent; and Italy 0.39 per cent. We are just about at the bottom of the ladder with 0.33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the community support argument. Australians are generous people. Some two million people every year give to overseas aid programs which are run by non-government organisations. I believe that the Government should take some note of the will of the Australian people to assist those all over the world who have less. There is the mutual benefit argument, which I adverted to before, that if developing countries are receiving aid to enable them to run a stronger economy they in turn will be trading with Australia. There is the environmental development argument, which I have also mentioned before, that only countries which can satisfy the material needs of their people can set aside resources to save the environment and to ensure that their ecology is put on a sustainable level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with a plea to the Government that these arguments should be taken into account and that the Australian Government should reconsider the level of foreign aid it sets aside for developing countries the world over. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

He was critical of his own Government's reaction to Tiananmen Square. It may have been useful if we had had more journalists, or even a journalist, in attendance from the very beginning.

To 1987 there had been a steady growth in the participation in TAFE. However, in 1988 participation in TAFE began to fall and has continued to fall every year since then. The report indicates that this decline is the result of recurrent funding restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document refers to the Deveson committee report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Training Costs of Award Restructuring</EMPHASIS>. I remind the Senate that the report concludes that the Government's attitudes to resourcing TAFE are anomalous and unsatisfactory. The Deveson committee was concerned that the TAFE system lacked the capacity to meet not only the demands that are currently facing it but also training demands required as a result of award restructuring. Governments have recognised and accepted the need for funding of schools beyond post-compulsory secondary years and they have also accepted the need for additional funds for tertiary places in universities and how TAFE has not been so favoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own State of New South Wales, it has been estimated that next year TAFE may turn away up to 90,000 students because of budgetary constraints. The managing director of TAFE in New South Wales, Dr Gregor Ramsey, is concerned about the imbalance of resources available to universities and TAFE. For instance, he says that universities are training too many teachers and that we cannot employ all the teachers that we produce. On the other hand, TAFE cannot train technicians that are needed for trade courses. He says the problem is that training teachers is controlled by the Federal Government but training plumbers and electronics technicians in the States is under the control of the State governments, which have a lack of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document recognises the problem and urges the Government to implement as a matter of urgency the recommendations of the Deveson committee for real term increases in TAFE recurrent funding of 5 per cent per annum. It also urges governments to redress the unequal treatment received by TAFE compared to schools and universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document is particularly critical of the Government that has paid so little attention to funding issues raised by the Deveson committee report. It is sadly just another example of how this Government believes that it only has to set up committees to solve the nation's problems and does not have to take any notice of the findings and recommendations. This document also calls for governments to set targets for improving TAFE participation, since this has been done for school retention rates and higher education places. It also urges the Government to set targets for young people to achieve recognised skills as they enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Government to carefully consider this report and the Deveson report and not to ignore the findings and recommendations. It must be ensured that TAFE's future and its role as the principal provider of post secondary training of adults is increased rather than diminished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the conclusion of the allotted time for debate on this matter on 17 October I was at the point of congratulating Senator Boswell for making moves to make it a little easier for our rural sector&mdash;our producers&mdash;to challenge whether produce was being dumped in Australia. Senator Boswell's efforts in that regard have been well publicised and I certainly wish him success in continuing to fight that fight on behalf of our rural producers. It is a pity that more assistance is not being given to him through models or examples which our Government could adopt. It seems so much easier for other countries to keep out items of trade which are suspected of being dumped on their domestic markets. The fact is that it seems easier for everybody else in the world to assist their rural producers than it is for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was heading towards the conclusion of my remarks at the time that debate was interrupted. I had already pointed out that the Democrats agree with the general direction of Senator Panizza's motion, which contends that the Government has failed to provide direction for the rural sector. We would certainly agree with that. As a matter of fact, I would like to repeat my analogy, because it has not been challenged. My analogy showed that the control that is being exercised over our economy and over guidance in the rural sector is very much one of deregulation, hands off and non-intervention. The analogy that I drew at that time was that it was very much like a boy on a bike, riding downhill with his hands off and calling out, `Look, Mum, no hands'. It seems to me to be a most appropriate analogy for what is happening with our economy and the Government's degree of intervention on behalf of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that much of this philosophy has been endorsed by the coalition. It is ironic that we see here today this particular motion by Senator Panizza from a group which has supported the deregulationist, economic rationalist model. The irony is one which, if it was not so serious with regard to the rural sector, I would like to spend some time exploring, but I will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that another philosophy associated with that is the one which we are constantly told Australia and the rest of the world should head towards. It is the one of the free trade concept which is, essentially, nonsense. That is why the Democrats will be moving an amendment to this motion. If it is supported, we will be able to support Senator Panizza's motion. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subparagraph (b)(ii), omit "to liberalise international trade".</PARA>
<PARA>We move that amendment because, in essence, those words describe free trade, which we believe is a nonsense, because all trade throughout the world at the moment is distorted by the very fact that governments exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We contend that the very fact that governments exist and that they collect taxes and provide infrastructure does distort trade. Governments provide not only infrastructure in the form of physical infrastructure, but also community defence, law and order, education, public health, support for the arts, recreation and communication systems. We know what governments do, but every act they engage in is an act of support for the activities within their countries. It is the vehicle by which trade and productivity occurs within those countries and some countries place different priorities on different sections of it. Therefore, some industries or activities within nations receive greater support than they do in other countries. That is the distortion of trade. That is why the concept of free trade is a nonsense in our present world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, if a government abandons all of its responsibilities in these areas, it is no longer a government. Only then can it be truthfully claimed that we have free trade&mdash;total laissez faire, the hands off the bike completely. That would be the only situation where there would be no support for production, whether it be primary, secondary or tertiary production. Only then could we truthfully argue that there are no government subsidies for production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously we are not in that position; obviously we cannot get to that position. It is a fallacy to suggest that free trade is the panacea for all our marketing ills. It is an even greater fallacy to suggest that Australia should lead the world by abandoning any support, subsidy or assistance that government can give, especially to those of our rural industries. Those industries are suffering greatest at the hands of this silly notion that we should lead the world&mdash;lead with our chin&mdash;by telling the world that we will abandon all government subsidies and support and that we want the rest of the world to follow our example. What nonsense. How ridiculous. It cannot work that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may be able to convince those nations which are overly subsidising some sectors to the economic disadvantage of the other sectors of their own economies&mdash;we may be able to convince them of the silliness of that&mdash;but we cannot convince them by abandoning our subsidies first and letting our producers suffer in the way that we are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example which is quite easily digestible, even by the coalition at the moment, is that provided by Australia's wool industry. On this very day we are at a point on the roller-coaster ride of wool prices that has been delivered to us with great uncertainty and a total lack of predictability. Anybody who can predict what the average indicative price, or any other price, for wool will be at our next wool sale, will be much cleverer than any of the other predictors who have preceded us over the last few months. They have all failed. Nobody has been able to predict what our prices have been. That is simply because we are in a situation where we could be subjected to manipulation by overseas speculators on our markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is claimed that our wool market is of such a size that it is beyond speculation or manipulation. I would suggest that that is very far from the truth and that the situation it is in at the moment means that it is subjected to speculation, innuendo, gossip, rumour, fashion and a number of other things, over which Australia has no control whatsoever. One of the paths to resolution of that problem would be the reintroduction of our wool futures arrangement, whereby producers could at least hedge to some extent against market fluctuations. Obviously, that would not provide a total answer. I suggest that those proponents of a totally free marketing system would do well to observe the wool prices of the past few months, which have been the cause of extreme financial hardship to those people who have tried to predict and to judge the most appropriate time to put their wool onto our markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before entering the market certain assumptions can be made, but when there is a variation in wool prices of 20c or 30c per kilogram, with tens of thousands of kilograms of wool, any assumptions made on the strength of a price that varies to that extent means a huge difference between predicted and actual returns to the producer. So much for the idea of liberalising trade. That is the justification for the Democrats' amendment. With the words removed as sought, we would be prepared to support the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the irony of this motion being moved by the coalition, and I also see a great deal of irony in what has transpired between the time when the motion was first moved and the debate that is occurring today. It was some months ago that an opportunity first presented itself for the coalition itself to provide some support and direction to Australia's rural community. The first opportunity was when the Democrats moved for the removal of the assets test from the Austudy scheme. To say that I was disappointed is the polite way to describe my reactions. I will stay with that description, but I must say that my reactions were stronger than that. A couple of days ago in one of our daily newspapers we saw the headline `Libs offer to ease Austudy assets test'. The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition spokesman on education, Dr David Kemp. . . said a coalition government would temporarily suspend the assets test for families in `extreme economic hardship'.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in regard to Austudy. What disgusted me about this is that that opportunity was presented to the coalition several months ago, when all it had to do was to support the Democrats notice of motion to disallow the regulation which imposed an assets test on the Austudy scheme. That opportunity sailed past the coalition and was not taken advantage of, and now we have the proposition that at some stage in the future a coalition government would support that very notion. I find this hypocritical to say the least, and certainly it is misleading to our rural community. Notwithstanding the irony in this motion, I think the best thing we can do is to support it, if our amendment is successful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Senator Panizza's motion on the Government's failure to provide direction and support to Australia's depressed rural sector. The Government has paid too little attention to the difficulties being experienced in our rural and regional areas. There is no denying that, isolated as we are in Canberra, we fail to pay more than lip service to the real tragedy in the rural areas. I do not know how many honourable senators had the opportunity a few weeks ago to meet with members from the Isolated Children's and Parents' Association. They are the face of rural Australia. It is those people and others just like them that this Federal Government has ignored and has failed. I have often spoken both inside and outside this place in recent weeks on the rural crisis and on the twin evils of commodity collapse and drought and the Federal Government's inertia. In fact, I believe it is just outright scornful neglect for the rural sector of Australia. Let me establish the extent of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm incomes this year will drop to an historic new low. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics predicts that farm incomes will fall 24 per cent this year, and this follows the 34 per cent slide last financial year. For wool and summer crops, the outlook is absolutely bleak. Wool prices fell to their lowest level this century just recently and then rose again. Last month the ABARE predicted a 34 per cent drop, but it may well have to revise downwards some of its predictions. It is predicted that income from rice will drop 22 per cent and that sugar income will drop some 13 per cent. These are the lowest recorded farm incomes in real terms ever, and go beyond the figures for the period of drought in 1982-83, which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) claims was the time of our worst recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABARE annual farm survey is specific in its depressing outlook in its report. It has suggested, for example, that 50 per cent of sheep properties will have negative incomes and that another 25 per cent will have incomes below $13,000. Twenty-five per cent of beef properties, supposedly in comparative terms doing well, will have negative incomes, and another 25 per cent will have incomes below $10,900. In fact, across every sort of farming activity the ABARE predicts negative incomes for 25 per cent of all farms. Yet the Prime Minister suggests that this recession is not as bad as people believe, and in any case we are pulling out of it. Obviously, he must be pulling out of a different place from where the farmers are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data from one of his own Government departments clearly suggests that at least for the duration of this financial year a quarter of our farm sector will have negative incomes. This is a sector which traditionally has provided the bulk of our export income. I am pleased that at least the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has now acknowledged the seriousness of the problem and has admitted that Australia is facing its worst recession for 60-odd years. Despite all that, and despite the fact that in New South Wales and Queensland thousands of properties have been drought declared, with no feed, no crops and no prospect of anything growing for at least the next five months, even if it rains, the Federal Government is still just reviewing the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it was some 18 months ago that the Government's drought task force made its first report, yet today we are still waiting for a national drought strategy, although we have now been told by the Minister that at the end of February we will indeed have a national drought strategy. The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, on which Senator Crane, Senator Calvert and I represent this side of the chamber, and of which Senator Bell is also a member&mdash;and I note that Senator Bell is in the chamber at the moment&mdash;is looking at drought strategies and the drought problems and will report by the first sitting day in February. Hopefully, that will help the Federal Minister and the State Ministers at the Australian Agricultural Council meeting, which is to be held at the end of February, to formulate a proper drought policy and strategy for the future. At the moment, farmers do not quite know how they are placed in relation to drought assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is rather unkind to the people in the community who are fighting so hard against the elements at this time. Just this afternoon I was told that the problem with the blue algae moving down the river at Tilpa is adding another dimension to the drought, because even though water is there, it will not be any good for drinking by livestock or humans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government suggested that the new part D, that was added to the rural adjustment scheme so that farmers would be able to receive the equivalent of unemployment benefits, would be of great help. The strategy committee suggested this, but even when that comes out, farmers will still be unable to receive unemployment benefits because they cannot meet the work test requirements. I mentioned that in this place recently. They cannot meet the work test requirements if they are back on the farm still trying to keep it viable. So, right across Australia there are farmers who have no money on which to live. Last week five very concerned people from an area regarded as one of the best and most prosperous farming districts in this country came into my electorate office in Tamworth with requests for assistance. I would hate to imagine what is happening in electorate offices in Dubbo and Broken Hill. The only activity in some of the western areas is wool growing. What is happening to these people and what help can they get? Obviously people in those areas are faced with worry and despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent newspaper reports suggest that up to 20,000 farmers will leave their properties in the next 12 months. I am told that in the area of north-west New South Wales, from the top north-west corner of the central tablelands to the far north-west, there will be 25 to 30 per cent of farmers walking off their farms. What will they walk off with? They will walk off with their furniture or what they can load onto their cars or trucks. They will receive nothing for the sale of their land because interest rates have wiped out any equity they might have had. I do not believe that farmers look for handouts or charity. They just want an understanding by people in this Parliament of what is happening out there. They want to be able to do what they do best: grow wool, crops and beef. But they must be given a fair go and allowed to get on with the job of doing it. It is good to see the Minister for Industrial Relations sitting in the chamber because he used to deal with primary industries matters in this chamber. </PARA>

It is of great concern to us on this side of the chamber. I am sorry I did not know that he was representing primary industries in this chamber; perhaps that shows that at the moment there is not enough effort and drive from the Minister's side of the chamber. If we do not keep the breeding herd and the sheep flock intact so that they will be there in some small measure after the drought has finished, obviously we will not be able to get out of the drought in the best way we could. I know that in the 1982-83 drought we had a very generous package from the Fraser-Anthony Government, of which Senator Durack, who is in the chamber at the moment, was a part. This made sure that breeding flocks and herds were retained so that when the drought broke the farming communities actually bounced back to produce the export income that was so necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

As the shadow Minister for industry and commerce suggested in the other place, it is time to get the lead out of the saddlebags. He was of course referring to the parlous state of our economy with its previous high inflation, which now has been dramatically reduced. I think that is great, but now we face some other problems: dismal productivity and centralised wage fixing which has knocked us for six. All of this has resulted in an economy which has to pay $16 billion a year or 20 per cent of its own export income to service its foreign debt. It has produced an economy with $29 billion of non-performing bank debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government may and in fact does blame external factors for commodity price downturn and unfair protectionist trading policies of other countries. But it cannot apportion blame anywhere other than in its own inappropriate and misplaced interest rate policies for the disastrous damage it has caused to rural Australia. It is all right to say that interest rates are coming down very well now and therefore everything is good, that we have had the right policies in place to bring interest rates down. The problem is&mdash;and I have said this to people in this place over the past three years&mdash;that the high interest rates have now impacted on our input costs in running our farms, our properties and our businesses. I know that Senator Crane will talk about small businesses and businesses in country areas and the problems that they face. Those high interest rates have impacted and they are still causing us problems, even though the interest rate has come down just at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though Senator Collins tells us that he is making progress on the waterfront, this Government cannot make excuses for its archaic waterfront practices, the grossly inefficient transport systems or for our iniquitous tax regime&mdash;a tax regime which does not give any big reward for big effort. This is one of the problems that this Government has inflicted on this country. With the goods and services tax we will give people hope and an opportunity for those who work hard to achieve something in the future. That is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these other things were the work of the Federal Labor Government. What is needed is massive reform and it just is not happening. If the Minister thinks that industrial relations are great in this country, why has he not done something about getting the productivity back to what it should be? On the news today I heard that in the northern part of New South Wales&mdash;and I hope the Minister gives some support to this&mdash;the shire engineers had put a motion to their central body that they all work an extra hour per day to help pull us out of the recession. If everyone took the same approach and worked a 40-hour week instead of a 35-hour week to try to get us out of the recession, it would be a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems at the moment is the tax regime to which the Minister is a party. This means shearers stop shearing at lunchtime because there is no incentive to keep going. Having given their sweat and blood, they find that every sheep they shear after lunchtime on a Friday goes back to the Government to spend in the way it wants, rather than letting them have the money in their pockets to spend the way they want. That is what the Government will find with the GST&mdash;people will have more money in their pocket at the end of the week and more chance of spending it however they want. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister is going to adopt that attitude, why does he not adopt the same attitude with regard to the pea growers in Western Australia, for example? That is totally different. I am very disappointed now&mdash;I said I was delighted&mdash;that the Minister is leaving, because there are some other things he should hear about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has tried to apply a select position in regard to New Zealand and what has occurred with that country in recent years. The Minister claims that these people are breaking the law, when I would claim that they are doing nothing different from what hundreds and hundreds of shearers and people working in the shearing sheds in this country are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the basic thrust of the motion, I will take up where Senator West left off. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hasten to add that we have not heard addressed tonight any of the problems caused by the States. I need to look only at my home State and at how the policies of the Liberal Government there are impacting upon the people.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. She also referred to the Opposition not providing any ideas or thoughts or processes by which the position in rural and regional Australia could be improved. I hasten to add that many of the small businesses, as well as pastoral houses and their employees, in the metropolitan areas are also greatly affected by this recession or depression that we now have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly mention the grain handling charges that are levied by the New South Wales Liberal Government. My understanding is that they are levied by the Grain Elevators Board in New South Wales. If this is the case, it is up to the people involved to make sure that the Grain Elevators Board addresses the inefficiencies. It will never be able to address those inefficiencies unless the industrial system in this country is properly reformed, and I will deal with that matter in a moment or two. I emphasise that the industrial relations system must be properly reformed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about State governments and what they do, let us turn to my own State Government, the Lawrence Government, which recently placed another $45 on third party insurance for all vehicles in Western Australia. That particular charge has an enormous impact on rural Australia. The impact extends far beyond people who live in the cities or who are employed in a particular position. It is applied not only to the family car but also to the trucks, utilities, and other vehicles required to run business operations, and also to tractors, if one happens to have two properties that are separate. In many instances the owners of those properties have to pay eight lots of $45 because of the indiscretions of the current Government in Western Australia with regard to WA Inc., the SGIC and its misplaced investments. Of course, there are many winners out of that, but not the people Senator Panizza is addressing in his motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the position of the Federal Government and some things that can be done. Earlier today we debated the report of Estimates Committee F on the Rural Adjustment Authority. We have recently seen some changes there. Those funds come from the pockets of the taxpayers. There is one thing in the financial arena that this Government could do tomorrow which would have a very beneficial impact on many of those business operations, whether they be farmers, small businesses or regional businesses, and that is to free up the credit lines available to the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday interest rates were again lowered. We can get commercial bills at about 9 per cent, with about a 2 per cent margin on top of that&mdash;about 11 per cent. Yet the Commonwealth Development Bank, because it does not have access to commercial bill lines, swap line facilities and financial facilities that other banks have, still has to charge between 16 per cent and 18 per cent to stay in the marketplace. That is one area where action could be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important in my State of Western Australia because in excess of 35 per cent of total borrowings are held with the Commonwealth Development Bank. When those borrowings were taken out, the position was very different from today. At that time the long term facilities it was going into were significantly cheaper than the short term market for 30-day bills, 90-day bills or 180-day bills, which can be locked in. This is one area where the Federal Government could give flexibility to the financial system, which would take significant pressure off the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to another point in the motion&mdash;a competitive tax structure. We have made it quite clear that we will reform in toto the taxation system. That will involve a substantial lowering of income tax rates, it will involve getting rid of the wholesale sales tax, and it will involve the introduction of a goods and services tax. One aspect of a competitive tax structure is the cost of the current wholesale sales tax regime to the trucking industry. The trucking industry is a crucial part of the infrastructure of rural and regional Australia. Under the current tax regime, on a rig worth $250,000 in the first year the owner of that rig, with the various taxes on it, including the wholesale sales tax, will pay some $80,000 in tax for the privilege of owning and operating it. That does not include income tax if the owner happens to make a profit. In the current situation it is very difficult for such an owner to make a profit. Under our proposals, because these items are business input cost items, such an owner will not have to pay that tax as it will be a credit back to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That on its own will make a significant contribution to the cost infrastructure of transport. It will have benefits not only for rural and regional Australia, to which this motion relates, but for all Australians. There is little that we do in our lives which in terms of business costs does not contain some component that is not transported from one place to another during the life of its operation. In Australia there is little or nothing that does not involve some component of transport&mdash;a transport component which currently is very heavily taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area where action could be taken to ease the pressure of costs is that of fuel excise. During the regime of this Government we have seen fuel excise move from a figure of slightly more than 6c a litre to a figure of 25c a litre today. I appreciate that diesel fuel used on farm is fully rebated but that is just one component of the fuel cost to the rural sector. The trucking industry carries this load, and only about one third of that tax is returned to the roads. It also has an on-farm impact in terms of petrol. The duty is not rebatable on petrol and many vehicles used on farm are petrol driven, particularly in the stock industries and the depressed wool industry at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What always staggers me is the fact that the rail system pays a fuel excise towards the building of roads. I have highlighted a couple of areas in which significant differences could be brought about to the cost inputs paid by the rural sector and others at present. It is worth noting that the fuel costs of our subsidised, highly assisted competitors in the United States are half the Australian costs. In view of the current availability of fuel in this country, particularly oils used in the production of diesel and petrol, it is not necessary that our fuel prices should be so high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that the Minister for Industrial Relations is not present because I now wish to deal with industrial relations reform. In doing so I wish to correct a number of misrepresentations that have occurred in this place in Question Time in recent days. I wish to mention what Senator Cook said in answer to a question on Tuesday of this week. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are talking about a removal of the award system. They are talking about a removal of the Industrial Relations Commission. They are talking about a removal of trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite nonsensical and totally misrepresents our industrial relations policy. Reform of the industrial relations system is absolutely essential if we are to lift productivity. I welcome&mdash;as does John Howard but he was once again misrepresented by the Minister&mdash;what the Commission did last week, but it is only one small step in reforming our industrial relations system. Under current law it can go no further. That decision prevents employers and employees making their own arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it quite clear&mdash;and this has been spelt out many times and it is not necessary for the Minister to misrepresent the position&mdash;that under our policy people will have the option of staying in the current system or of making their own arrangements. The difference between our position and the Government's is that we will give people freedom of choice to enter into the sort of arrangement that suits them. Employers and employees will be able to negotiate their own workplace voluntary agreements. They will not have to be subject to big brother in the form of the unions, employer organisations and the Commission all looking over their shoulder. As I have said, they will have the option of staying in the current system or of moving out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be introducing into industrial relations policy the right of voluntary unionism. That is quite different from claiming that we will remove trade unions. It is not correct to say that we are talking about removing the Industrial Relations Commission when we are giving people the option of staying in the current system or of moving out. Therefore, it is impossible to remove the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform in the industrial relations area will lower costs, increase productivity and benefit the depressed rural sector, and indeed all other sectors. More than that, it will give employees the opportunity to be rewarded for improved productivity; it will give them the incentive to go out and work. It will also give employers and businesses the incentive to expand and to provide job opportunities. Surely everybody in this chamber will recognise the importance of this at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion&mdash;and one could talk about this issue for hours on end&mdash;I wish to say that we will be accepting the Australian Democrats' amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summing up on this motion of condemnation, I would first like to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this debate. Before I go on to deal with the finer points, I would like to put straight a few things that were said by people on the other side of the chamber or by interjection. The first relates to the speech made by Senator West on 17 October when she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the only serious policy proposal we have heard tonight has been for troops on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Troops on the waterfront! Who said that?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; she must have been. I will reiterate what I did say. In making the point that the waterfront was not efficient enough and was not reducing the cost of handling rural products, I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are still 600 or 700 people on the waterfront who are not producing, and something must be done.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook interjected:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would you put the troops in?</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I would not put in troops just for this situation; we do not need troops there at present.</PARA>
<PARA>I will leave that matter there. I think Senator West should reread those remarks. However, I thank her for entering into the debate. She was the only one from the other side who had the gumption to do so. Perhaps she will make a good shadow Minister for primary industry when the John Hewson government is elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to put straight an interjection this afternoon by Senator Cook about New Zealand shearers. We agree that we are here to help primary industries. How better can we help than by getting costs down? Senator Cook said that New Zealand shearers were undercutting Australian shearers. For Senator Cook's information&mdash;I doubt whether he has had much to do with a shearing shed or shearers&mdash;New Zealand shearers are not undercutting Australian award rates. They are shearing for Australian award rates, which is taking the pressure off the Australian farmers to pay overaward rates to shearers. That is exactly what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If any undercutting is done, it is the undercutting of overaward payments. We cannot call that undercutting; it is enterprise bargaining, but enterprise bargaining at award rates. That is what the New Zealand shearers are doing. I for one welcome the New Zealand shearers in Australia not only because they have kept the costs in line with award rates but also because, if it were not for them, we would probably not have enough shearers to produce the Australian clip. Obviously, few younger Australian shearers are prepared to come forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian situation is getting worse by the day. In fact, it has got worse since we debated this matter last week. As late as today the grain industry commented on this issue. Statements have been made that the Australian grain industry is experiencing one of its worst seasons ever. Only Western Australia and South Australia will record production of any note, while yields in Victoria will be satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics forecasts wheat yields for the current crop at 1.24 tonnes a hectare, which is about 25 per cent less than last year and 20 per cent below the average for the past five years. ABARE says that this is the lowest yield since 1982-83. Incidentally, this Government cannot blame Malcolm Fraser for that, as it blamed him for everything that happened in the recession of 1982-83, which was caused by the drought. Total winter cereal production&mdash;wheat, barley, oats and triticale&mdash;in 1991-92 is forecast at 15 million tonnes, 28 per cent less than last year. And so it goes on. I believe that the situation is getting worse by the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Government doing? It is doing nothing but fiddling at the edges. Mr Crean was in Western Australia a couple of weeks ago to talk to the farmers. All he could do was announce a few small peripheral measures in the social security area. Farmers can now get the dole, and I suppose that is a welcome move, although my colleague Senator Brownhill pointed out that there are still some problems with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since he has been Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean has continually told us that the way to go is to value add. I agree totally with him. But what happens when we start even to talk about value adding? I have some information with me about value adding because I was hoping to ask a question today. However, as I have already asked two questions this week, I knew that I would be scratching to get another. In Western Australia the Moora pulp mill is being set up to use straw that has been left behind in the paddocks. The Western Australian branch of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union&mdash;which has nothing to do with the Moora pulp mill because the mill is not even working yet&mdash;has members who currently work for two opposition pulp mills in Western Australia. The union has set about destroying the mill, which it was hoped would come on stream in the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every honourable senator should have received a letter from this union. The union went to the bother of getting a professor&mdash;I cannot remember his name exactly&mdash;to undertake a study simply to destroy that mill. The biggest argument the union has is that the mill is importing pulp from Indonesia. A firm which will provide competition to the other two is importing pulp from Indonesia, but it has nothing to do with the Moora pulp mill. Using misinformation, the union is trying to destroy this pulp mill before it starts. If we can have value adding, let us have it. Let the unions help get these enterprises going and not destroy them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my motion I also referred to interest rates. I know that interest rates are lower now, but the fact is that the best rate a person can get as a lender to the bank is about 8.3 per cent, as of Monday. The rate has not come down because the banks anticipated it. On the same day the prime rate was 13.5 per cent. That is a mark-up of 63 per cent. If an item in a retail shop were to be marked up by 63 per cent, we would claim that the shop was having a lend of us. That is the prime lending rate. The banks are still charging farmers between 18 per cent and 19 per cent, which is a mark-up of 250 per cent. How are the banks helping the situation? What is the Government doing to encourage the banks to help the situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to waterfront reform, Senator Collins told us today that wheat is put through the ports much more quickly. I agree, but it has been a long time coming. There are still 600 or 700 men idle on the waterfront. They are being paid, and they are being paid by the rural industries. Those 600 or 700 idle men should be the responsibility of the whole community, not just the community that is using the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motion states that we lack a competitive international tax structure. Last March the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) brought down a statement that contained some measures that could help the rural industries. One was sales tax on lubricants and hand tools used in agriculture. There was provision for a better depreciation schedule, but where is the legislation? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who was responsible for bringing that statement into the Senate, is on duty in the chamber. I ask him: where is the necessary legislation? The statement was made in March&mdash;seven months ago&mdash;but we have not seen the legislation. The Government got the kudos for the March statement, which it said was the best industry statement ever. Where is the legislation to enable people to get the benefits of it? It has not been forthcoming. The Government makes these promises, they sound good in the press, but nothing comes to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Whip is looking to me to wind up. I give an indication that I will accept the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. As Senator Crane pointed out, the amendment does not change the motion. I agree to delete the words `to liberalise international trade', for one reason. The motion of condemnation of the Government is not altered one iota. The fact is that we disagree with the Democrats, but we will debate that in this place at another time. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer should not tell me that we are backing down by accepting this amendment. At this point, I ask that the question be put. </PARA>

<PARA>The decision of Rocklea to close the National Textiles spinning mill at Kotara, Newcastle, is to be condemned, particularly in view of the fact that it has just been announced that the mill is to receive a capitalisation grant of $15.9m. It is typical of the mismanagement of this Government that a company can buy a cotton spinning mill, receive a grant in respect of that mill for such a large amount of money and then calmly close the mill down, putting 327 people out of a job in a period when unemployment in this country is a cause of enormous concern. Meanwhile, the Government of the day, and particularly the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), sits back and washes its hands of the matter like Pontius Pilate saying, `In truth, the fact is that Kotara is an old, outdated plant and, whatever the Government did, it would have to close at some stage'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that I have to point out to the Minister that the whole purpose of the capitalisation grants scheme is to provide&mdash;I quote from the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority's annual report of 1989-90&mdash;`a further stimulus to the restructuring process'. Therefore, the entire purpose of the grant is to give industry an opportunity to restructure, to become more efficient and to contribute to the export potential of this country. Allowing a company to receive a grant and to then shut up the shop does not seem to be a tremendous stimulus for the restructuring process. The resulting action by Rocklea has in fact only served to harm the very people that it is supposed to be helping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By approving this grant, the Government appears to have forgotten the entire purpose of the scheme, showing yet again the Federal Labor Government's blatant lack of regard for those people employed in the manufacturing sector, particularly those in the Hunter region where the livelihood of so many depends upon the productivity of our secondary industries. It is contemptible that the Government can continue to turn its back on the people who have traditionally supported it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hunter region has the potential to be the engine-room of economic recovery in this country and to lead us out of the recession that Labor has decided to inflict upon us. When will the Government cease to betray the people of the Hunter region? Again and again, contract after contract has been awarded to cities other than Newcastle for purely political reasons, while the Labor Government shows a disregard for economic commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appalling that such a large amount of taxpayers' money, which was originally earmarked for an area which is most in need, can be granted to a private enterprise concern that can turn around and put it to a use in a way in which it was not intended to be used. It is of particular concern because the textile industry is a major employer of women in the Newcastle region. The closure of the National Textile spinning mill at Kotara will result in the loss of 327 jobs. These positions are predominantly held by women. The plight of women in the work force is arduous enough without the additional blow of having a large number of jobs for women in this region no longer available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people at the plant in Kotara, and the textile industry in general, can only watch in dismay as this Government slowly destroys the livelihood that they have struggled so long to maintain. `We blame the Government', the workers have been reported as saying. Another reaction of the workers is, `The Government says to buy Australian, but at this rate nothing will be made in Australia'. These people realise that this Government is not for the people. They quite rightly feel stunned that a Labor government can treat them with such thinly veiled contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is grave enough to provoke criticism from the more traditional supporters of the Labor Government, such as the union movement. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS>, in an interview with Ms Anna Booth, the Assistant Secretary of the Clothing and Allied Trade Unions of Australia, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the awarding of the grant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is absolutely not in the spirit of the bounty and industry development plan, which is for money to be spent to develop industries . . . For the grant to be given to a private company without any strings attached is against the letter of the industry development plan.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Labor Government has taken the people of the Hunter for granted by allowing a long established company and employer in the region to close down. The most remarkable aspect of this tragedy, however, is that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce had the means available to prevent this from occurring but neglected to do so, preferring instead to place ever more hardship on the people of the Hunter and increasing the already high number of unemployed people in this country. Upon approval of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, the capitalisation grant provided the opportunity for eligible textile yarn producers to receive a one-off, up-front grant in lieu of continued bounty receipts. A company's application for the grant must be supported by a business plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business plan must include stated business objectives in relation to the applicant's production of bountiable yarn; its export initiatives; occupational and environmental health safety issues; and the method of achieving these objectives with regard to restructuring, investment, research and development, financing, sales and marketing. This business plan, therefore, is very detailed. It provides the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority&mdash;and, through it, the Minister&mdash;with all necessary future projections and anticipated actions of the applicant. The TCF Development Authority, after considering the plan, recommends to the Minister whether to allow the grant. The key criteria by which these applications are assessed are whether the business plan will contribute to the restructuring and revitalisation of the textile, footwear and clothing industry and whether the grant will result in fewer budgetary outlays from the Commonwealth than would otherwise have been provided by ongoing bounty assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the grant is approved, which is the case with the National Textiles spinning mill, the applicant must enter into a capitalisation agreement with the Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth. The Minister has the authority to include in the agreement such terms and conditions as he sees fit in achieving the objectives of the business plan. The agreement must also specify the assets to be used by the applicant to achieve the goals of the business plan. Should the applicant wish to sell or lease any of these assets, permission must be obtained from the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To allow such a transaction as this to go ahead, the Minister must be satisfied that these assets are no longer required in meeting the goals of the business plan. Obviously, failure to meet the terms and conditions of the agreement will result in an amount of the grant having to be repaid. It would appear, therefore, that ensuring that the grant is properly bestowed would be a relatively easy matter, as most of what would be necessary for sensible people to administer the capitalisation grant program in a responsible fashion is already in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the details of the treatment of the manufacturing sector and the Government's lackadaisical approach in the monitoring of the most efficient and appropriate application of the $15.9m of taxpayers' money, it is obvious that there are only two possible conclusions to be reached regarding the decision to proceed with this grant. This is particularly so in the light of changes that must obviously have been made to the business plan and the capitalisation agreement. The first is that the Minister was fully aware of the plans of the new owner of the mill and therefore decided to put 327 people out of work, thereby pushing the role of women in the work force further into the background and adding to the woes of the people in the Newcastle region, so frequently neglected by this Labor Government. The alternative must be that the Minister is completely negligent in his responsibilities, as set out in the legislation introduced by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assuming that the Minister is aware of the requirements of his position, the question must be asked: exactly what would prompt the Minister to approve a grant of $15.9m to a company when it is obvious that the whole purpose of the purchase of National Textiles mill by Rocklea was to seize the grant and to reallocate the expenditure as it saw fit? Why create a situation which leads to the shutdown of a factory in the Hunter Valley that employs 327 people, adding to the dole queue, thus continuing to rip large chunks out of the economy and the region? Why not upgrade the technology of the production process, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the plant and therefore improving its export potential for this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is possible that the Minister is unaware of his responsibilities in the administration of the capitalisation grant program. If that is the case, it is appalling that this Government is taking such an indifferent attitude to the application of such an enormous amount of money that is supposed to be contributing to the revitalisation and reconstruction of the textile industry in this country. What is perhaps even more astounding is that the Minister, as reported in the press, has the gall to say that Rocklea should have consulted the workers before closing down the plant and that any future grants will depend on consultation with the unions. Does this mean that the grant in this case was originally given with no strings attached?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister already has the power to ensure that the recipient of a textile industry capitalisation grant complies with the textile, clothing and footwear industries development plan. Was the Minister ignorant of this power or did he in fact make the mistake in his decision to approve the grant? Now that the mistake has been realised, will the Minister recall the grant to ensure that the money is actually put to the use that was originally intended?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can clearly be observed is the need for tightening up the legislation involved so a no strings attached capitalisation grant&mdash;where the objectives of the grant can be ignored due to poor administration by the Government&mdash;can no longer be given out willy-nilly, thereby wasting taxpayers' money. Instead, an assurance has to be given by the Minister that he will do all in his power to ensure that this disgraceful misallocation of funds can never recur so that people in these industries are not further disadvantaged and so that the textile industry in this country is able to become more efficient without the blatant disregard of the people working in the industry that this Labor Government has shown. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tierney has made some fundamental errors in the statements he has made in support of his motion. Clearly, he has tried to confuse this important issue with the Opposition rhetoric that has dominated that side of the chamber for so long. It surprises me that the Opposition continues to dwell on unemployment concerns when clearly the Opposition will never pursue policies that encourage long term job growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant that was provided to Rocklea was not provided to prop it up but to help it become an internationally competitive company. From the very beginning of the agreement pertaining to this bounty, the restructuring of the business and the closure of Kotara were being discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capitalisation grants scheme has two basic aims: firstly, to encourage the emergence of an internationally competitive textile industry in Australia; and, secondly, to achieve budgetary savings to the Commonwealth. The grants to the yarn industry have provided an important boost to this sector of the economy. The capitalisation scheme merely allows those allowances to be paid in a lump sum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A grant of this nature in the form of the payment to YTM Pty Ltd&mdash;a subsidiary of Rocklea&mdash;actually saved the Commonwealth $2.8m because the grant was 15 per cent less than the total amount that would have to have been paid over the period that these bounties will remain. We must have in mind, of course, that they only continue until 1995. The decision to give this grant was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. In the development of a modern plant, which the grant will help establish, the company in question will be in a far better position to be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to some blatantly uninformed statements made by Senator Tierney. He claims that there are no safeguards in the issuing of this bounty and that there are no controls over the way that the money is spent. This is not the case, as the agreement at the time clearly stated that Rocklea had to maintain the aggregate production of the combined businesses&mdash;that is, Rocklea itself, plus National Textiles and Bradmill Textiles&mdash;until midway through 1995, which is the end of the bounty period anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bounty agreement, Rocklea had to also undertake a major modernisation program. If the company does not fulfil those requirements, it must pay the bounty back to the Government in full. Senator Tierney also states that the money should be put to the most productive use. That is what we are trying to ensure will happen. There are guidelines and rules, and Rocklea has to stick by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that workers were retrenched at this company, but it is obvious that, to fulfil the need to modernise and restructure, jobs will be made redundant. There is no longer any need for the Kotara plant. It has machinery that is 25 years old. There has been no investment in this factory for years. In fact, the Government has been injecting funds into this particular plant and subsidising it to the tune of 30 per cent to 35 per cent under the bounty scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the considerations in the restructuring of this enhanced Rocklea company, the retrenchment of employees was indeed taken into account and, after discussions and negotiations, a package for the workers from Kotara was decided upon. It provides sufficient notice of dismissal and a good financial package. Rocklea is also going to provide 30 new jobs that retrenched Kotara workers can apply for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does realise that there are complications when companies are involved in takeovers as far as employment issues are concerned. I certainly share the view of Minister Button that Rocklea should have consulted employees in a far more effective manner before and during the acquisition process that saw it gain control of National Textiles and Bradmill. Senator Button has written to the TCF Development Authority asking it to advise him of a more effective union consultation process in the restructuring of this sector. However, we must support our textile industry, and I see no reason why such a grant should not have been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has long claimed that more support should be given to business and industry. We have the record, we understand the issues, and we want to create real jobs, not artificial jobs. That requires a long term strategy, a strategy that this Government has continually stuck by. It is this Government that has made the tough decisions while the Opposition continues to mock and be opportunistic. The Government remains committed to the restructuring of the textile, clothing and footwear industries, even at a difficult time of economic recession, and will endeavour to provide maximum assistance to displaced employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, to support the motion moved by Senator Tierney relating to the closure of the National Textiles spinning mill at Kotara, Newcastle. It is a disastrous event for people to lose their jobs anywhere during such severe economic times and our thoughts must go out to those families whose breadwinners may well end up on the dole queues next year. However, the loss of some 327 jobs from the Newcastle area is particularly alarming as the region has already suffered badly. More job losses in the Hunter region are a further blow to the morale of an already depressed community, hard hit by the erosion of its manufacturing base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it is well-known that Australia has one of the most highly sex-segregated work forces in the world. Many women are employed in low status, low paying jobs and many of these jobs are to be found in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors. Indeed, some 65 per cent of the total employees in these industries are women. Hence, any job losses and contractions in the textile and clothing manufacturing bases will greatly affect women employees, as it has in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The closure in April next year of the spinning mill at Kotara near Newcastle, and the subsequent loss of jobs in a city scarred by a severely depressed job market at a time when Australia is experiencing a dreadful recession, is an absolutely appalling situation. When one understands and realises that the company instigating all of this is the recipient of a bountiful $15.9m because the Government's textile, clothing and footwear plan allows companies to receive an advance on the subsidies for capitalisation, the situation worsens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Government allow this to happen? Where are the controls and conditions that should be in place when the Government gives taxpayers' money to industry? The levels of assistance to textile, clothing and footwear industries are the highest in Australian manufacturing. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority reported in 1990 that, despite adjustments being made, these industries remain some of the most highly protected industries in Australia and that more adjustments are required if textile, clothing and footwear industries are to become internationally competitive. Surely, with this enormous assistance, the Government would make sure that safeguards would be in place to prevent occurrences such as the one at Kotara.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's March industry statement stressed the need for a rationalised, more competitive textile industry and announced that industry bounties would be reduced, ending finally in 1995. The Australian Democrats fully recognise the need to invest in new plant and equipment, to value-add our primary products and to engage in wide-ranging micro-economic reform to assist industry. But as the Metal Trades Industry Association has noted, cutting tariffs and bounties has exposed Australian manufacturing to international competition that it has not been prepared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform of Australia's transport infrastructure has not proceeded at the same pace and, whilst real gains have been made very recently on the waterfront, it is still plagued by inefficiency and outdated work practices at many docksides. The Government has sought to reform our industrial base from the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, we would submit that the Government's own economic policies have contributed to the closure at Kotara. Senator Button himself admitted that the Kotara spinning mill was `old and outdated' and that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this was the end result of the previous owner's failure year after year to invest in the plant and its future.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absurd for Senator Button to blame the previous owner for a failure to invest in plant, when for the last three years it has been government policy to maintain high interest rates. This is one of the major factors why business, and manufacturing in particular, has been hard-pressed to invest in new plant and equipment. Many small businesses in Australia are no doubt finding themselves in exactly the same situation as the previous owners of the Kotara plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats welcome the recent announcement of a one per cent cut in interest rates for business but would suggest that in the case of Kotara this is rather too late. I add that we believe this fall in official rates should be equally passed on to home owners, many of whom are no doubt now out of work owing to the Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was because the Kotara plant was old and run down that it was ripe for a takeover by Rocklea Spinning Mills which could then profit by the advanced bounty and improve its plant in Bendigo before the bounties ended in 1995. This is fine for the work force in Bendigo but the Newcastle workers have been abandoned. Certainly, Rocklea has offered them jobs in its Bendigo plant but many workers will be unable to move away for various reasons. To compound their misery, apart from brief advice to union officials in February, Rocklea had no further consultation with either the union or the employees before announcing the Kotara plant closure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although not specifically included in the guidelines for the capitalisation grants scheme under the textile, clothing and footwear plan, companies receiving assistance are now expected to have a labour management plan. The labour management plans have been mentioned by Senator Button and operate as follows: where employment reductions are involved, support will be conditional on recipients adopting a responsible labour management plan and minimising involuntary employment reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union's understanding of such a plan is that it should set out consultative arrangements between management and workers, how the project concerned will affect employment levels and how new changes in employment levels will be dealt with&mdash;including notification, redeployment, retraining, relocation, the use of labour adjustment packages and redundancy agreements. It should also deal with more general and ongoing issues such as consultation regarding work organisation, training and the introduction of new technology. Rocklea had no such plan. In the words of Senator Button:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bottom line in this is that a company receiving support from the taxpayer has a responsibility to consult openly about its plans.</PARA>
<PARA>It is too late for the workers at Rocklea's Kotara mill. Rocklea now has its $15.9m, yet it will close a cotton spinning plant and 327 people will be out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats call for a complete overhaul of the guidelines for administration of the bounty system. Taxpayers' money must have strings and accountability attaching to its use. The Government must bear the responsibility in this instance and ensure that in future it has more information as to how the funds will be used. The textile, clothing and footwear plan still has four years to run and we must prevent this situation happening again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I reiterate the support of the Australian Democrats for this motion and I hope that the Government learns from this bitter lesson. The people of Newcastle will not forget. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

I do not have a great deal of disagreement with those sorts of issues at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us return to the central issues of the Rocklea case. Senator Foreman has obviously not read the Newcastle newspapers or paid attention to other media outlets which have reported the comments of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the local members of parliament about what has happened. They were appalled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a number of points in his speech, Senator Foreman seemed to claim that there was some sort of consultation. I will point out some errors in what the honourable senator has said. When did that consultation happen? There was no lead-up to this. Newcastle was not aware that this plant was going to close. It took the local members of parliament by surprise and it certainly took the unions by surprise. It suddenly appeared out of the blue in the city newspaper reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plant happens to be located about 1,000 yards from where I live and local people were totally unaware that suddenly 300-odd jobs were going to disappear. I can assure the honourable senator that, when one tries to take jobs away from Newcastle, one knows about it in the media; just as the Government has known in the past in relation to the frigate contract, the submarine contract and even in relation to the AMSA&mdash;the sea safety centre&mdash;which it promised to give to Newcastle but, at the last minute, took away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When governments do this sort of thing to Newcastle, it gets up in arms. The issue ran through the media day after day for weeks on end&mdash;yet previously we had heard nothing; it was a total surprise. The matter was described as some of the most appalling handling ever of an industrial situation in this country. Even honourable senators on Senator Foreman's side have said they could not believe that this sort of thing would continue to happen in this century.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This company, without consultation, has acted like a corporate raider. It has taken over a company purely for the purpose of grabbing hold of this capitalisation grant. It then plans to transfer resources to Victoria away from Newcastle yet again and in the process shut down jobs in an area that is already massively depressed in terms of employment. The great tragedy in an industrial city where women find it very hard to get jobs is that 327 jobs that are mainly for women have disappeared. This Government, in the middle of a recession, should really hang its head in shame because through its lack of supervision it has created a situation where not only people including women have lost jobs but also this vital region has lost jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look back to the whole way that this capitalisation grant scheme is set up, we can see that this should not have happened. We have a situation where a firm has to put forward a business plan. I detailed in my speech what was needed in that business plan. How can a government that is properly supervising what is going on allow a grant to be given out to a company that obviously has not submitted a proper business plan? If it did, the Government has not scrutinised what the company was doing.

An `applied' Commonwealth offence is created when an offence that would normally be a State offence, such as armed robbery or assault, occurs on a Commonwealth place. To overcome an unintended consequence of the Constitution which did not allow State law to apply in those situations the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 which deems such offences to be Commonwealth offences.

They are part of the States' criminal calendar, not the Commonwealth's and they are normally prosecuted by State, as opposed to Commonwealth, Directors of Prosecution. Sentenced accused are State prisoners, and any fines realised go to State revenue. Part 1C of the Crimes Act 1914 in its initial stages will cause some operational difficulties to the States and Territories. The impact of Part 1C on the States would be considerably lessened if this amendment were effected.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. Section 60H of the Family Law Act at present prevents the Family Court from exercising jurisdiction in relation to a child who is the subject of child protection orders under State or Territory child welfare legislation. The policy to date has been to give priority to this legislation which protects abused or neglected children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Family Law Council has recommended that the Family Law Act should allow the Family Court to determine custody, guardianship, maintenance and access disputes where this would not interfere with the protection of the child by child welfare authorities. Following discussions with State and Territory Governments, it has been agreed that the Family Law Act and State referral of powers legislation should be amended to give the Family Court power to make custody, guardianship or access orders in respect of children subject to State or Territory child welfare laws provided the written consent of the relevant child welfare officer is obtained to the institution or continuation of the proceedings. The Family Court is also to have power to make maintenance orders in respect of children subject to child welfare legislation. The Bill makes the necessary amendments to the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 is to be amended to overcome certain problems arising from the operation of that section in the light of the High Court's decision in The Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Limited (1986) 161 CLR 254. The present terms of section 64 are that, in any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of the parties shall as nearly as possible be the same and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject. As a result of the High Court's decision in the Evans Deakin case, the Commonwealth may, in civil proceedings, in effect become bound by State or Territory legislation by which the enacting State or Territory itself is not bound. This may mean, for example, that the Commonwealth could become liable for damages for breaching a duty imposed by a State law that does not in its terms purport to apply either to the Commonwealth or to the enacting State. This goes beyond what appears to have been the original intention behind section 64.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the proposed amendments will be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, section 64 will not in effect make the Commonwealth subject to State or Territory legislation that does not bind the enacting State or Territory of its own force. This will remove the main anomaly exposed by the Evans Deakin case&mdash;that is, that the Commonwealth may in effect be bound by State or Territory legislation which the enacting State or Territory legislature has decided is not suitable to bind the State or Territory itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, section 64 will not make the Commonwealth liable for damages in an action for a breach of statutory duty under a prescribed law of a State or Territory. This will enable the Commonwealth, by prescribing a State or Territory law by regulation, to prevent itself from being sued for damages for breaching a duty under the law irrespective of whether the law binds the enacting State or Territory. A regulation prescribing a State or Territory law will only operate prospectively and will not remove any accrued rights against the Commonwealth. This mechanism is necessary to prevent the Commonwealth from becoming liable to possibly very large damages on the basis of new State or Territory laws which have been enacted primarily from a State viewpoint and without adequate regard to the Commonwealth's special needs or problems. A regulation will, of course, be subject to disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, in a suit to which a State is a party, section 64 will not give to another party, as against the State, any right that the party would not otherwise have. This amendment is being made at the request of the States. Section 64 in its present form purports to alter the statutory law applicable to the States in civil proceedings in federal jurisdiction. The Commonwealth agrees with the States that this is inappropriate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to question the Minister further with regard to the changes in the charging structure of the Civil Aviation Authority and particularly his answers to questions that I asked. During the Estimates Committee hearings reference was made to the costs being offset in terms of the increased charges by the fact that the excise had been removed off avtur fuel which is used in certain aircraft. At that time I also referred to those aircraft that use avgas. My understanding is that the excise has not been taken off those aircraft that were using avgas and that they are subject to significant increases in charges. In fact, their charges have gone up significantly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to aircraft using avtur gas, I asked a question of the Minister in Estimates to which I have been given an answer. I do not find the answer satisfactory in terms of the information it gives. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it correct that charges on 5,000 kg aircraft flying 1000 hours per annum had risen from $8,300 in 1988 to around $120,000 by 1990?</PARA>
<PARA>In the answer that has been given to me a case has been made which suggests that the costs are very much the same but that in real terms, because we are living with dollars that are approximately four years down the track, there has been a significant decrease. I would suggest that the figures used in this answer to calculate the position as against the position today are not accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one works through the figures that have been given to us and compares them with actual information that has been given to me by air operators one sees that, in fact, the real cost of the operation today should be in the order of $110,000 to $120,000 per aircraft. I suggest that the figures presented here of $85,000 to $94,000 are an underestimate of the actual figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have discussed this matter with a number of aircraft operators&mdash;particularly those operating in rural Australia because it impacts on the aircraft that are generally used there, not the larger ones&mdash;and the suggestion is that 1,000 flights each covering about 450 kilometres or 500 flights each covering about 900 kilometres is not a representative position. It appears that in terms of 1,000 hours of flying, the maximum that can be got out of these legs is about 400 trips, and that substantially changes the figures. If required I can table this example of the costs that arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to move to the end of the question which states that if it is related to the position four years ago, the figures would range from $85,000 to $95,000. I believe there is a fundamental flaw in those estimations. When one works through the figures, a figure of 21.25c for excise has been used. In actual fact, at the time, the excise was of the order of 16c and there needs to be a recalculation. In fact, the position which arises is that the costs for the operations of these aircraft in this arena are significantly higher today than they were when the changes were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone into some detail in putting this before the Minister. It may be necessary for the officers to do some recalculations. I do not believe that the figures that have been put before us represent the correct position. Nor do I believe that the basis on which the estimations have been made is realistic. I will let the Minister respond and then I will take up additional matters with him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that in the general sense, in real terms, the CAA has progressively decreased the charges that it is levying on the industry for each year that it has been in operation. I also know that not only is it the intention of the CAA, but also that it will have the capacity, to decrease each year, for the next few years, the overall level of charges levied on industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Crane would be aware, at the moment we are undertaking what is a difficult and very comprehensive complete restructuring of the Civil Aviation Authority. As I have said on previous occasions, most of the press and public attention is, probably not unreasonably, centred on the waterfront side of my portfolio. In fact, the changes that we are bringing about in the aviation area are just as unprecedented and as far reaching and, without question in my mind, as economically important for Australia as anything that is being done on the waterfront. I am sure that Senator Crane will be aware that there is a very substantial restructuring of the Civil Aviation Authority which is currently resulting in a very large number of its staff leaving and, of course, the installation of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new technology over the next four or five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I make that point is that the fundamental answer that the CAA has provided to Senator Crane is that the CAA has, in fact, produced a real saving to the industry of nearly $200m which was not the situation when it first took over four years ago. It asserts, as Senator Crane has indicated, that currently the level of charges that is being imposed on avtur aircraft is no greater than was previously imposed with the excise&mdash;the levy on the fuel. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to raise in regard to the Civil Aviation Authority concerns the position of operators who at certain times have problems paying the charges and fall behind. My understanding&mdash;and I would like this clarified&mdash;is that if an operator is having difficulties he can have his aircraft confiscated. What is the procedure in this situation? What leeway is given to people to allow them to catch up? This is particularly relevant to the case I have referred to, where an operator bought an aircraft which had some back payment debt on it. The debt to the Civil Aviation Authority went with the aircraft; it did not stay with the previous owner. The operator was unable to pick up the debt in time and he is now under threat of having that aircraft confiscated. In fact the debt really belongs to the previous operator. What is the policy position in that situation?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we are talking about CAA charges, not the FAC. It could well be that the seller of the aircraft had an arrangement with the buyer that the aircraft would be discounted by the purchaser being prepared to take responsibility for paying that debt. In another transaction in which I am involved fairly regularly&mdash;in the transfer of small businesses that have liquor licences, for example, where that is a real commercial asset and the original seller or the owner of the property may owe money to the liquor commission&mdash;it is not uncommon to have that taken into account. When the licence is renewed, the new owner then becomes obliged to pay that debt. I assume that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To answer the first part of Senator Crane's question, the Civil Aviation Authority certainly has the power to place liens over aircraft. They only ever do so as a last resort.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure Senator Crane, from my experience with a number of matters involving small operators particularly that have come up while I have been Minister, that the CAA does go to considerable lengths to assist companies, provided it is within the overall context that these debts are owed to the CAA and have to be paid. In my experience, the CAA certainly goes to extreme lengths to assist people in the industry in organising payments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the opportunity to take this matter further with the Minister. Before concluding on this matter, I would like to read the first paragraph of a letter I have received from an operator. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to my letter of 5 September 1991, I advise that the Civil Aviation Authority have taken their draconian powers another step further. I am advised that all of my aircraft are to be deregistered this month. I am at a loss to decide what to do, because it is not simply a matter of just going broke, as they have the liens over the aircraft for previous charges, which in some cases have absolutely nothing to do with me.</PARA>
<PARA>That is referring to the actual transfer. Clearly, when such a cost is included in the commercial transaction, I imagine that an operator with any business nous at all would offer a discount on the price to offset that, if it was being transferred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to accommodate Senator Crane privately in that respect. I make a general point to Senator Crane, although I am not suggesting for a minute that it applies to this particular case. First of all, I am obviously reluctant to speak in more specific terms because quite often in matters of this kind, as in the normal commercial world, legal action is afoot. As I discovered just recently in a matter that another senator was pursuing in relation to another organisation, not the CAA, in a series of questions that were asked&mdash;and I am not suggesting that this is the case with the matters raised by Senator Crane&mdash;the senator did not alert me to the fact that legal action was proceeding for recovery of the money and that the case was actually in court at the time the matter was being pursued. I subsequently discovered that. I think it is always wise, particularly having regard to the rights of the parties concerned, not to prejudice any legal action that might be afoot in canvassing these issues publicly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second general point I want to make, and again I am not suggesting that this applies to this specific case. It is often the case that, when aviation companies are in some financial difficulty, they deal on the basis of leaving the Government&mdash;that is, the CAA or the FAC or whoever&mdash;until last in trying to keep creditors from the door. As I have said many times before, it is an extremely difficult industry in which to operate successfully. I have said before that I would not personally be involved in it as an operator. One has to love flying. I regularly use some of the most efficient and professional operators, and I know that the overheads, the intense competition and so on in the industry mean that one has to be a good businessman to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty for organisations such as the FAC and the CAA&mdash;and the bottom line eventually does have to be reached&mdash;is that they are expected to treat all operators in the aviation industry in the same way. I can assure the honourable senator, from personal representations I have occasionally received, that other operators in the industry who may be in direct competition with the company involved are not particularly happy to find out that arrangements, at least allegedly, are being made to provide something that may not be extended to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that at the end of the day, despite the best efforts of the CAA and the FAC to accommodate people who may be in this situation, because no-one wants to see anyone go to the wall if they do not have to, those organisations do have an obligation to levy the charges and recover the costs that all operators know they have to pay in order to use the facilities provided by these organisations and on which their business depends. </PARA>

I wonder whether I could ask the attendant to take these papers to Senator Tambling. I have just torn out for him the lists of the concessionaires at both Darwin and Alice Springs airports. I have given an undertaking to Senator Tambling, which I will discharge, to give him, on a confidential basis, the rest of the page containing the remainder of the information he sought&mdash;that is, the dates that the leases have been executed and the actual state of each lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the cost to the FAC budget for interest or other costs to compensate concessionaires for the delays in opening Darwin and Alice Springs terminals, it is actually impossible at this stage to quantify that because the Federal Airports Corporation has conceded, in the Estimates Committee itself, that there may well be some compensation that has to be paid. I confirm that the Corporation is currently considering applications that have been made by two of the concessionaires as to claims for payments, but those negotiations are still under way. So the answer to Senator Tambling's question is that it is impossible to give a global figure at this stage because the matters are still under consideration. However, I can certainly give Senator Tambling an undertaking that, now that the dates of the opening of the two buildings have been set, the global figure&mdash;it will not be broken up into individual concerns&mdash;that is provided by the FAC in any negotiations that are concluded, will be provided to him publicly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into gory details, but to put it nicely in context for me, I must point out that recently I opened the airport terminal in Mackay, which is privately owned by the Mackay Port Authority. In Mackay I was interested to learn, quite independently of anything that had happened in the Northern Territory, that the negotiations between the Mackay Port Authority and the airlines over the leases to the buildings there were just as protracted and just as difficult as those over the leases for the Alice Springs and Darwin airport terminals. Perhaps Senator Tambling could jog my memory on the third matter raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The differences in costs between the north side and south side at Darwin airport for general aviation operators.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. There is in fact a schedule containing those amounts. Again, those figures are broken up into individual companies and, on the same basis and for the same reasons I have already given, I would much prefer to provide all that information to Senator Tambling on a confidential basis, which I will do. The general run of figures in an overall sense is that the valuations on the north side of the airport, which have been recommended by the Australian Valuation Office, range between $7 a square metre and $15 a square metre, depending on whether they are for heavy, medium or light use. Those figures cannot be relied upon because it is a matter of public record that the FAC, understanding the difficulties that some of the light aviation people are having, has made very significant offers of discounting and phasing in arrangements. I have no hesitation in saying again that until those negotiations have been completed with the companies concerned, first, it is simply not possible to give Senator Tambling an actual figure, because in some cases the figures have not yet been arrived at; and, secondly, in the case of the individual companies concerned, they would be commercially confidential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, those are the general terms of the north side leases which have been negotiated in that sort of range, and additional incentives are being provided to assist the operators in their move to the north side. That would compare with existing rental rates in what are, without question, compared with what is being offered now, very substandard facilities indeed. On the south side of the airport the figures are between $4 and $5 a square metre up to some higher figures, depending on what is provided by the FAC as part of those lease arrangements. Those are the broad figures and I have no difficulty in providing Senator Tambling with a breakdown of the detailed figures, company by company, on a commercially confidential basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, there has been a lot of publicity about this matter generated in the Northern Territory, a great deal of which has been inaccurate. I can fully understand the wishes of any company that is paying $X for anything not wanting to pay $X plus whatever it is. I can understand that. But as I have explained and demonstrated in the past, in the case of some operators who have claimed massive percentage increases for lease payments in moving from the south side to the north side of the airport, those percentage figures are totally misleading. Those operators have moved out of what are, in some cases, very grotty and cramped surroundings, and have asked not only for prime lots but also for areas of land that are five, six or 10 times in excess of the areas for which they are currently paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I can also advise Senator Tambling that I know of at least two operators who are in fact keen to move to the north side. They have already executed their arrangements with the FAC and paid deposits in terms of their commitment to move. I understand a third operator is also about to do that in the next 24 hours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for the information he has made available. I will briefly comment on each of the points that he has made. First, with regard to the list of tenancies at the Darwin and Alice Springs airports, I will be pleased to view privately the confidential information that the Minister has correctly withheld and I will respect that confidence. I ask that the same list that was handed to me here also be handed to the Committee Secretary so that it forms part of the official record of the Senate with regard to those particular concessions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue relates to the costs to the FAC budgets. The Minister has said that at the moment they are impossible to assess, but he will make publicly available the global figure when it is known, which I presume will be acknowledged when the dates of opening are finalised. The Minister has previously indicated that the opening date for Alice Springs will be 8 December and that for Darwin will be 14 December. I think it is important that that be acknowledged. There has been considerable speculation about the costs attributable to the various delays that have been caused by many factors in this whole area. It will be important for the public record that the additional costs are known so that people, including me, do not compound the figure unnecessarily. I appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the third issue, the Minister has outlined the ballpark figures relating to the lease charges that will be implemented for the movement of general aviation operators from the existing Darwin Airport site to the new north side facilities. I acknowledge that the facilities being provided are of a far superior standard to those that currently exist on the south side. It does concern me that on the figures that the Minister indicated, even after allowing for the various discounts and incentives that will be available, we will still be seeing the necessity, on a square metre basis, for lease costs to increase from between 50 per cent to 300 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I surely acknowledge that, if an operator chooses to take larger space than that from which he currently operates on the existing site, of course the operator will be up for the additional space allocation at whatever cost has to be negotiated. That is a reality of growth and changing to new facilities. But I think it will be of concern to many travellers, operators and business people in the Northern Territory that the operators, even if they took the same space requirement, would be up for additional lease rents, as I said, from 50 per cent to 300 per cent. That, of course, will be added to by the additional space that they take for their improved operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am still concerned that, during the Estimates Committee hearings, the Minister, and I think some of the officers, indicated that there were problems in facilitating the move across of a number of the general aviation operators before March 1992, when the technical head leases with the Department of Defence expire on the existing sites. It will be very unfortunate if the operation of general aviation in the Northern Territory, Darwin in particular, has to be split between two locations over an extensive period of time, particularly if the operators are not able to negotiate special arrangements in the interim period with the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Estimates Committee hearings I asked the FAC to attempt to accelerate and facilitate the moves and to ensure that even when it is no longer the landlord, after March 1992, no harsh and draconian actions are taken against any operator that would impact on the travelling public and which would affect so many people in northern Australia. This is important to the servicing of a large number of Aboriginal communities that use the general aviation facilities and also to a large number of tourists in the Northern Territory who access the general aviation tourist operations that currently operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have had a long saga of change in getting the new facilities at the terminals in Darwin and Alice Springs operating. I do not want to rehash that ground because the Minister has now announced firmly the opening and operational dates. I acknowledge that it will be great when the travelling public will be able to use those facilities. I sincerely hope that we will not see an ongoing saga in the general aviation area that extends over an equally long period of time such as that which had to apply to the more commercial operations. In that regard, I acknowledge the information that the Minister has made available both here and on a confidential basis. There is one other issue, of course, which I presume the Minister is holding back in order to give me separate information on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I advise Senator Tambling that I have been able to arrange for the drafting of a letter which will contain all of the commercially confidential information additional to what I have just given publicly. That will be in the chamber in half an hour and I will pass it to Senator Tambling. I am delighted to hear from Senator Tambling that he has been pressing the FAC to accelerate the move to the north side by the general aviation people. I must have been out of town that day and missed that statement, but I am delighted to hear that is his view; it is mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to take the entire blame for the delay that has been occasioned so far in the FAC accelerating this process. The FAC has been quite tense with me lately over this issue. It has soured otherwise good relations between us quite a bit. The FAC, I can assure Senator Tambling, has been consistent in wanting to accelerate this move of general aviation over to the north side of the airport. The one fly in the ointment consistently has been me and I freely confess it. Therefore, I am pleased to hear those words from Senator Tambling. I have been occasioning the only delay in that I asked the FAC to delay the official move until I had an opportunity to speak personally to operators, which I have done, and to ensure that the maximum amount of assistance was given to them. I have to say that I have been impressed with the steps the FAC has taken to assist the light aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that I make these points is that I received today what I consider to be a quite extraordinary letter on this issue from the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works, Mr Finch. If I had it with me in the chamber, I would table it. Mr Finch indicated that he would be at the opening of the two terminals, whether he was invited or not. Perhaps in response to that, I could just say that I was astonished at the letter because of what I have said in the past. He made reference in the letter to my statement in parliament that I hoped he would not have the hide to turn up at the opening of these terminals, considering the five-year campaign waged against the FAC and these terminals. I want to make it clear that I have no role to play in the invitations that are being issued by the FAC. It is its terminal; it is its opening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been invited to participate in the opening and have been delighted to accept. The invitations will be issued by the FAC and not by me, so I will have to refer Mr Finch's letter to the Corporation. It will be delightful to see him at the opening of the Darwin Airport terminal, in view of the fact that to this point he has never stuck his nose inside the building. I have always thought that was extraordinary considering, first, that he lives five minutes by road away from the front entrance of the building, and, secondly, that he came as far as the Northern Territory's road improvements. He was being watched by FAC employees at the airport who were taking bets on whether he would step across to the FAC side of the road to come up to look at the terminal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no bones about saying that I think that it is one of the most small-minded performances from a politician that I have seen. Senator Tambling&mdash;and I have publicly acknowledged the efforts he has made over these airport terminals in the past&mdash;has gladly accepted the invitations that he has received and has visited both projects. I know that he was impressed with the buildings both at Alice Springs and Darwin. But the responsible Minister in the Northern Territory, Mr Finch, has railed against these projects for five years and deliberately has never set foot inside these buildings at any stage of their construction, despite the fact that he is the Northern Territory Minister most closely associated with these desperately needed airport facilities. I will not be inviting him because it is not my role to invite anybody, but I will be delighted to see Mr Finch at the opening of the Darwin Airport terminal because it will be the first time that he has set foot in this facility since construction work started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I make that point is that it has been a long hard slog to get these terminals established. We know what it cost the Labor Party politically. We had a rerun, by courtesy of the CLP, of the television pictures of the Prime Minister driving a bulldozer and turning the first sod in every election campaign thereafter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and he did it well too. The facts are&mdash;and I have said this publicly before and do not mind saying it again&mdash;that the Alice Springs terminal is certainly a commercial terminal. The reason for that is that currently it does not require a very expensive international facility to be provided for what in Darwin are a relatively small number of international flights. Alice Springs has twice the passengers that Darwin Airport has because few are originating passengers. Alice Springs has become an extremely important aviation hub in Australia, I am delighted to say. It connects the west coast with the east coast and, indeed, the north coast with the south coast. It has become an attractive holiday package for people to transit through Alice Springs and to see the entire country by virtue of air travel in a matter of a week. Because of that the revenue from the terminal is good due to the extensive use of the terminal, but the facilities that have to be provided are not so great as they are in Darwin because they are mostly transit passengers through Alice Springs rather than originating passengers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very difficult battle indeed to get the FAC to accept Darwin on its list. In the end the Federal Government only did so through a lot of blood, sweat and tears. I personally put 10 years of political effort into this project, which no doubt is why I become a little agitated at times about the non-stop bucketing of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facilities are there. I am pleased to say&mdash;and I know that Senator Tambling will agree with this assessment&mdash;that both buildings are magnificent. I am delighted that the design at Darwin has been so spectacularly successful. The arched roof entrance of the foyer, with a veranda style opening to the terminal, will make Darwin one of the more attractive terminals&mdash;I do not want to be too Top End parochial&mdash;in Australia. One cannot overstate the importance of these assets to one of our now most important industries, the tourist industry of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that I do not have to urge Senator Tambling to do so, but I would certainly urge on his colleague Mr Finch to stop his nonsense. This included an unbelievable performance only a couple of weeks ago when he declared that he, as Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Works, was to close one of the access roads into the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an even more disgraceful performance&mdash;I can now fully tell the story for the first time; I could not tell it at the time&mdash;when in the middle of the project the firm of John Holland was desperately trying to finish as much of the exterior work as possible before the wet season, before the rain started, so that they could complete the internal work in the building, stories were peddled by Mr Finch and his office. I was told this personally by two Darwin journalists who had been the recipients of these stories. It was said that John Holland was about to go broke and this caused all the supplies to the airport terminals to be frozen for 24 hours by the suppliers. The opinion in John Holland at that time as to what went on was not fit to print. John Holland had done an extraordinary job on this airport terminal which was on budget, ahead of time and resulted in a beautifully finished building. This was at a time when the firm was racing the clouds and the wet season to get the work finished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These stories were coming out of the relevant Northern Territory Minister's office, and I made that public. But what I have not made public is that the suppliers were so agitated at the source of these stories that they refused to release any supplies to the airport terminal construction site for a full day until the matter was laid to rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I had to do, and I thought this was ridiculous, was to take a team of journalists out to the building with television crews so that they could actually film concrete being poured to counteract the stories that were being peddled from the Minister's office that all concrete pours had ceased at the building because John Holland was about to go under. On that occasion I even had to ring the Chief Minister's office to protest about it. I thought it was a disgraceful action for a Northern Territory Minister to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that all those shenanigans and closing of roads will stop and that the Northern Territory Government will get behind the Commonwealth Government to make the opening of these terminals the same extraordinary success as the port authority in Mackay succeeded in doing, as Senator Macdonald will testify, when pretty close to 30,000 people turned out for the opening. It was a tremendous promotional exercise for the district. I hope that everybody cooperates in making sure that the opening of the terminals at Darwin and Alice Springs will be equally successful as a promotion for the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of Dr Battersby's remuneration has been declared to be commercially confidential. I can only reiterate that I support that position. I indicated before the adjournment that if Dr Battersby herself had no difficulty in having the matter disclosed I would have no difficulty. I said that for a very important reason. Dr Battersby operates in a highly competitive market of consultants who provide art advice to a whole range of organisations in Australia. It is a very competitive market indeed. It would be utterly detrimental to that individual in terms of her own business to have the rates that she has negotiated with the FAC made public. Her competitors would be delighted at that information being revealed. Despite Senator Tambling's assertion, I must assure him, as I thought would be obvious, that in a very competitive private industry the sorts of rates that are negotiated with clients can be of enormous value to one's competitors. That is the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC has assured me&mdash;and having seen the figures, I can certainly assure Senator Tambling that they demonstrate this to my satisfaction, although I have to say that Dr Battersby probably will not even like me delivering this&mdash;that the rates being paid to Dr Battersby are not only absolutely standard for the industry but are in the middle range of consultancy rates that are charged by other consultants in this highly competitive area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must take issue with the Minister on this point. The answer given to the Committee contained a statement by the Federal Airports Corporation that Dr Battersby's remuneration details were negotiated by her with the Corporation on the basis of similar contractual conditions currently applying in the art industry. Whilst the Minister has said that the rate is standard and in the middle range of other consultancies and, therefore, ought not invite any invidious comparison, he has not indicated whether Dr Battersby is in any way engaged on a percentage fee basis, whether a fixed salary or consultancy fee has been negotiated and how that applies with regard to the extent of the work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answers that I received some time ago about the Alice Springs and Darwin airports, I was advised that the budget allocations for the provision of art works were of the order of one per cent of the contract for those buildings. Whilst I have received in the second part of the answer the actual expenditure for the FAC throughout Australia, I have not received any breakdown of those figures or additional figures which relate to Dr Battersby's personal receipts or remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not share the Minister's concern about preserving confidentiality in this area. The Commonwealth Government negotiates with people in many other areas. Negotiations are always conducted on the basis of open tendering or contracting. Negotiations entered into by the Remuneration Tribunal or other organisations are open and information is available. I am not aware of any other statutory organisation or government department which keeps to itself the basis on which it engages consultants of this nature. I believe it is certainly not in the public interest for either the Minister or the Federal Airports Corporation to plead that information is in any way commercial-in-confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Battersby has been engaged by a public statutory corporation. The FAC would be well aware that it is common practice in all statutory corporations and government departments to make any of those contractual arrangements available in the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny forums or elsewhere. I merely indicate to the Minister that, if he believes that this matter requires this sort of secrecy, he will only invite further inquiry, whether by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts or other bodies of this Parliament, and unnecessarily expose the Federal Airports Corporation to detailed inquiry into the entire program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I said was totally consistent with what Senator Tambling said. Dr Battersby is employed in the middle range in terms of indications of interest provided by other people in this area. I am happy to indicate to Senator Tambling the broad arrangements, without stating the figures. Dr Battersby, who is eminently qualified to do this job with her experience in the art world and her role for years on the Australia Council, has an arrangement with the FAC where she is paid a flat salary&mdash;it is a relatively modest amount, might I say&mdash;for which she is required to provide general consultancy to the FAC on art matters generally; that is, totally outside of selecting or providing the art works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Battersby is on a percentage of the art works acquired, which is also a standard arrangement in that industry with that kind of consultancy. She is on a daily retainer when she is actually engaged in providing art and supervising its erection, as she has done just recently in the Northern Territory. That is the fundamental basis of the arrangement with Dr Battersby. It is a fairly normal arrangement. I must also say that, having seen the art works in the Northern Territory terminals, I think Dr Battersby has been spectacularly successful.

I do not think he has thought it through sufficiently. He complained that more local artists should have their work included in terminals. I was actually lobbied by people in the local art community in Darwin who said that the art works should be provided exclusively by Northern Territory artists. That would be a very detrimental policy for the FAC to adopt. Indeed, I might say that it would be detrimental to Territory artists. It would be an absolute nonsense to suggest that only local artists could provide art works for the buildings in their regions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of the Estimates Committee, at some incredible hour in the morning when the officers of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation were required to be present, we pursued a number of issues with the Minister and the Managing Director of the ABC, Mr David Hill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points I raised and pursued related to the sale of housing owned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I sought additional information with regard to a number of properties that had been sold. I asked for details of the values at which they had been sold, the dates on which they were sold, and how the calculations had been adopted. I received quite a comprehensive list of properties that have obviously been sold recently by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerned me most was that the Corporation had sold a number of these houses with valuation dates quite some considerable time before the date of sale. This is an issue I have raised in other estimates, across a number of other statutory authorities of the Government and several Government departments, including the Department of Administrative Services. What came out of the various inquiries I made of the ABC, the other departments and the agencies of government is that there is no consistent policy relating to the manner in which government housing is sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there are some general principles that have been struck largely between the Federal Government and the Northern Territory Trades and Labour Council, a number of the statutory authorities in particular have chosen to implement the sales schemes in different manners, particularly with regard to the date of valuation of a property. This concerns me. When we look at the various deals that have been struck under these arrangements with the Trades and Labour Council, we see that the great majority of properties have had valuations predated six months, 12 months or up to 18 months prior to the sale of the property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases, this has resulted in substantial differences between the contract value, or the sale price, and what ought to have been the current market value of the property at the date of sale. An example instanced recently affected the ABC in the Northern Territory where a property was sold for a figure in the vicinity of $90,000 but the valuation was just above $100,000. Because of several discounts and credits that were available under the schemes that had been negotiated, the sale price&mdash;given that it was a predated valuation&mdash;was about $90,000. From memory, the sale was consummated in April or May. Two months later, the staff member who purchased the property sold it on the open commercial market for $155,000&mdash;a 50 per cent capital gain. Of course, that issue received considerable media attention at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been concerned that, because of the administrative delays that have been cemented into the contracts by various departments or agencies such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, there have been considerable losses to the taxpayer. The purchaser has gained a particular advantage. In most of the schemes that have been put in place, they have the right to sell freely on the open market without constraint. I acknowledge that some departments have sales constraints on them. But when I analysed all the answers I received from the various statutory authorities and departments, those with constraints were in the minority; by far the great majority did not have constraints. In fact, the Department of Administrative Services has some 100 properties being offered for sale to tenants that are currently based on these retrospective valuations. The loss is quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the principles in this sort of market sale situation have in effect been seriously eroded, and to a very large extent these special deals that have been struck between the Federal Government and the unions are unhealthy. I appreciate that I cannot in any way step in and alter any of these contractual situations that have been negotiated. However, I call on the Federal Government to review this valuation process. No State or Territory government would be allowed to adopt this sort of process under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement for the sale of their Housing Commission stocks, which must be sold at current market value on the date of application by the tenant. This creates a tremendous anomaly in the sale of public housing that is available. On the one hand, we have tenants of Housing Commission homes who have to pay full market value for the houses they purchase under the agreements and the arrangements; on the other hand, public servants or employees of statutory authorities such as the ABC are given a special privileged situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I raised with Senator Bolkus in one of the Estimates committees was that I do not believe that statutory authorities such as the ABC, or even Government departments, have yet fully acknowledged that they are probably going to have to foot the bill for fringe benefits tax. They have allowed valuations for housing sales to be retrospective and there has been a period in between. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government or its agencies or its statutory authorities strike special deals with their employees and their unions, they should front up to their financial responsibilities under the fringe benefits tax, just as any private sector employer would have to do if it sold housing to its employees.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I instance people who work for mining companies or people in remote communities who negotiate housing arrangements. There would be no way in the world that the Australian Taxation Office would not pursue with a vengeance any private similar stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is incumbent on the Australian Broadcasting Commission to acknowledge and to recognise this. Has it discussed this matter with the Australian Taxation Office and has it had to pay any fringe benefits tax? Certainly, we need to be assured that, in any future sales of this nature that are negotiated around Australia, the Commonwealth does not avoid its proper responsibilities to the taxpayer, to the tenants of Housing Commission homes, and to the very employees it is seeking to serve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Estimates hearings I asked Mr Hill a question on editorial control in Radio Australia. I asked whether, in terms of the broadcasts going out through Radio Australia, skilled journalists had the final responsibility for what went out. In reply to my question Mr Hill said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The newsroom decides on the stories and then the broadcast officer with the language skills translates and it is broadcast. That system is unchanged, except that there has been a very long demarcation dispute that we are trying to overcome, which means that you have two different unions handling copy. We are optimistic that at last we are going to break through there, but apart from reducing the demarcation system whereby the newsroom decides editorially the news copy and the translator translates, that system will stay.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that that answer was strictly correct. In fact, there has been a substantial change in the position adopted previously by Radio Australia. I believe that editorial discipline and editorial control and responsibility are of extreme national importance, by virtue of the fact that Radio Australia broadcasts into the north Asia region, the south Asia region and the Pacific. There are international ramifications for Australia if the stories are not controlled, the disciplines are not there or we get the stories wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that Mr Hill's answer was strictly correct because on 12 August 1991 there was a significant change to the procedure adopted by Radio Australia. Prior to 12 August a chief subeditor and a duty editor had the final responsibility for determining the final stories and the order in which they went out through Radio Australia. This matter was raised with me by a couple of journalists from Radio Australia and I have checked it with a couple of others independently. A letter to me reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may be interested to know that under a system introduced to Radio Australia on August 12, 1991, the 50-year-old practice of experienced journalists deciding which stories are used by the foreign language services ceased. Since that date, the only control which Radio Australia journalists retain in determining the composition of foreign language news broadcasts is through the designation of certain stories as "must runs" i.e., that they must be used. However, we have been instructed to keep the number of `must run' stories to a bare minimum. The foreign language services are at liberty to select whatever other stories written by the journalists that they may wish to use from a common "pool" of stories. This amounts to a fundamental change in the operation of the newsroom and has resulted in considerable anguish among journalists about the appropriateness of some of the stories which have been selected for use in foreign language news broadcasts. It is a matter of great concern to the newsroom journalists at Radio Australia that foreign language broadcasts are now under the total control of persons who in many cases are not Australian citizens and who may not have Australia's interests at heart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am extremely concerned that these changes could sabotage the valuable role which Radio Australia can play in helping our nation to develop a better relationship with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to that, which is a journalist's interpretation, I also have a direction on information program coordinators which went out under the name of the General Manager of Radio Australia, Mr Broinowski. That spells out quite clearly that in future broadcast offices in each of the three regional services would carry out information program coordination in isolation from journalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the changes that have been made there are a lot more significant than Mr Hill led us to believe in the answer he gave to us in Estimates hearings. These changes concern me. I do not believe that, in the situation that exists now, there is a chief editor totally responsible for the selection of stories that go out through Radio Australia, as is indicated by the information I have presented. On top of that, I am also informed that, even with the changes that have been made, about 10 per cent of the `must run' stories have not been used under the current modus operandi. I regard that as being equally serious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not my main concern. My main concern is that Radio Australia is now operating without a chief editor in control of the editorial content of the stories that are broadcast. I ask the Minister to examine this issue. It is very serious and should be addressed, because it goes beyond the shores of Australia. It goes to our near neighbours, particularly countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, to name just two, and from time to time relations between Australia and those countries are at best rather tenuous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my answer to Senator Crane by commending and supporting Radio Australia on this particular change. It is an extremely sensible change which is designed to improve the attractiveness of what, I am pleased to say, is already an internationally renowned and very popular service in the areas to which it is broadcast. I understand perfectly the correspondence that the journalists in the newsroom have sent to Senator Crane. Indeed, I have seen a copy of it myself and I fully understand the reasons why they have done so. But I am sure that Senator Crane would appreciate the very sensible reasons why Radio Australia has chosen to change the arrangements in the way it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most obvious comparison I can draw with this arrangement which may be familiar to Senator Crane&mdash;it is certainly familiar to a number of people in this building&mdash;is the AAP news scan service which we are able to access on the computers in our offices. As Senator Crane would be aware, AAP provides two levels of stories in that news service: high and low. The arrangements at Radio Australia are a lot tighter than this, but that is a reasonable comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stories are sent out on the wire to the hundreds of newspapers that take that copy. The reason it is done that way&mdash;apart from having a pool of journalists accessing the stories&mdash;is that the high priority stories are clearly flagged with `high' to draw the attention of editors, subeditors, chiefs of staff and so on to the particularly newsworthy stories. But the actual choice as to what stories from that pool appear&mdash;particularly stories from the secondary pool of low priority stories&mdash;is made by local journalists in the regions they serve because they are best equipped and trained to know what stories their readers would find most interesting and newsworthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely why Radio Australia has made this change, and it is a commendable one. These broadcasters are specially trained people, not only selected for their linguistic skills but also obviously selected for their intimate knowledge of the culture and the regions to which they are broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude this answer by giving Senator Crane the statistical information which may be of interest to him and which is directly pertinent to his question. There are 38 broadcasters employed: 14 of them are in fact citizens of Australia; 23 of them are permanent residents of Australia, which means that they have actually been in this country for a significant period of time; and only one of these broadcasters is neither a citizen nor a permanent resident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `must run' stories are `must run' stories; the broadcasters are not allowed to alter any of the copy. They simply have to deliver it as it is written in the newsroom. All of the copy is prepared in the newsroom by Australian journalists, so the stories that are produced originally are all produced by Australian journalists. But the choice of which secondary stories to run is a matter for the skills of the broadcasters, who choose them according to what they believe would be interesting in the areas to which they are broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure Senator Crane that there is still overall editorial control of what goes out. I am concerned to hear his claim that 10 per cent of the `must run' stories are not run, because they must be run. If Senator Crane, or anyone else, can provide me with specific information supporting these claims, I can assure him that the matter will be investigated thoroughly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer the Minister to the answer provided on the question of plagiarism in the ABC. I asked this question of Mr Hill and, to his credit, he did appear to take it quite seriously. The answer that has been provided is a lengthy one which deals in particular with the Copyright Act and, to a lesser degree, with the guidelines. But the significant thing is that the ABC editorial and program policy guidelines, as amended to June 1991, contain no specific reference to the issue of plagiarism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister will recall that I raised the question because it had become very topical in the print media, with a particular journalist with the Fairfax organisation in Melbourne losing his position because he had plagiarised an English article. There had also been other examples of plagiarism in the print media. Many of us who had been listening to an interchange that occurred regularly between Paul Lyneham and Andrew Olle noted that there was never any reference or source given for information which, quite clearly, sometimes came from the print media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted, on the odd occasion I have heard that interchange between those two gentlemen since I raised the point, that Mr Lyneham has in fact acknowledged a particular journalist's by-line.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I am still concerned that no part of the answer which has been provided says that the guidelines ought to, or will be, amended in a timely way&mdash;or whatever the expression might be&mdash;so that there is a specific provision in the guidelines which people can readily see. In saying that I have noticed an improvement and that I am pleased Mr Hill took the matter seriously and that it has been answered in a serious way, I still think it would be a better solution to go one step further and include it in the guidelines. </PARA>

In terms of the notice given, there is extensive consultation between the authorities and the people in the industry who use this equipment. The phase-in period is generally structured so that it will not inconvenience people, as far as that can be done, and it will be phased in over time to the point where the equipment that is being used would in itself be obsolete.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question regarding country passenger services. I put the following questions on notice. Will AN maintain country passenger rail services and, if so, which ones? What is the subsidy provided to each service? In answer to the first two questions, the Minister said that the future of AN's former regional passenger service is under consideration following a determination by an independent arbiter who advised that the Adelaide to Mount Gambier line should not close. The Minister said that AN has advised that the existing rolling stock is life expired and cannot be used to reinstate service and consequently AN has been asked to provide advice on options available for the provision of a passenger service between Adelaide and Mount Gambier and other routes formerly served by AN's regional passengers. The Minister then went on to give the subsidy per passenger.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, when we get to Mount Gambier&mdash;I presume that is the Blue Lake service&mdash;we find that there is a subsidy per passenger of approximately $100. Considering the distance between Mount Gambier and Adelaide, one could just about fly that route for about $100. In the light of the rolling stock having been worn out, why does the Minister consider that that passenger service should be kept going?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received an answer to a question on notice, the story of which concerns the fact that we have been told by the Minister on various occasions&mdash;I think Mr Sharp, the shadow Minister for waterfront reform, has been told once or twice a day&mdash;that we are now coming to the end of the program for restructuring the waterfront.

If there are 600 or 700 men idle every day on the waterfront, I believe the responsibility for paying them should lie with the whole community rather than those who use the waterfront for freight purposes. Can the Minister tell me how he is going to handle that?</PARA>

That is, in fact, the sort of figure that one would expect to be the minimum needed on a waterfront. A level of idle time is always a component of waterfront operations because of the nature of the industry. The difficulty is that that is the case, and the reason why the option of casual labour is just not a workable option any more is that people no longer sling bags on their backs with hooks; they now operate very expensive and often very sophisticated equipment. The answer to the question is that it is around that figure which is quite a reasonable level for normal industry operations.</PARA></TALK.START>

We asked the questions and that solicited and brought forward the 24 recommendations arising from Mr Snowdon's conference in March.

I do not want to divert us on to that now, but I simply indicate that I do have some concern about what seems to be a misallocation of resources. Senator Bishop asked whether I wanted to complain about the volume of work; I do not expect the volume of work to change, but I think we may need to have a serious look at the allocation of the work, given that one committee is doing twice as many hours as all the others. That does not seem to be efficient use of staff time or of senators' time. But that is not an issue for debate here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To support Senator Bishop's remarks in that respect, I read with interest an article by Senator McMullan in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> two or three weeks ago about the role of Estimates committees. It generally came down to the line, `Well, there was a bit of effort in them, but really they are a pretty tiresome bore'. I guess if I were in government, if I were in Senator McMullan's shoes, I might feel a bit the same way. But I think it is quite an extraordinary thing to say because, as Senator Bishop has said, over the past few years the Estimates committee process has really proved itself to be an extraordinarily beneficial one&mdash;and not just for the political parties. I guess it always tends to help the Opposition rather than the Government, but it is not totally a one-way street. As a Senate, we have elicited a lot of information of great benefit to the general public. Indeed, one of the great problems in being a politician is that you spend your life being snowed by people who do not want you to know things that you ought to know if you are to represent your constituents properly. So, I must say I took some slight offence, some surprised offence, at Senator McMullan's remarks on the Estimates process. I thought it was a fairly inept thing for him to say. We all have the opportunity to be as time efficient as possible, and I think we all try to do that. As Senator Bishop says, the time spent in relation to particular <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Estimates committees is often simply a reflection of the significance of the matters with which we are dealing. We did take longer in Estimates A than the other committees, but what came out of that, right across the board in terms of all the departments and agencies with which we dealt, showed that it was really a time efficient process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of the amendments which I put relate to the multifunction polis. They are covered on pages 120 and 121 of the program performance statement of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. I think that over quite some time now I have stated my concern about the so-called MFP in Adelaide. We have seen recent reports in which the Japanese interests have indicated that they want guaranteed profits. We have seen other statements, both by the Premier of South Australia and by Japanese interests, that without some further inducement the MFP will not proceed. Prior to that and going back quite some considerable time I asked Senator Button a question in the Senate to which he replied that no government money would be spent on the MFP. For all these reasons, not least because a number of members of the Opposition, some in the South Australian Parliament&mdash;notably Jennifer Cashmore&mdash;and some in this Parliament to whom I have spoken privately, have expressed the sorts of concerns which I have expressed, namely, that the MFP is nothing more than a brave attempt to support the Premier of South Australia in his bid for the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two amendments that I have moved are to prevent good money going after bad. In relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 1), only a request can be made to the House of Representatives. This is a request to reduce the total amount. In relation to that, the total program element listed on page 120 is $1.978m. We are assuming that because the year is half over approximately half of that money would have been spent. So, clearly, we could not make a request that the total amount be removed. Accordingly, the request in this amendment is for a reduction to an amount of $989,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment is to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) and refers to the amount of $2.772m for a feasibility study into the multifunction polis which, we understand, has not yet commenced; therefore, no money has been expended. Accordingly, we are seeking the total removal of that $2.772m. </PARA>

In looking at the regulations that were made pursuant to the Bounty (Ships) Act 1980 and the requirements in the 1989 Act, we see the requirements for registration of a firm to be eligible for a bounty set out and that those requirements are in fact very strict and, in the first instance, are requirements that the Minister shall meet.

There is a prima facie case here that it is not done properly, that it is done in a sloppy manner and that the criterion has not been met. The Minister offers nothing in answer to the evidence that is on the record except bluster and frivolous comment that he is doing a great job.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to pick up a comment Senator Button made when he said that a claim against a company was sub judice. That is not strictly correct. In fact, I must support what Senator Bishop has said, because the fact that the company is in liquidation means that the claim against the company is a provable debt and is not, in a strict legal sense, sub judice because the admissibility of the proof of debt is something on which the liquidator rules. Clearly, because of that, Senator Button's argument is incorrect and the defence he has mounted against the very severe and important accusation by Senator Bishop is of course invalid. I think there is a lot of truth and a lot of importance in what Senator Bishop has said. For Senator Button merely to dismiss it by saying it is sub judice when that is not the case I think does Senator Bishop and the importance of this matter a grave disservice.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr Hardy, who is running the boat yard for him, has been involved previously in two companies which have gone into liquidation and he is now running this shipyard. It seems that Mr Cantor has come back to EFIC and asked for more money to be loaned to what he terms `potential clients', for guarantees to be given by EFIC, and for more bounty payments to be made because, according to his own evidence when he was interviewed on Channel 9, without EFIC, Austrade and the bounty payments he simply could not do business. </PARA>

Upon his making those contacts, Mr Cantor was suddenly no longer interested in making the equity investment in the Australian design company.

I have asked the Minister again and again to give me an undertaking that the likes of Mr Cantor will not be given more taxpayers' and government money; that he will not be given further loans; or, more particularly, that loans will not be made to people who will do business with him or the shipyard that he now has control of which is registered for bounty payments; and that he will not be paid the bounty payments from taxpayers' money in order that he can enjoy the lifestyle that we, as Australian people, seem to be providing him with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to return to two items dealt with in the Estimates hearings. I have already foreshadowed one which relates to the investigations branch and the statement in the subprogram that 532 cases were investigated during the year with suspected fraud involving $54.9m, and 45 commercial prosecutions were completed, returning $3.9m. The Committee considered that this was not exactly a</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>very good return. That prompted the question of how cost effective the investigation branch is, with the costs that are run up. We have ascertained that in simply challenging an AAT appeal, as was evidenced in one or two cases we have dealt with before, costs of around $15,000 can be run up to recover something in the vicinity of $200 to $300. </PARA>

It is, in fact, very meaningful. I asked how much each investigation has incurred to date&mdash;how much was involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably not as simple as that. These questions were raised at the hearing on 23 September. Some parts of them were taken on notice and answered. I will make a few points which might be helpful. The investigation subprogram has three separate functions: investigations, intelligence and prosecutions. In this last area of prosecutions there seems to be some misunderstanding. That section processes all briefs of evidence prepared by the whole operational area of the Australian Customs Service including those which are passed on to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Australian Government Solicitor for prosecution. Talking about aggregate figures, and trying to work out what this investigation subprogram costs and appropriate those costs individually to the results of individual prosecutions, is an exercise which cannot be done in the way Senator Bishop tried to do it in the course of the Senate Estimates, because of that much wider function of the prosecutions branch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of one or two other matters I can give the chamber further information. True, 532 investigation subprogram cases were initiated in 1990-91, of which 247 related to quarantine, fauna, prohibited imports and non-commercial revenue cases of that kind. These were not fraud cases at all. I remember that the former Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, brought in some seeds once and Customs questioned him about that. That was essentially a quarantine matter. It had to be investigated. It might have led to a prosecution. That is an example of the 247 cases to which I referred. Taking 247 from 532 leaves 285 which were commercial fraud cases initiated in the year, with an estimated $23.9m in revenue being avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These fraud cases typically take more than one year to complete, and the majority of them have not been completed at this time&mdash;or at any particular time. It is not meaningful to discuss costs and outcomes in respect of the fraud cases, just looking at it on a yearly snap like that. The figure of $54.9m that has been mentioned by Senator Bishop in respect of fraud cases relates to all cases handled or partially handled during 1990-91. It includes, for example, a major investigation still proceeding into the illegal diversion of spirits, with an estimated $20m in revenue avoided. Again, it is meaningless to compare fraud estimates with results achieved during the year, because many of the cases have just not been completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that this program is broken down into three components&mdash;investigation, intelligence and prosecution. The cost to run the investigation subprogram was $14.8m. In 1990-91, 327 commercial cases were completed in total. As well as the 45 cases that proceeded to prosecution, there were cases that were settled or handled by other means, such as administrative penalty or call up of duty owing. There were 130 cases where the evidence available did not justify action. I hope that is of some help to the honourable senator in understanding the program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Program performance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outcome for 1990-91</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subprogram initiated 532 investigation cases during the year, with suspected fraud involved totalling $54.9m.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not, as the additional information says, 285 commercial cases; this says that it initiated 532 cases during the year, with suspected fraud totalling $54.9m. It is not 285, as stated, and not with the remainder of them, that is, 247, concerned with quarantine, prohibited exports, fauna, et cetera. The program performance statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subprogram focus is now on large scale fraudulent and illegal activities. The administrative penalty option which was introduced in July 1989 has been used to handle the majority of smaller cases. Investigation cases on hand in 1990-91 tend to involve far higher fraud, are more resource intensive, and will take longer to resolve than the average case handled in previous years.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other customs prosecutions completed during the year total 538. Types of prosecutions involved include quarantine (303), prohibited imports (73), fauna (16), revenue&mdash;non commercial (83) and illicit stills (46).</PARA>
<PARA>It is not, as set out in the additional information, 247 cases, presumably to be subtracted from the 532, and not concerning any of the $54m potential recovery of fraud. The program performance statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information concerning suspect or unusual activity is reported in the normal course of their duties by officers throughout the ACS to the intelligence area of investigations. A total of 17,645 such reports were received in 1990-91. This information is assessed for its relevance, urgency and potential, and is distributed to other interested areas. Some form the basis of further research in the intelligence area and lead to the issue of more detailed and integrated intelligence reports. A total of 255 intelligence reports were prepared during the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five major `Strategic Threat Assessments' were completed (two conducted jointly with the Australian Federal Police) during 1990-91, and a further four are in progress. These assessments enable senior management to focus on perceived areas of threat and consider options and strategies available to counter them and improve operational effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>Very simply, the program performance statement deals quite succinctly with the three arms the Minister has just described, but none of those change the fact that his Department set out in these notes the information that 532 investigation cases were initiated during the year, with a total value of $54.9m, but that it managed to bring only 45 cases. In the event, as the Minister says, that some cases take longer to investigate and to bring to prosecution&mdash;and we were told that we could expect to see details of those in the statements for the coming year&mdash;equally it would apply that investigations commenced within the past two years ought to have come to fruition in this current year. In other words, whichever way we look at it, 45 out of 532 is a pretty lousy average, and to recover $3.9m when the Department is looking for $54.9m really is not a great batting average either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know how much was spent on investigations of those fraud cases, as distinct from the 538 quarantine, et cetera, cases and as distinct from the intelligence gathering. I want to know how much has been spent in plane flights, hotel bills, people being brought on as consultants, whatever the costs incurred are, to investigate those 532 cases. I want to know how much it cost to prosecute the 45 cases that were successful in getting back $3.9m, so that once again we can answer to the taxpayer the question: does this Government oversight its departments to get the taxpayer value for money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get a response from the Department that is at odds with its own program performance statements&mdash;which says that either statement is a lie&mdash;will not do.

It may well be that we are desperately in need of more qualified people to get a better result. That is a point we can explore in another place. I suppose one could be excused for not expecting there to be a job specification when I recall that the Minister gave us evidence that he employed a deputy secretary without even having a job specification. Perhaps I could recommend a new publication by CCH which is on how to recruit properly; it might be useful to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of triple dipping and the answer provided by Customs on this practice. To refresh people's minds as to what that practice is: it is where the appropriate form has been filled out with an error in it concerning the import of goods. The error is registered against not only the Customs agent as the individual who signs the form, but his firm as well and, more particularly, the importer himself. This practice was to be tested as to whether or not it was valid. That question was conveniently avoided by Customs granting a 100 per cent remission and therefore denying the AAT any jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we were informed that Customs has ceased this practice as and from the Walker case which was decided at the end of 1990. Indeed, the answer that is provided contains one of those nice equivocal points and says, in effect, that triple dipping no longer occurs where one of the parties accepts responsibility. Of course, the immediate question that comes to mind is what happens where no party admits responsibility. Presumably then, the triple dipping exercise still continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I am informed that triple dipping has occurred as late as in the case of Hanimex v. The Collector of Customs which was heard on 6 June 1991 and in Grain Processing Machinery Pty Ltd v. The Collector of Customs which was heard on 10 July 1991. There is a list of other cases. Indeed, even the cases that have been dealt with in the Minister's answer, where he says the action was commenced prior to the Walker case, the decision or hearing may have occurred after that time as in some of the cases I could go on to cite. The Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In November 1990 the ACS changed its practice of automatically reporting the responsibility of an error against each of the parties involved, the so called triple dipping registration scheme, to only recording the error against the party who has accepted responsibility for the error.</PARA>

The way in which they are penalised, just to refresh the Minister's memory, is that, when any of the people who have been a party to that particular transaction come up again, the number of black points tallied against that name determines the size of the remission that may or may not be given.

So, perhaps when we next meet on this issue, we could ask Customs to keep a list of those instances where no party accepts the particular responsibility and the practice still continues.

He is placed in particular hardship and his situation has been exacerbated as a result of the recession that this Government has designed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the period intervening between the Estimates hearings and today, I endeavoured, firstly through the Committee Secretary, Mr Hamburger, to obtain a copy of the Austrade report, at least in draft form. After much discussion one way and another, it was agreed that Austrade would make available to the Committee copies of the draft report after it had been seen by the board. That was to follow the return of the new Managing Director, Mr Evans, from overseas at the end of the October. I received the draft on Monday of this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite surprised when I went through the report to find that it had no financial statement in it and no list of consultants. I thereupon asked Mr Hamburger to inquire further as to when we could expect this material. He was told, and subsequently told me, that the financial statements were not in an appropriate form and Austrade had no intention of publishing a list of consultants. I decided to speak directly with an officer of Austrade and did so. After some deliberations, we were successful in obtaining a copy of the financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the question of the list of consultants is somewhat more difficult. I was told that it could not be made available for some days. I then said that I presumed Austrade would keep a list of consultants and I would be happy to receive, for the purposes of the Committee of the Whole, a list of all those people who had been employed as consultants and the cost, and that if the board subsequently wanted to sanitise or otherwise&mdash;again that wonderful phrase `commercial-in-confidence' &mdash;the purpose or the subject of the consultancy undertaken we could perhaps wait a few days for that if it was a difficult matter. That I thought was agreed to, until this morning, when I received a most amazing document that listed no names of consultants but simply the areas of consultancy. They add up to $6.869m; not a bad little consultancy bill&mdash;nearly $7m. There was a discussion as to why I thought the Committee and the Senate were entitled to see these lists. In report No. 309 tabled in this Parliament by the Public Accounts Committee, recommendation 5.31 acknowledged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that Commonwealth departments are required to report on the engagement of external consultants in their annual reports, providing details about the number of consultants engaged, the total amount paid to consultants and a description of the project that consultants were engaged to perform.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5.32 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that similar reporting provisions to those required by departments should be required only for statutory authorities that are budget-dependent.</PARA>
<PARA>To date, the Government has not, by way of a Finance minute, replied to this report; but the findings of the Committee were well researched and represent the views of both sides of the House. I presume that the Government will deal favourably with that report. Accordingly, I felt that it was only proper to be asking for that list, because that is the expression and the will of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come to the stage where we are looking at the appropriation for Austrade. I came upon another piece of information this morning that, quite frankly, appalled me. Mr Downer, my colleague in the other place, the shadow Minister for trade, had found it unusual that Mr Evans, the new Managing Director, and other officers in Austrade would not speak with him. He could think of a variety of reasons why that may be the case, except that one of those officers happened to be a friend of his and he would not speak to Mr Downer either. He found this very curious. </PARA>

On 1 November, Austrade moved out of the area of responsibility of DITAC and Senator Button and went into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. What he ascertained, and what I have ascertained, is that Senator Button instructed officers of Austrade not to speak to Mr Downer at all. I find that utterly preposterous. I ask the Minister: on what basis can he justify an instruction to officers in the Public Service not to speak to an elected member of this Parliament and somebody who is charged with the responsibility in that area?</PARA>

That was the first recollection I have about contact between Austrade and Mr Downer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I wish to make is that if a shadow Minister wants to talk to officers of my Department or officers of statutory authorities in my portfolio and in any other portfolio, most of them observe the courtesy of writing to me or the relevant Minister saying, `I would like to meet with these officers of the statutory authority or these officers of the Department'. Senator Bishop is not on the front bench, but I would like to let her know that most shadow Ministers do that. If a shadow Minister writes to me making such a request, I say yes as a matter of practice and principle. That never happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Mr Evans, as the new chief executive of Austrade, in the presence of some other Austrade officers said to me, `We think we should give a briefing to Mr Downer'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said, `No. Mr Downer has not sought a briefing'. I discussed it with Dr Blewett, under whose aegis Austrade was to come on 1 November. We agreed, as Ministers, that as soon as Dr Blewett took over responsibility for Austrade, Mr Downer, who had not requested a briefing of me, would be offered one by Austrade officers. That is what happened. So when Senator Bishop starts off by saying that what I have done, presumably, is preposterous, I apply that same adjective to the allegations which she has just made. </PARA>

As I said, amazing things happened on 1 November, and that meeting between Mr Downer and Mr Evans will, in fact, take place on Tuesday. So no water has flowed under the bridge and I can hope that the administration of Austrade in its new portfolio will somewhat improve. But, of course, we are still left with a situation where EFIC, which has been the financial arm of Austrade, remains in DITAC. We have some things that we want to ask now in that area as well.

The interest only payments that he will make in respect of that loan over the remaining period of the loan will amount to some $80,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am looking at page 23. I take it that the provision for fringe benefits tax could not be in that same line item. No doubt the Minister will provide me with the information as to where it is. Note 16 on page 27 of the accounts deals with borrowings. The report says that the reschedulings and borrowings were authorised by the Commonwealth and approvals for the borrowings were given by the Treasurer under section 79 of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985. However, subsequent to the execution of the borrowing documentation, the Attorney-General's Department issued a legal opinion in which it advised that it was outside the functions of the Commission to borrow to fund the Commonwealth's share of liabilities under national interest contracts. Although the contracts entered into remained valid pursuant to section 96 of the Act, the Commonwealth has reaffirmed its intention to indemnify the Commission against all losses incurred in relation to default under the forgiveness of such rescheduled debt and all costs relating to the borrowings. The report goes on to say that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act, which went through this chamber only recently, in fact will empower EFIC to borrow in relation to the national interest contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a problem with that statement. Section 96 of the Act, as I read it, can in no way validate an act by the old fund which was not authorised in the enabling legislation. Indeed, because I was of that view, I investigated the matter a little further. I understand that there was not a single legal opinion issued by the Attorney-General's Department as this note states; that in fact competing legal statements exist; that indeed it was DITAC that obtained the first legal opinion which stated that the borrowings were illegal. It obtained that opinion because of its exposure to the Kuwaiti loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I understand that another opinion was then sought from a more junior member of the Attorney-General's office which purports to say that maybe section 96 saves the borrowings. I ask the Minister to make both those legal opinions available to this chamber because it seems to me that what is required is further legislation to validate those borrowings. I ask that both those legal opinions be tabled. I understand one opinion is by Mr Peter Clay. I do not know the name of the author of the other opinion, except that he is more junior.

I would also like to see the competing opinion to see whether it in fact expresses a view that section 96 operates in any way to save those borrowings.

In fact, that is not so. Therefore, not only are we being misled but so is the Auditor-General.

In fact, if one reads section 96 one sees that it provides that, if the Commission, as it then was, failed to comply with a provision in the Act, that would not make the action itself invalid. That does not save the Commission in a situation where it has acted outside its powers. It cannot be saved by that provision.</PARA></TALK.START>

In respect of Mr McAlister's package, I have already answered&mdash;because Senator Bishop asked me&mdash;what element of the package I authorised. I told Senator Bishop the answer to that question about eight minutes ago. The answer to that question about eight minutes ago was that I had to approve the housing loan element of the package. That was referred to me. In so far as the other elements of the package are concerned, they were negotiated between Austrade and Mr McAlister. The details were all negotiated between them. I think that is as far as I can take the answer to Senator Bishop's question. But no doubt Senator Bishop will have another one.</PARA></TALK.START>

Let me say that Austrade was established as a statutory corporation, independent of the Public Service. Mr McAlister was paid a salary and conditions which, at the time of his appointment&mdash;not by me&mdash;were consistent as far as possible with the sort of commercial packages which were paid to chief executives in major companies, which Mr McAlister was before he came to Austrade.

<PARA>It goes on to offer a number of possible explanations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter remained all the way through the life of the examination of the contingent valuation survey. For example, it was subject to a discussion in a paper that appears to have been prepared in around April 1991. At that point the officer who produced this minute paper, at page 69 of volume 3, went into some detail about other contingent valuation surveys that had been conducted in Australia and the relationship between place of residence and the willingness to pay which is, of course, the basis of the contingent valuation survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that visitors to Fraser Island were identified as being more willing to pay than those who had not been there. Visitors to the Great Barrier Reef were more willing to pay to prevent the crown-of-thorns starfish than those who had not visited the reef. Yet in the minute paper from the Assistant Secretary of the research branch dated 2 April 1991, and contained on pages 67 to 68, it is noted that those who had not visited Kakadu National Park were willing to pay significantly less than those who had.

If this method is going to be used in future studies by the Resource Assessment Commission, it is very disconcerting that faith is being placed in a method of survey that cannot even replicate its results from one survey to another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, in the advice dated 2 April 1991 from Mr Clive Hamilton, the Assistant Secretary of the research branch, appearing on page 68 of the additional information, he suggests that one of the explanations may be that people close to the resource are more likely to know about the resource. If Mr Hamilton is indeed correct in proposing that explanation, that would seem to contradict the validity of the contingent valuation survey in respect of the Kakadu conservation area. In particular, it would tend to argue against the validity of that survey in respect of the mining of Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get to a situation where either the survey method, because it cannot replicate itself, is meaningless and irrelevant, or the survey method is accurate and shows that in the Kakadu inquiry we had sheer ignorance outweighing knowledge and preventing the extraction of a very valuable resource on behalf of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two options Senator O'Chee outlined are possible interpretations of the facts, but it was not an exhaustive list of the options. It is important to get the contingent valuation survey into some sort of perspective. It is an internationally accepted technique for attempting to measure the value people place on factors such as the environment. It is a technique the Resource Assessment Commission feels it has an obligation to assess and continue to endeavour to apply in the Australian context.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McMullan for that comment. As a result of the inquiry and the contingent valuation survey on Kakadu National Park, I think even the Resource Assessment Commission is saying that it is merely a tool, and not a definitive tool. But this was also the subject of discussion which was contained in the advices given by the Resource Assessment Commission. It is interesting to note that at some stage prior to the final report being brought out there was discussion in a memo from, I believe, Mr Clive Hamilton expressing some concern as to how it should be treated in the final report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot find the particular advice at hand immediately, and I will not delay the Committee over long by looking for it. From recollection, Mr Hamilton said, `We can't dump the contingent valuation survey because we'll look silly, but the results are peculiar and we can't put all our weight on them as well'. It seems very clear from that that at least within the Commission there were two schools of thought as to the value of this survey. Given that there were clearly two schools of thought as to the value of it, I think we need to have a very close look at whether we continue to use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I must take issue with a comment that Senator McMullan has made as to the wide use of the contingent valuation survey. Certainly, it has been widely used, but from the evidence contained in the advice of Ms Leanne Wilkes on 5 April 1991, it certainly has not been widely relied upon. I think there is a difference between its being widely used and being widely relied upon. For example, Anne Fisher who was interviewed on 12 March 1991&mdash;she is from Pennsylvania State University and, interestingly enough, is formerly from the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are relatively few examples in the US where CV results have actually influenced government decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>A report of another interview conducted with Mary Jo Keely on 28 February 1991 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Ms Keely, despite the fact that the US government funds many CV studies, this does not necessarily translate into the direct use of CV data for policy making.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear that although this stuff is done and the surveys are conducted in other places, they are not used as the basis of decision making. The question I raise, and the question I think many concerned taxpayers would raise, is: if they are not going to be used, why bother doing it at all?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the strangest instance of someone taking issue with me that I have seen. Senator O'Chee said, `I will take issue with Senator McMullan claiming that these are widely used' and then he started by saying that they certainly are widely used. I would have thought that should probably have been the end of the contribution. Nobody has claimed they are widely relied upon; it is a tool under international assessment as part of the tools of analysis used by decision makers as bodies around the world are endeavouring to grapple with the very complex elements of decision making in the areas into which we are all having to go due to the demands of the 1990s and beyond in order to balance environmental and development factors and other things.</PARA></TALK.START>

Also, under the subsectional heading `Other matters' we deal with growth in the Department, the duplication of tasks and advice provided by other departments, and so on. Those are relevant matters.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaders and representatives restated the commitment made at the October special Premiers' Conference to address the question of vertical fiscal imbalance with a view to reducing that imbalance while recognising the necessity for the Commonwealth to have adequate means to meet its national responsibility for effective macroeconomic management.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaders and representatives noted that work is progressing as planned for the final report to be presented to the November special Premiers' Conference. Although the examination of issues is not yet complete, some preliminary conclusions are.</PARA>
<PARA>The first issue relates to the following:</PARA>

My understanding is that the events of recent days, in particular the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), mean that, contrary to what was said in the Estimates hearings only two months ago by the First Assistant Secretary in charge of the Commonwealth-State Relations Secretariat, namely, that the income taxing option of giving the States back some income taxing powers would be considered in Perth, that option is no longer an option.</PARA></TALK.START>

The question was whether it would be possible to provide the Committee with updated data for the micro-economic model, including access to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Social Security data input. I also asked in what form the updated database would be made available. As I say, I have received the answer to that. It seems to have been left open whether the data will be made available.

The raw data is based on ABS data and information on commodity taxes. It is feasible to make available some part or all of the detailed database on request. There might be a charge for it. There is still some consideration about that process. I think that the current trend of thinking&mdash;it has not been finalised, as Senator Short said&mdash;is that it should be possible to make part or all of the database available. It is a new concept, a decision about which has not yet been finalised.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst that raw data has come basically from the household expenditure survey, plus the information on commodity taxes held within Treasury, the Minister will notice that the first paragraph of the answer says that this data has been subject to significant statistical manipulation by Treasury.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to a previous question of Senator Short's which did not arise in the Estimates&mdash;I think it was a question on notice, if I read this sheet correctly&mdash;we said that it was intended that full details of the modelling methodology would be published once the model is up and running.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I think that does relate to the methodology rather than the data. Therefore, I come back to the data. There are at least three things: there is the raw data; there is the manipulation&mdash;to use the Treasury's own words&mdash;that is done to the data; there is the modelling; and then there is the final outcome. Unless there is stage 2, which is the manipulation done to the raw data, it is not possible for anyone else to follow the process or to be able to examine and understand fully any modelling or any outcome result. Unless the Department is prepared to make available the manipulation and what has been done to the data, then it is not really providing anything worth while at all, in my view.

That is the information that is available at the moment. There is also the material provided today concerning the data, and I think that has gone a fair way towards meeting Senator Short's concerns. It is always possible to envisage that something could slip between the cracks; as I see it at the moment, that is unlikely.

My point is: why is such participation not a mandatory condition of the sale? To privatise the airlines, or any other government business undertaking, and to not make automatic provision for favourable employee share participation is, in my view&mdash;and certainly in the view of the coalition&mdash;a very significant detraction from the real advantages of privatisation, one fundamental value of which is to increase the spread of share ownership throughout the general community, and particularly to assist in the workplace participation and involvement of employees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to point out, and have it on the record of the Senate as a whole, how concerned I am&mdash;I know Senator Bishop as well as the coalition are concerned&mdash;at the inordinate, inexplicable delay in the legislative timetable to bring in the changes to the whole legislative structure of the Audit Office. As we learned to our amazement during the Estimates, the new arrangements will not be in place until 1 July 1993. Therefore, until that time the Audit Office is in a state of considerable flux, considerable confusion and considerable uncertainty. It is a very debilitating situation as regards its ability to carry out its work. I want to have on the record the coalition's very great concern at the absolutely inordinate delay in bringing forward this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reinforce or support the point that Senator Short has made. I want to put a very specific example as to why it is so important that the position of the National Audit Office be clarified. It has come to my attention in the last few days that a head of an agency has purchased a block of eight home units in Surfers Paradise which were used by departmental officers for so-called meetings and recreation leave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the devolution of power and decision making in the current system, the place of the Auditor-General becomes more vital. I understand that this block of units was sold two months ago and that the Department of Finance is fully aware of the facts of this matter. I ask Senator McMullan whether he would make inquiries&mdash;if these particular officers do not know&mdash;of the Department and let the chamber know which particular agency is involved in the purchase of this block of units on the Gold Coast. </PARA>

But my source of information is such that I believe beyond any reasonable doubt that I have not been misled in any way, shape or form on this matter. I would like a thorough investigation and this chamber to be informed. </PARA>

With the throwing of this allegation into the air, because it is so vague and could be attributed to any of dozens of people, I am concerned that when these allegations are made in these Estimates and appropriations processes, they have the potential to reflect on the integrity of a lot of honest people. The allegation gets publicity, but should it prove not to be correct the denial very rarely receives similar publicity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because it is late, I will deal with this matter in the most expeditious way I can. There are a couple of matters which need to be dealt with. I will not deal with the finding of the matter or the method in which it was dealt with before the Human Rights Commission, although I am aware of the manner in which it was settled. My concern relates to the method in which the matter was dealt with by Senate officers from the time of the incident, which was 1988, and the cost that has been incurred to the public purse because of the handling of the matter, which has resulted in the person concerned being given compensation under Comcare because she was too stressed to work. It meant that further cost was incurred because a replacement had to be hired in her place while she was off work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am concerned is that there is ample evidence supplied by a report written by Mr Cleaver Elliott, Clerk-Assistant (Management), on 20 October 1988, and a further report which was sought on 10 December 1990 from Mallesons Stephen Jaques and the manner in which these two reports were dealt with. The last page of Mr Elliott's report dated 20 October 1988 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the corroborated findings of offensive acts with a dildo and waiting outside the toilets for&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the person named&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">these findings must be placed in context. The context was after hours off duty, in a bar area to which entry was entirely voluntary and optional. In such circumstances I do not however propose to recommend charges. I do not condone these acts and it is clear that they do not reflect well on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the gentleman who is accused of the harassment. Mr Elliott went on to recommend that this person, who is still employed in this building in a position of seniority, be admonished for these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter was then referred to the Clerk who made a note that he was to be admonished. The provisions of the Act, as I understand them, say that that can be done only by a departmental head or by a Presiding Officer. In fact, it was meted out by a security controller. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Failure to take action has resulted in stress for the person concerned. She was finally put in a position where she had to take action. On 10 December, Mallesons Stephen Jaques reported in response to a request from Mr Vander Wyk for an appraisal of the evidence on both standards of proof&mdash;that is, balance of probabilities, which is the standard of proof applicable for harassment, and beyond reasonable doubt, which is the criminal standard that is applicable, as I said, for matters of a criminal nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to table, and perhaps have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the findings of Mr Richard Arthur. He found the facts proven in respect of two particular items of distinct harassment, one of which was of a physical nature. He found these matters proven on the balance of probability standard; he also found some of the charges proven on the higher beyond reasonable doubt standard. And yet still this matter was not dealt with in an expeditious manner and the person who perpetrated the offence is still employed in the same position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is, as I said, that the matter has been dealt with in such a way that the Department has incurred additional cost.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important, just for the purpose of replying to what was, in fact, found. After dealing with the evidence, the report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I consider that the incident occurred. The varying accounts given by K make it difficult to establish exactly what occurred. However, I do not regard those variations as being sufficient to put the incident as a whole into doubt. The proper finding must be that the incident was of a substantial nature and broadly as K alleges.</PARA>
<PARA>There are further findings through the report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">S did make an advance in K's room which was rejected by her. I consider that the circumstantial evidence of the events, both before and after the incident, do not leave room for doubt that K's account is substantially true. I have doubts that the incidents occurred as K alleges in her most detailed account, but I am satisfied that beyond a reasonable doubt S made a significant sexual advance to K in the room.</PARA>
<PARA>The findings are pretty straightforward. Finally the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . except to say that the application of a higher standard of proof in relation to certain allegations may well be appropriate in the context of section 56 of the Public Service Act, although I accept that proof on the balance of probabilities only is required in relation to a formal complaint of sexual harassment. In any event my own findings were reached firstly on the application of proof of the balance of probabilities and then subsequently beyond reasonable doubt. I did not approach the evidence with a variable standard.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the report criticises the earlier report by Mr Elliott that I mentioned on the basis that different standards of proof were applied. The report further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of section 78 of the Sexual Discrimination Act make it clear that it was not appropriate to apply the rules of evidence in relation to a complaint under that Act.</PARA>

I do not want to take the time of the Committee now, but I have a copy of an audit report from the Australian National Audit Office dated 24 September 1991, dealing with the fact that the Library breached section 83 of the Constitution in that the Library simply ran out of money to pay its salaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Bishop has just said is correct. The Australian National Audit Office has qualified the financial statements of the Department of the Parliamentary Library for the financial year ended 30 June 1991. The qualification relates to expenditure by the Library at the end of the 1990-91 Supply period which was in excess of its warrant authority and appropriation under the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1990-91. A breach of section 83 of the Constitution and the Audit Act 1901 therefore has occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Warrant authority pursuant to the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 1) 1990-91 was not received until 11 December 1990. The Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1990-91 had appropriated, in line with usual practice, five-twelfths of the anticipated 1990-91 administrative expenditure of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, plus salaries based on the paydays which would fall in the period for which Supply was expected, based on previous years experience, to be needed&mdash;that is, to the end of November. Because of the lateness of appropriations becoming available, Supply period funds were required to cover 12 paydays, as opposed to the 11 originally anticipated. The failure was in not monitoring expenditure closely and relating that to the clearly slower than usual passage of the Appropriation Bills through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Wednesday, 5 December 1990&mdash;the day before the additional payday&mdash;an approach was made to the President and the Speaker by the Parliamentary Librarian for an allocation of $300,000 from the joint advance to meet salary payments due on 6 December 1990. However, the salaries expenditure had already been processed by the Department of Finance on 3 December 1990, along with other expenditure, which combined to cause the breach of the Constitution and the Audit Act. The qualification affected approximately $200,000 of the Parliamentary Library's 1990-91 expenditure, or 2 per cent of the total. During this Supply period, Library expenditure against appropriations is being closely monitored by Library management and a similar situation will not arise in the future. </PARA>

As a result of the Caucus working party review of the reforms to Medicare, the Government has now agreed to commit up to $12 million to demonstration general practice grants in 1991-92, keeping in mind the general aims of the formal program due to commence on 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in this Bill have been subjected to a comprehensive review process and have been refined as a result of this process. I am therefore confident that the revised package of reforms will provide a sound basis for containing health expenditure and encouraging the more efficient use of health resources. It will address the problem of inappropriate service patterns and encourage a more selective use of medical services through the introduction of a judicious price signal while providing improved protection for families, the chronically ill and heavy users of medical services. Finally the reforms provide a clear signal that the Government supports the ongoing role of bulk billing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill would amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 in order to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduce benefits for out of hospital general practitioner attendance items provided to non cardholders and permit doctors who bulk bill non cardholders to raise charges (copayments) for the same services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">provide additional protection for concessional beneficiaries in circumstances where they cannot produce their card to a doctor as evidence of their status;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduce provisions for an additional payment to be made to doctors each time they bulk bill a non cardholder for these services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">expand the Medicare safety-net, and to permit "gap" costs for families to count towards the existing safety-net threshold of $246;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">include transitional provisions to protect individuals when the existing safety net arrangements which apply on a financial year basis are replaced retrospectively by a calendar year accounting period; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">provide for the indexation of certain amounts in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare benefit for prescribed out-of-hospital general practitioner consultation items for non-concessionary benefits would be reduced by $3.50 from 1 December 1991. This reduction would increase to $5 from 1 November 1992 and be indexed annually from then on. For bulk-billed services where the benefit is reduced, general practitioners would be able to charge non-concessionary patients a co-payment of up to $2.50. When the additional $1.00 fee for bulk billed services is added to the $2.50 maximum copayment, the net income for a doctor who bulk bills remains unaffected by these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the administrative efficiencies and lower costs which result from processing bulk billed claims compared with patient billed claims for general practice services. It also acknowledges that there are broader benefits which result from bulk billing in terms of cost control and in access to affordable medical services. The introduction through this Bill of an indexed $1.00 additional payment (known as the transaction fee) for each bulk billed service affected by the reduced benefit will recognise these advantages and send a clear signal to doctors that the Government supports bulk billing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attendance items affected by these reforms are defined in the Bill and would be prescribed in detail in regulations and would include the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">all vocationally registered general practitioner items for consultations in the surgery, home visits, and consultations in institutions and nursing homes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">all parallel consultation items for attendances by other than vocationally registered general practitioners;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">emergency after hours attendances; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GP attendances involving acupuncture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits for other items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule are unchanged by this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be exemptions from these changes for a range of concessional beneficiaries and, in most cases, their dependants and for those persons and families who become eligible for increased benefits in any year under the safety-net arrangements. Concessional beneficiaries are similar to those under the Pharmaceutical Benefits arrangements but will also extend to those persons entitled to medical care under sections 85 and 86 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following concessional beneficiaries and their dependants would be exempt;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs pensioners, including those persons who have retained some entitlements under the deeming provisions for savings introduced in the 1990 budget;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">most Social Security beneficiaries;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">persons receiving family allowance supplement in respect of a child;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">pensioners within the meaning of the National Health Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons with treatment entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act would also be exempt but this exemption will not extend to their dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament has enacted the Social Security (Disability &amp; Sickness Support) Amendment Act 1991 which will replace the sheltered employment allowance, the rehabilitation allowance and the invalid pension with the disability support pension and to replace sickness benefit with sickness allowance from 12 November 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security legislation which provides for necessary consequential amendments to the Health Insurance Act has been introduced into the Senate and certain provisions of that Bill are dependent on the passing of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill deals with new safety-net arrangements which are designed to protect families and individuals from excessive medical costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently individuals who incur out of pocket costs for gaps between the Medicare benefit and the Schedule Fee for out of hospital services totalling more than $246 (indexed) in a financial year are entitled to benefits to cover their gap costs up to 100% of the Schedule Fee for out of hospital services for the remainder of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The threshold would from 1 January 1992 apply to gap expenses incurred by a family as a whole rather than by each individual member of the family. The definition of a family would be that currently used for the safety-net applying in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Enrolling as a family would be voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current safety-net threshold of $246 for individuals would not change for persons who are not members of families and anyone who chooses not to be counted as part of a family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The safety-net year would change from the existing financial year to a calendar year basis. This would ensure the extra protection applies as soon as practicable. It would also bring the arrangements into line with those which apply to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The safety-net threshold would remain at its current level of $246 for 1992 and would be indexed thereafter annually. The level would be the same for both individuals and families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents a substantial improvement in protection for families. Under the current arrangements some families continue to pay gap costs for out of hospital services for some family members even when one or more members have exceeded the threshold figure. The new arrangements should bring relief to those families where one or more members has a chronic condition or who face unexpected high costs because of sudden serious illness in the family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change would reduce the maximum costs for out of hospital private medical services of a couple with two children from $984 to $246 a year where their doctors charge Schedule fees or less.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional provisions within the Bill provide for the protection of individuals for the period where existing safety net provisions, which apply on a financial year basis, would be overlapped by new provisions, applying retrospectively for the calendar year commencing 1 January 1991. The transitional provisions would take into account the reduction in benefit and the copayment which will apply from 1 December 1991 to 31 December 1991. These provisions also ensure that the potential for "double-dipping" is avoided as a result of the transitional overlap in safety net periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance Commission would recalculate the totals of individuals' patient contributions back to 1 January 1991 and then apply the current threshold of $246. Retrospective adjustments would be made, where necessary, to claims already processed for individuals who achieve the safety-net threshold under this transitional arrangement. People who received increased benefits after reaching the threshold in the period 1 July 1990 to 30 June 1991 would not be required to repay those benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill would also provide for indexation of the following: the maximum gap between the Schedule Fee and the Medicare Benefit; the safety-net threshold; the reduction to benefit for the prescribed GP services; the maximum copayment; and the additional fee for bulk billed services. Both the maximum gap and safety-net threshold are indexed under current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package of reforms provided for in this Bill represent future changes foreshadowed in the Budget papers; the most significant changes to Australia's health system since the introduction of Medicare. In order to ensure that the community understands the reasons for these changes and what effect they will have on the quality and efficiencies of general practice, $4 million has been allocated over the next two years for patient information and education purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly there are serious concerns about the cost to the community and the quality of care provided in general practice. The Government has commenced discussions with the medical profession to see how funding arrangements might be further amended to assist the profession in its appropriate role of improving standards of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the discussions is to enable both the profession and the Government to pursue their legitimate roles while ensuring that there is a greater synthesis between the two. It is the responsibility of the profession to set and supervise standards. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure the financing mechanisms permit access to necessary medical services while constraining costs to ensure the long term sustainability of Medicare and assisting the profession to provide high quality care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussions with the profession will centre around the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the use of practice grants to complement fee for service reimbursement. A practice grant would provide some remuneration to those general practices which choose to reduce their reliance on fee for service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would better target health benefits, since it would offer appropriate financial incentives for practices to engage in best practice care, provide financing arrangements to encourage better integration with the health system and to involve GPs in a wider range of activities. These could be funded through a trade off between providing funds for practice grants and providing funds for Schedule fee increases for GPs' services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to $12 million will be provided in 1991-92 to enable demonstration practice grants to be introduced as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, trialing of the use of practice budgets. Under this arrangement a budget is allocated to general practices to cover the costs of diagnostic services and pharmaceuticals. This could build on the Government's other reforms in pharmaceuticals, pathology and radiology. It could also facilitate the trade offs which GPs make between different approaches to the care of their patients and support the role of the GP as the co-ordinator of a network of care. It would be a different approach from that at the moment which relies on counselling by the Health Insurance Commission for doctors who by comparison with their peers appear to use excessive amounts of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, accreditation of general practices. The Government sees this as a natural development of the vocational registration arrangements. Those arrangements are a form of accreditation, but of individual practitioners. Accreditation would be a matter for the profession, but it could provide a framework within which many steps could be taken to address quality of care issues in general practice. These might include improved quality of training provided to GP trainees through links between accredited practice and academic Departments of general practice in medical schools. Similarly improved continuing education and quality assurance programs could result from these links.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourth, supply and distribution of medical practitioners. There are four major aspects for discussion. These are: medical immigration; output of medical schools; the distribution of medical practitioners; and developing alternatives for GPs to help reduce the oversupply problem in urban areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many other countries have acted to deal with excessive medical immigration. The situation in Australia is now such that it can no longer afford to permit relatively unrestricted entry of overseas medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifth, information technology. Information technology could substantially enhance the diagnostic and patient education roles of General Practitioners as well as improving the business management of practices. However, as with other diagnostic equipment the current structures of general practice mean that few practices have sufficient capital base to provide these facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over $400,000 has been provided in the 1991-92 Budget to support the work of the Review of Professional Indemnity Arrangements for Health Care Professionals. The Review, established by me in April 1991, will examine and report on current arrangements relating to professional indemnity insurance for health care professionals. It will also examine current experience with compensation for medical misadventure and any difficulties with these current arrangements including problems with service quality, coverage and benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Review will prepare a discussion paper, undertake widespread consultations and prepare a final report, with recommendations for reform, for consideration by the Government in the context of the 1992-93 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resources provided in the 1991-92 Budget will enable the Review to prepare its discussion paper, develop options, undertake national consultations, conduct a number of research projects and develop sound costings for possible reform options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reform of arrangements for compensation for medical misadventure could assist doctors to significantly improve the quality of care to patients while avoiding unnecessary diagnostic costs which arise from the practice of defensive medicine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reiterate that this Bill is to enact a number of changes designed to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable, and efficient universal health insurance system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the first step in addressing difficulties that exist not so much in our health insurance system as in our health care system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms contained in this Bill have been subjected to a comprehensive review process, and as a result of that process have been refined to ensure that they represent the most effective means of dealing with these difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look forward to the co-operation of the medical profession in addressing these difficult and complex issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">(NO. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Government's 1991-92 Budgetary measures, I bring before the House a Bill to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill rectifies what has previously been a deficiency in the Legislation, that enabled Medicare benefits to be paid when a medical practitioner rendered a medical service outside the scope of that medical practitioner's limited or restricted State or Territory registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes a new provision which ensures that a patient is fully informed concerning the non availability of Medicare entitlements before a medical service is rendered outside a medical practitioner's State or Territory registration. The Bill includes a provision which requires that a medical practitioner, before rendering a medical service outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration, will be required to give to the patient a notice advising that a Medicare benefit is not payable in respect of such a service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces a penalty provision where, if a medical practitioner who is required to so notify a patient fails to do so, then a penalty, set at a maximum of $2000 may apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also included in the Bill is a discretion for the payment of Medicare benefits, to ensure that patients are not disadvantaged by the proposed new arrangements. This will enable the payment of Medicare benefits for a medical service which is rendered by a medical practitioner outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration and where the medical practitioner fails to inform the patient that Medicare benefits are not payable. For example, such a provision would enable Medicare benefits to be paid where a medical practitioner acting outside that medical practitioner's State or Territory registration, was required to provide an emergency service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will be aware, that for some time, the Government has been reviewing the key elements of the Medicare arrangements and, in particular, concerns related to excessive servicing by some medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces a new penalty provision and new referral powers to a Medicare Participation Review Committee, which are considered necessary as deterrents to medical practitioners who render excessive services. These amendments are part of the Government's broad initiatives to control the costs of Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medical practitioners, under the current legislation, may be required to appear before a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry, which is a committee of medical colleagues, to justify the necessity of the medical services rendered. To the extent that a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry finds that the medical practitioner has excessively serviced, that medical practitioner may be required to repay such Medicare benefits to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth may not be required to pay Medicare benefits for such medical services. The Bill introduces a penalty, in addition to the non-payment or repayment of Medicare benefits, equal to the value of the Medicare payments in respect of those services, which have been found by a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry to have been rendered excessively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislation provides for the establishment of Medicare Participation Review Committees. Such Committees are empowered to review the continued participation of a medical practitioner in the Medicare arrangements, in certain circumstances, and may disqualify a medical practitioner from the Medicare arrangements for up to five years. The Bill introduces new provisions requiring that where a medical practitioner has been found to have rendered excessive services by a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry, and has incurred a penalty, on two or more occasions, then such a medical practitioner will be referred to a Medicare Participation Review Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 1 December 1991 new Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations will be implemented. From these Regulations, it has been common practice to produce the Medicare Benefits Schedule, which is used by medical practitioners in relation to billing patients under Medicare. The Australian National Audit Office, Efficiency Audit Report No. 26, on the Administration of the Medicare Benefits Schedule made four recommendations regarding presentational changes to the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The recommendations regarding the Medicare Benefits Schedule were, in substance, that it be restructured with more logical and appropriate headings to enable easier identification of the Medical Services Items, and thus be more `user friendly'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To implement the changes, the Bill introduces two technical amendments. These amendments will exclude the restrictive references in the current Legislation to the words "Parts" and "Divisions" to enable more appropriate terms to be used in dividing up the various medical services in the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations. These changes do not effect in any way the substance of the medical services that are itemised in the current Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A Request for Quotation (RFQ) to install a Local Area Network (LAN) at Tuggeranong was issued on 14 February 1991. The Request for Quotation was issued to cover 700 users&mdash;just over half the number of staff moving to the new complex. Staff not connected to the LAN would continue to be connected to a Wang network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final group of moves from the Woden offices to Tuggeranong occurred on the weekend 12/13 October. This move saw the completion of the physical connection of users to the LAN. Some minor adjustments were made to take account of changes in the number of staff  moving  into  the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">building modules where the LAN was to be installed. Some 770 users were in the event connected to the LAN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the physical connection of users has been finalised there is now a three month support period and a minimum of 12 month warranty from the date of acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The implementation of hardware and software has been completed. As can be expected with new technology some problems have occurred during the settling in period and are progressively being resolved as part of the support arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facilities will be upgraded and expanded to meet the Department's requirements with regard to the remaining users in the National Administration. The timetable for this extension has yet to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no budget over-run for the implementation of the facilities described in the Request for Quotation. The additional 70 users were supplied with equipment from a small LAN which was previously operating in Woden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The total cost of the RFQ for the LAN is $2,098,606 for hardware, software and services. The Request for Quotation, which was issued in accordance with DAS Contract PE40, was awarded to Siemens/Nixdorf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There were ten respondents to the Request for Quotation. Five bids were set aside as failing to meet mandatory conditions. A further two bids were not taken further after testing. The selected response was the `cheapest' of the three final bids taking into account the total cost of ownership including maintenance, network management support and training. </PARA>
