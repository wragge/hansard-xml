<TITLE>Telecommunications: Future Charges</TITLE>
<PARA> To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows that there is widespread community concern over the introduction of competition into Australia's telecommunications industry, and that ordinary consumers may be faced with higher prices and reduced services as a result. In particular, we are concerned about the impact on the affordability of telephone services for low income earners and rural consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> The petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should introduce legislation to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) protect ordinary consumers from increasing prices and decreasing service and to ensure that the telephone remains an affordable utility</PARA>
<PARA> (b) clearly define community service obligations of all telecommunications providers</PARA>
<PARA> (c) ensure that, regardless of the structural arrangements, a strong and viable government telecommunications carrier is maintained and continues to provide a universal, affordable service to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable President and senators in the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesmanlike leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:-</PARA>
<PARA>The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, etc. as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 March I reported to the Senate on the concern of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances with this instrument, which related to the drafting, subdelegation and review of discretions exercisable by public officials. The Committee has received a reply from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) which undertakes to amend the regulations to meet two of these concerns and to review the legislation in respect of a third. The Committee is grateful for this cooperation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the correspondence of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>...21 February 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Hon John Kerin MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Primary Industries and Energy</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Australian Horticultural Corporation (Export Control) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No.422. The Committee considered the Regulations at its meeting of 21 February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would appreciate your advice on the following matters-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In regulation 4 (a) there is a typographical error, the word ``applies appearing in place of what obviously should be ``apples.'' The Committee normally does not expressly draw attention to such oversights, unless they affect the substance of a provision. However, this is such a case as regulation 4 is one of the most important provisions in the whole scheme. There is also a typographical error in r.16 (f), which misspells the name of a friendly Pacific region country. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Regulation 14 provides that ``The (Australian Horticultural) Corporation may charge such fees as it considers necessary to enable it to recover costs that it incurs in controlling the export of horticultural products.'' The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether this provision is intended to sub-delegate the power in s.121(e) of the parent Act to make regulations imposing fees in relation to the registration of premises and other places. If so, your advice would be appreciated on the validity of such subdelegation. In this context the Committee notes that s.9(1) (e) of the parent Act refers to charges, which presumably are different to fees. There also appears to be no provision for the fees charged under r.14 to be subject to any kind of parliamentary scrutiny. They are apparently not required to be gazetted, tabled or subject to disallowance. The Committee would wish to know whether any of the fees contemplated by r.14 are mandatory imposts on any individual pursuing a livelihood in the horticultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Regulation 18 provides for rights of review to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a number of decisions. However, unless they are seen as part of refusing to grant a licence, it does not seem that the determination of a financial rating for a licensee in r.9 or decisions on excuses for a licensee being unable to export horticultural products in r.10 (2) (b) are reviewable. Similarly, there does not appear to be a right of review of any failure of the Corporation to approve credit assessors under r.15 (2). All of these decisions appear to have important commercial and livelihood implications. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Explanatory Statement is somewhat slight in that it does not give an explanation of the individual clauses in the regulations. This is not a minor point. For example, at the first dot point on page 1 the Explanatory Statement advises that the regulations may be extended to cover horticultural products which will be listed in a Schedule to the Regulations. In fact, this does not appear to be possible under the Regulations. Again, the first dot point on page 2 advises that licences are not required for some destinations (Antarctica, Christmas Island, Cocos Islands and various Pacific Islands) listed in a Schedule to the Regulations. There is no such Schedule. </PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your recent letter on possible deficiencies in the Australian Horticultural Corporation (Export Control) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No 422. </PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate the Committee's concern that this matter be addressed quickly and my Department is currently liaising with officers of the Attorney-General's Department on the legal matters you have raised. </PARA>
<PARA>I expect to be able to advise you shortly of corrective action taken in respect of the deficiencies noted by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours fraternally</PARA>

<PARA>Senator P Giles...15 May 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Standing Committee</PARA>
<PARA> Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Giles</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 21 February 1991 on the Australian Horticultural (Export Control) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1990 No. 422. </PARA>
<PARA>These Regulations were introduced to increase the simplicity and flexibility of the export control system operated for apples and pears under the now repealed Australian Horticultural Corporation (Apple and Pear Export Control) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1988 No. 187. The new Regulations also provide for the export licensing of other horticultural commodities, besides apples and pears, as are prescribed in the Regulations. Citrus is currently the only other commodity so prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA>My Department has sought the advice of the Attorney-General's Department on the matters you have raised and the potential impact they may have on the operation of the licensing system. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, in regard to the typographical errors, the Attorney-General's Department advises that it is the usual practice of the Courts to interpret legislation in accordance with its ordinary meaning. They believe the meaning of sub-clauses 4(a) and 16(f), in which these errors occur, is clear from the context and that these mistakes should therefore not affect the day to day operation of the Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, you ask whether Regulation 14 under which the Corporation is empowered to charge fees to recover the cost of controlling horticultural exports is an attempt to sub-delegate the power contained in section 121 of the Australian Horticultural Act 1987 (the Act). The legal authority for the wording of Regulation 14 is in fact sub-section 117(5) of the Act which states, inter alia,</PARA>
<PARA> ``the regulations may empower the Corporation to charge such fees as it considers necessary to enable it to recover costs that it incurs in controlling the export from Australia of horticultural products''. </PARA>
<PARA>The question of delegation under section 121 does not therefore arise. </PARA>
<PARA>There are no arrangements in either the Act or the Regulations for the publication and Parliamentary review of the fees that the Corporation may charge for its services. However, the Attorney-General's Department advises that the wording of sub-section 117(5) of the Act in conjunction with the general law precludes the Corporation from charging more than a reasonable amount for costs reasonably incurred. These fees must be paid by all persons wishing to obtain a license to export prescribed horticultural products and the Corporation has advised that the fee for a license is currently $500 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, you raise the rights of review by the Administrative Appeals Committee of Corporation decisions relating to the financial rating of licensees and the approval of credit assessors. </PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation is currently reviewing the export licensing system now it has been in operation for a period with a view to increasing its efficiency. Several areas have been identified which will require changes to the Regulations including, possibly, those sections dealing with the financial rating of exporters and the process of credit assessment. I therefore believe it is premature to consider amendment of the regulations at this time to provide for greater review rights in this area of the Corporation's decisionmaking, particularly as sub-clause 18(4) of the Regulations provides for Administrative Appeals Tribunal review of any conditions placed on an export license by the Corporation effecting the holder of a license. </PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation intends to put forward to my Department proposals for amendment of the Regulations by July 1991. I therefore propose that the matter of review of decisions and the typographical corrections suggested by your Committee be considered for inclusion as a package together with the changes requested by the Corporation at that time. The need for Parliamentary scrutiny of fees charged by the Corporation for administering the licensing system will also be considered at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I have attached for your information a revised Explanatory Statement giving an explanation of all the individual clauses in the Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours fraternally</PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will make a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to tidy up the legislation. Some of these will shorten the administrative decision process, consistent with the government's microeconomic reform initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will enable the joint authorities to delegate jointly to Commonwealth and State or Northern Territory officials the more routine administrative decisions that they are required to make under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. </PARA>
<PARA>It is intended that only decisions that do not diverge from established policy will be delegated. If there is any disagreement between the two officials involved on any matter to be decided, the matter must be referred back to Ministers for a decision. This amendment will streamline the administration of the offshore petroleum legislation without weakening ministerial authority over decisions made under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will also replace the requirement for holders of offshore petroleum titles to lodge securities with a mandatory requirement for titleholders to take out insurance against potential liabilities arising from their operations. Currently, the requirements for insurance while usually attached as a condition of grant or renewal of a title are not mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will reduce the administration costs borne by industry while ensuring that the community is well protected against any liabilities arising out of offshore petroleum operations. While we never have had a major spill from petroleum exploitation operations in this country, this action will ensure that, in the unlikely case that an oil spill does occur, that environmental clean up costs will be fully met by the operators and their insurers. </PARA>
<PARA>Seismic surveying undertaken by contractors on a speculative basis over offshore areas not held under a petroleum title is a valuable means of encouraging exploration. It encourages exploration companies to express interest in, and to bid for, exploration permits over these vacant areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Such action can only enhance the offshore search for petroleum in Australia. This Bill will provide an additional incentive for such operations by giving the designated authority the discretion to extend the confidentiality period for the basic information collected in such operations to up to five years prior to providing public access to the information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Great Barrier Reef is a national treasure which all responsible Australian governments must manage and protect from damage for all time. This Government has made it clear that there will be no exploration for petroleum in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park or the coastal area extending up to the low water mark. Exploration in the five petroleum exploration permits, granted under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, has been inactive since 1971 and operations were formally suspended in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the Government's commitment to a total ban on petroleum exploration in the park, continuation of the five permits was seen as anachronistic. The Government therefore announced its determination to terminate the permits on 26 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the two companies with permits in the Great Barrier Reef region, Chevron, has favourably responded to our request and agreed to voluntarily surrender their four exploration permits in the area which were held by their subsidiary Keydrill Australia Incorporated. This action demonstrates Chevron's standing as an environmentally concerned corporate citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will enable the Government to terminate the remaining permit in the region, Q/11P. </PARA>
<PARA>An amendment to section 130 of the Act is proposed to clarify an ambiguity that currently exists with respect to domestic gas phase royalties obtained from the North West Shelf project. The change is specifically intended to define that category of royalty that the Commonwealth agreed to transfer to Western Australia to ensure the long term viability of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) export phase of the North West Shelf project. </PARA>
<PARA>As it is currently drafted, no distinction is made in the legislation between Commonwealth royalties obtained from the domestic gas and LNG phases of the project. This ambiguity has been drawn to the attention of the Western Australian Government and they have indicated that they have no concerns in principle with the change. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also clarifies two minor possible ambiguities in the Act. First, a more precise definition of exploring for petroleum will ensure that all relevant operations are covered by the Act. Another amendment will clarify the obligations of a holder of an access authority to affected titleholders. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally the Bill will remove minor inconsistencies and overlap between the Act and the Crimes Act 1914 which have occurred because of amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 132 of the Act, which is now redundant because of recent amendments to the Crimes Act 1914, will be repealed. Other amendments will extend the scope of offences dealt with in sections 133 and 135 of the Act to cover inchoate offences. Another amendment to section 84 of the Act will remove an inconsistency with other parts of the Act by requiring that a person knowingly provides false or misleading information in the test for offences under the section. </PARA>
<PARA>None of the amendments have any significant financial impact although the amendment to section 130 of the Act may have the effect of deferring minimal payments of royalty to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) (ROYALTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Act 1967 to enable the efficient and correct determination of royalties from those areas subject to offshore petroleum royalties. Royalty is collected on a calendar month basis and is shared between the Commonwealth and the respective adjacent State. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the Government's decision last year to extend the coverage of the resource rent tax legislation to the Bass Strait region, the North West Shelf project, Australia's largest resource development, is the only producing region subject to the scope of this legislation. The Government's decision not to extend resource rent tax to the North West Shelf project was in recognition of the vast sums of financing involved in the infrastructure associated with the development, and the sensitivity surrounding the export phase of the project. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments are intended to clarify a number of matters of detail which are not specifically addressed by the legislation and give legislative support to administrative practices. They will, therefore, not add any further administrative burden on either government or the petroleum producers. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment will allow for an interim royalty to be paid by the producers in circumstances where full agreement on royalty arrangements has yet to be finalised between the parties. On finalisation of the royalty agreement, adjustments to the interim royalty paid will be made. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment will also enable any royalty payment that has been made by the producers to be considered as an interim payment until such time as the full details of the royalty calculation have been verified and accepted. The current provisions provide insufficient time to satisfactorily verify the information submitted by the producers, resulting in the potential for incorrect royalty payments to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the amendments will facilitate the adjustment to royalty in cases of overpayment or underpayment arising from the incorrect application or interpretation of an agreed or determined procedure contained within a royalty agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will not result in any additional administrative and compliance costs, but will provide added clarity of and certainty in the provisions. The impact of the proposed amendments are expected to be revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

It is a matter of principle, rather than any specific questions, that I wish to raise now. I wish to draw to your attention that when questions are taken on notice by any department, the answers come back to honourable senators and to the Estimates committees in dribs and drabs. When one wants to go back later to check on such answers, they are very hard to find because they are not included in Hansard. The purpose of my rising now is simply to ask whether in the future it would be possible for the indices of the answers which are returned after the reports are completed to be included in Hansard so that they can then be found on the data-soft base.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I sincerely beg your pardon; Senator Short did indeed take up the question in the Estimates hearing itself. He was equally deplored by the behaviour of Senator Coates and Senator Schacht on that occasion. The debate took a particular unpleasant turn when Senator Coates, having chosen to withdraw a motion which many of us found offensive, took the opportunity during the second reading debate to attack once again the institution of the Clerks in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of that, Senator Schacht backed him up. He came along as a non-member of the Committee for the purpose of joining in the attack on the first day of the hearings. If one reads the Hansard one sees that Senator Coates did not make much of a contribution to the rest of the hearings after that attack. If one reads yesterday's Hansard one sees that the contribution made by both Senator Coates and Senator Schacht concerning the way the Opposition handled the issue amounted to rather gratuitous and offensive insults. This was about on par with the calibre of the attack made during the Estimates hearings.</PARA>
<PARA> For instance, a reading of the Hansard shows that Senator Coates asked the Clerk whether he would itemise what amount of time during his working hours was spent in putting together articles subsequently published. Senator Coates did not take into account the voluntary extra time and hours spent and not remunerated. The attack had a mean and nasty aspect to it. Anyone who reads the entire Hansard will see that the substance of what they argued was not worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> It was seen to be a personal and very particularised attack. There was no substance at all to the arguments they put forward. Subsequently, we have received more material dealing with allegations-if I can call them that. But all in all, last evening when either Senator Schacht or Senator Coates said that the Clerk ably defended himself and really required no defence as it were from anybody else, he was quite right. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it absolutely reprehensible that anyone should make these assertions because one speaks up in favour of the institution of the Senate and the important part that it plays within the parliamentary system as we understand it, because one defends the right of an individual to exercise freedom of speech-as we have seen, the Government pays only lip service to it; with its proposed banning legislation it would like to abolish and, indeed, seems hell-bent on abolishing it-and because somebody exercises the right to use expertise and place that expertise into the public arena for the purposes of enhancing debate and available information. I find it not only outrageous but also offensive when those two honourable senators simply say to an honourable senator on this side of the House that they are in favour of freedom of speech and the right to publish, and that they are somehow behaving in a partisan way and are trying to protect some privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to place on the record that this whole incident and the way that this debate was raised were unseemly. The way it has been pursued is also unseemly. Any fair reading of the Hansard of the hearings and the debate that has taken place subsequently will show that two senators seem to be intent upon some sort of vendetta. This ought not reflect on the way that the rest of the Senate regards this institution. For instance, I note that last night Senator Schacht said that he would not weep any tears were the Senate to be abolished. Certainly the rest of Australia would not agree with that attitude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the role of the Clerks in this chamber is not a matter for government-and I am here as a government spokesman. It does not come, within our knowledge, as the first priority of 100,000 issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Individual senators are entitled to put their views both at the Estimates committees and in the Committee of the Whole; that is a simple right extended to all honourable senators. That entitlement takes a slightly different turn when Senator Bishop now says that the attacks on the Clerks were mean and nasty. That is an interesting comment coming from Senator Bishop, whom I watched on television in not this round of Estimates committees but the previous one. If I have ever seen crude, arrogant behaviour, I saw it then. Of my 10 years in the Senate watching Estimates committee interrogations, the treatment of public servants on that occasion was the worst performance ever. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard Senator Bishop demand to know the identity of a person who passed a note. I saw her harangue public servants, so much so that the Minister time and time again had to intervene. I regard it as a touch hypocritical that she should raise the question of interrogation being mean and nasty. </PARA>
<PARA> When I look at the Estimates committees as a whole, I am often surprised at how many Opposition senators just get the line right. They can draw the line between interrogation, pressing the point and trawling for information yet not trying to put public servants through an inquisition. I pay tribute to them today at how well they do that. They will go and have a cup of tea with the witnesses afterwards. It is not personal or anything else; it is a role of the Opposition at Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, Estimates committees are primarily a vehicle for oppositions. They serve a tremendously great purpose in keeping government departments on the ball. I believe that, in my portfolio, everyone in the defence forces who serves under me has immense courage. However, the only thing I have ever found them afraid of is the Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates committees are not just for honourable senators to exercise their magistrate court procedures and techniques. Fortunately or unfortunately, I was in a parallel Estimates committee and can neither confirm nor deny Senator Bishop's view of Senator Coates and Senator Schacht. I have also not read the Hansard subsequently; I do have slightly higher priorities. If Senator Bishop is pressing that point, as she is entitled to, she should have a look in the mirror and see whether she can see any of that meanness, nastiness and offensive behaviour reflected in her own behaviour at the previous Estimates committee. There have been many complaints about it. I did not raise it when that particular Estimates came up because Senator Bishop was absent and one does not raise such things in a person's absence. I would not have raised it today, but Senator Bishop has attacked people on our side of the chamber for their style. I am not talking about the substance of the questions because that is a matter--</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Bishop cannot have it both ways. She cannot say that Senator Schacht and Senator Coates approached a matter in a mean and nasty way- `reprehensible' was another word used-and then introduce the subsidiary argument that we are trying to cut off political debate. Seven years after she was found at Albury, she tries to ban a political party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for his critique. I am interested to note that he has not read the Hansard and so is unable to comment upon the substance or the style of the remarks. I note that he says he was in a parallel committee and was unable to see it but nonetheless was able to comment upon what he had not seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said very often, I never have any complaint with public servants who come before a committee and are willing and eager to answer questions so that there may be proper accountability to the Parliament. It is very interesting that, when I have been invited to address seminars where public servants are in attendance, as I do from time to time, I have actually had the question asked: `To whom do I owe my responsibility-to the Executive, that is, to my Minister, or to the Parliament?'. The fact that there is doubt in the minds of public servants, that they have to ask that question, I find quite astounding. I think more and more people know that the responsibility and the process of accountability belongs with the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, on the question of cooperation, and indeed, cooperating with the committees and having respect for the Parliament, I have also said before that the way the Government treats the Parliament through its manner of disdain or sometimes contempt rubs off on the attitude of people who serve it. I ask the Minister never to say that at any stage I have not acknowledged that within the Public Service there is just as much talent and ability as lies within the private sector. The ability and willingness of public servants to carry out their functions well is about the same. But I have said that the system under which the Public Service works means that we do not get the best results from the best people. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads the sort of evidence that is given by various public servants, whether or not it is under a cross-examination style of questioning, it becomes quite apparent who is on top of the material and who is not. Indeed, I think we will find that, more and more, the quality of information which is being proffered is improving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise for a slightly lighter diversion in the form of an apology. Last night in the course of my remarks I made some disparaging comments about the journal the Parliamentarian. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I view the Parliamentarian with a somewhat jaundiced view, because I have been a member of this place for 15 years and it has not once decided to mention anything that I have either said, done or been involved with. </PARA>
<PARA>I apologise to the publishers of the Parliamentarian for saying that. I draw all honourable senators' attention to the April 1990 edition, which contains an edited version of a paper I presented to the Second Conference of Australian Delegated Legislation Committees. It has a good photograph of me in it, and a good photograph of Senator McMullan. It is an excellent article, and I recommend it to all honourable senators. I do apologise to the Parliamentarian. The magazine I had intended to refer to, which has never mentioned me in 15 years, is the House Magazine. So I transfer all of those criticisms from the Parliamentarian to the House Magazine. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, made a few comments earlier which I feel that I must say something about. He mentioned the role of the Opposition in Estimates committees. With all due respect, surely that is also the role of government back bench senators. I am sure that Senator Ray remembers being on my Estimates Committee. I used to press very difficult questions to the public servants and to the Minister. I see that the Minister is shaking his head. He and I have different memories. I would not allow the nonsense to go on that is sometimes allowed to go on under certain other chairmen, as the Minister will recall, but if I thought a matter was genuinely being raised, I would allow it to be pressed to the limit. </PARA>
<PARA> It was always a pleasure to sit on an Estimates committee under Minister Walsh, as he then was, because he, as a Labor Minister, was delighted to have his public servants try to explain something which he thought was genuinely being raised. I think that is the role of the Ministers-to enable Estimates committees to raise difficult issues and either to have public servants explain them or to make a statement as to whether or not an issue is a policy matter. But to suggest that it is only the role of the Opposition to press the Public Service is failing to appreciate the benefit which Estimates committees can be to the Parliament and, indeed, to the administration of executive government in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I meant, though, that they exclude the ugly, Mr Chairman. On the other point that Senator Lewis made about the good old days when he was so tough in Estimates committees, I do have a selected memory because one can only put so many things into it. My only enduring memory is when we forced Estimates Committee C to meet on nine occasions for a total of about nine hours a meeting. Senator Lewis in the old chamber stormed out of the Chair demanding to see Peter Rae and saying that he was never going to reconvene the Committee. Nevertheless, 10 minutes later he did. That is my only memory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is this other point about Estimates committees that I think Senator Lewis should acknowledge. Given the numbers in this chamber there are approximately 32 or 33 members of the Opposition who are either on Estimates committees or who float around whereas the Government can barely provide 18 to serve across them when the Whips are excluded. That has changed the nature of Estimates committees just a little. Also, I suppose that people are conscious of time. Priority, at least in questioning, should be given to the Opposition, but Government members should not be excluded from asking questions or being involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I get back to my previous remarks about where the political joy and political advantage is. It is quite often in Estimates committees. Whilst I am not an enthusiastic supporter of the current committee system as it exists in this Parliament, because I think we have too many, if we decided to reduce the number of them, the last ones we would ever touch are the Estimates committees. I know the effect that the Estimates committees have on my public servants. They strive to get the documents better and strive to get their answers in on time. Senator Newman probably wins one or two points concerning inaccuracies or misunderstandings, but the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges supports us on that. So the public servants are trying very hard to do those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA> I add another factor that, if we can get answers on notice given during the year answered as promptly as possible, it will relieve some of the pressure on Estimate committee questions on notice and other questions. We could have an ongoing process during the year getting answers in a lot quicker and that will relieve a bit of the pressure in Estimates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an interesting question. We have always had that as a trade-off position. I have been involved in trade-offs in this chamber over Standing Orders. Honourable senators will see in the next week how dudded I was because all sorts of total reservations were put in that were never intended by Senator Colston and his colleagues when they brought in that procedure report in December 1989. Funnily enough, the attitude of most of my House of Representatives colleagues in the Ministry is not to oppose that course. My predecessor, Mr Beazley, would have loved to come up to Estimates Committee B and do battle with Senator Newman, Senator MacGibbon and co. He would have loved that discussion but that particular Estimates Committee would probably have never concluded because he would want to keep it going rather than finish it off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not say that every colleague of mine holds the same view. That position may come but I have to say that it may come with a rationalisation of committees. Why, apart from chauvinism, do we have a Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade? There are similar instances of duplication on the other side. If only we could get a rational role between the two chambers without infringing the rights of the two chambers as to where they concentrate. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives will never reintroduce Estimates committees. Mr Sinclair dumped them quite properly because they were becoming a farce in 1982 and we have never sought to resurrect them. This is the chamber for Estimates committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to get back to the Estimates of the Department of the Senate. However, I welcome the comments made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) about the Estimates committees. I have just been with a number of colleagues on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration where we have dealt with the whole issue of the Estimates committees. It was good to hear the Minister's very strong endorsement with regard to those committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, I would like to return to the Department of the Senate and some of the matters which have been raised in this chamber by Senator Coates and Senator Schacht. Firstly, I will make some comments about some issues which were raised during the actual hearings of Estimates Committee A in relation to a number of activities which were put on by the Department of the Senate. I refer to the exhibitions and a series of lectures that were put on by the Department of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been to two of the three lectures which have been held to mark the 1891 conference. I would like to say-and I think the President sought comments and reactions from senators at the Estimates Committee hearing-that this series is a very important one. It has been very well run. At the two lectures which I went to the speakers were Sir Zelman Cowan and Professor McMinn. In my view, the papers were extremely important ones and I am very proud, as a senator, to be in some way effectively associated with that lecture series. </PARA>
<PARA> The exhibition which was also referred to and which was questioned is the one which is currently in the public area of this Parliament House. Unfortunately, I missed the opening of that exhibition. However, I have had a chance to go over it quite carefully with two members of the Department of the Senate, Anne Millar and Rosemary Laing. I believe that is also an extremely important activity by the Department of the Senate and, again, I am proud to be associated with it. I am pleased to have the opportunity to give my congratulations to the Clerks and to all of those people who were associated with those exhibitions. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which was raised by Senator Coates related to the articles which have been published in a variety of journals and given at a number of sem- inars by the Clerk of the Senate and the Assistant Clerks. I have to say that, in some way, I am quite indebted to Senator Coates and Senator Schacht for drawing my attention to these articles. I have taken some time to gather what I believe to be a very large collection of this material and I have carefully read the articles, which I have in hand, so that I could make some careful assessment of the comments which have been raised by the honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that the articles, generally, offer, I believe, great insights into the workings of this chamber and this Parliament. I believe some of the articles are quite brilliant. I particularly draw honourable senators' attention to an article entitled Parliament and Constitutional Design which was delivered by the Clerk of the Senate in February last year at a seminar at the Australian National University. I thought that was a particularly brilliant article and one which gave great insights into the way that this Parliament and this chamber work. Again, I think this type of work is important. I am pleased that the Clerks are taking the time to write these articles because I believe they make an important and effective contribution and enable the wider community to have a chance to understand the workings of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I was quite interested in one of the articles about which Senator Coates was particularly aggrieved. This was the article entitled Finally Bringing the Troops Home. This was a superb case study of the work of a former, and I am pleased to say a future, senator in bringing forward a private member's Bill to establish the end of the war list. </PARA>
<PARA> I am interested that Senator Coates was upset by this article because if anyone in this chamber should be upset by this article, I am that person. I will quote from the article which got Senator Coates so upset. Amongst other things, Peter O'Keeffe comments on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Senator McGauran's political future being sabotaged by an agreement between the Victorian Liberal and National Parties which resulted in his preselection for the essentially unwinnable third place on the Coalition Parties' 1990 half-Senate election ticket. </PARA>
<PARA>I am of course in this chamber because I was on the unwinnable--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister will have his chance. Every time I mention preselections in Victoria the Minister gets very excited. I do not know why that is. Maybe he is a bit nervous, but I am not nervous, and I am trying to deal with an issue that is before the Committee at the moment-so I hope he will just bear with me. I happen to be the person who won that unwinnable third spot on the ticket, and I am pleased to say that my future colleague, Senator McGauran, will be at the number two spot for the next Senate half election and that he will be back in this chamber. So, one would have to say that there was a slight error of fact in the article. However, I think it was a very important article. I would have to say to Senator Coates that it was not used in any election context. I noticed that the issue was raised in the Senate Estimates Committee. I have read it carefully and I think it is most unlikely that Senator McGauran would ever use that particular article in any election context whatever. To conclude comments on that matter, if any senator in this chamber could be slightly offended by that article it would probably be me-but I certainly am not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to a matter that concerns the wider issue of the role of the Clerks in this chamber. I want to make a few brief comments on this. I can think of no other office in our Westminster system that is like the office of the Clerks, in the sense that they have to advise both sides of the Parliament. It is a very difficult and a very delicate role, and it is true that, in the past, it has been the Presiding Officer and Clerks who have been the great defenders of the institution of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in recent years a view has emerged in some chambers around this nation-and I stress that I do not make any reflection on the President of the Senate, because I believe he has the respect of all senators-that the office of Presiding Officer involves a party political role. I think that has been a most unfortunate development. Traditionally, the Presiding Officers and the Clerks have a very special role in our parliamentary system. It is a system that ensures that the chamber works well and is defended. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to Senator Coates and his colleagues that I have no objection to senators having strong views on various topics, and I have always felt that this chamber should provide the widest ambit through which matters can be raised and discussed. In this case, though, I would like to have seen a degree of sensitivity from Senator Coates about the manner in which he went about this particular activity and the way that he chose to raise it. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one would deny that the Presiding Officer, the President, in this chamber must be impartial in his rulings. The President would say that, as would all honourable senators in this chamber. Everyone agrees that the President must be impartial in his rulings in this place. I happen to disagree with the President about the emphasis he gives to Standing Orders on relevance and length of answers which, in my view, enables some Ministers to speak at excessive length. I have put my view. Clearly, the President thinks I am wrong, and I think he is wrong. I note that this decision by the President has far greater political consequences than any article by any Clerk. However, I have spoken in this chamber about my concerns. I have avoided extreme language and personal reflections, and have left the matter at that. People of good will can differ about their respective roles without getting into slanging matches. I have not accused the President of being partisan in relation to any notice of motion-and I would not do so because I do not believe that that is the case. I have not sought to join Estimates Committee A so that I can involve myself in haranguing the President. </PARA>
<PARA> This goes to the nub of my concern about Senator Coates. Senator Coates is entitled to his views, although, from my point of view, I would hope that they were more soundly based in evidence. But what we can ask and should ask of Senator Coates is that he follow more appropriate procedures and exercise a degree of sensitivity in pursuing his concerns. He may believe that the Clerks are wrong, misguided or lacking in judgment, but he has gone a major step further and accused them of being partisan, and he has raised issues concerning pro-active advice given by the Clerks, which-I do not have time to go into this at length-on close examination, would show the nonsense of the matters that he raised in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue could have been handled in a better and more effective way. I say that because, first, it relates to the respect that this chamber should have for the high office of Clerk and the recognition that the chamber should have of the restraints on the Clerk and his colleagues in responding to notices of motion. Secondly, when accusations of the type that are raised by Senator Coates are brought forward, it raises justifiable fears and opens the door to possible misunderstandings about the motives of the honourable senators involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the sensitivities involved, Senator Coates could, I believe, have raised his concerns initially with the Clerk. It is a great pity that he did not extend that courtesy. Failing that, I would have thought that Senator Coates should have taken up the invitation of the Clerk to discuss his concerns. Did Senator Coates ever reply to the letter that he received from the Clerk in relation to his notice of motion? Was this courtesy ignored as well?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates said to the chamber on Tuesday night that he did not explain his complaints with the Clerk because:</PARA>
<PARA>I believed it was quite inappropriate for me to enter into political debate with the Clerk or other officers of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The advantage of Senator Coates meeting with the Clerk is that it may have helped to resolve the matter or, failing that, have given the Clerk an opportunity to at least reply. That would have been a courtesy to a man who has served this chamber and senators of every political complexion. Regrettably, Senator Coates has chosen a forum-this chamber-to attack Clerks where they have no opportunity to reply. Senator Schacht, in his contribution last night, recognised that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the matters raised in Senator Coates's speech on the second reading debate have been well covered by my colleagues. There were just a few matters on which I would like to comment. Senator Coates said that it is he and the Government who are being attacked right now. He said that it was not the Clerks' duty to undermine, to continually attack and to oppose the Government. Senator Coates did not produce any substantive evidence for such a serious charge. He referred to three or four articles which, we should note, have very restricted circulation. It is Senator Coates who is doing the attacking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clerks are attacked for being so proud of the Senate and all they believe it stands for-who so revere it that they have allowed themselves to overstep the mark in defending it and promoting it. What a dreadful thing it is that people have loyalty to an institution that employs them. Who else should they be loyal to? Why should they not defend and promote the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates slides from defending and promoting the Senate to the next charge-that of manipulating the Senate. Where is the evidence for that serious charge? A few articles given to limited forums? Come on, Senator; you cannot be serious. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken earlier about the role of the President. As this matter seems to have got out of hand, I wonder whether the President cannot take a role in bringing about a resolution of the matter. Senator Coates has had his day. He ignored every common courtesy that should have occurred when he entered the chamber to deliver his attack on the Clerks. I think the President may well speak to his colleague Senator Coates and inform him of what the appropriate courtesies are and what evidence is required before extreme attacks are launched on individuals in the language that he has chosen. I hope that this sorry matter will be ended once and for all. </PARA>

The point about that timing is-there has got to be a two-way street-the behaviour of this chamber in Question Time, whilst not at the level of the House of Representatives, is drifting that way in terms of interjection and constant bellowing. In the end, that just denigrates us all in the eyes of the public. I do not distinguish between governments and oppositions or anything else. That is the first point I wanted to make. </PARA>

I thought that Senator Bishop's points last year in relation to that point were absolutely moronic. It indicated no bias whatsoever. As to the role of the Clerks, the bottom line is one for this chamber to determine and for the President to determine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extent to which Clerks should give newspaper interviews was especially highlighted in 1985 when the then Clerk gave a legal opinion on Lionel Murphy which appeared on the front page of the Age. I think all of us in this chamber would say that, at that extreme, that is wrong. On the other hand, writing for learned journals that no-one reads on the thrill ship and psychic thrill of being a Clerk in the chamber, as I think Mr O'Keeffe wrote, is at the other end that I do not take seriously. He has put his views; even if I find them offensive, I do not care. That is part of the debate; it is part of the political process. The article was written for a learned journal in a specialist area. </PARA>
<PARA> The only question is-I think even Senator Coates would agree-we would probably differ on where we draw the line. I draw the line somewhere down the middle, which would not surprise any of the four people sitting on this side of the chamber, knowing what a pragmatist I am. It is pretty much down the middle; I would regard the sorts of articles that appear in the Parliamentarian and all the rest as grist to the mill. It is possibly a pity that sometimes there is not a counter article put in so that we can have an intellectual debate over some of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> As to articles appearing in the Canberra Times giving opinions on this and that, one of the articles accused people in this chamber of being rubber stamps, being ruthless in trying to get government legislation through; if an identikit picture of me was put in with the article, I would wear it, because it is true. But it should be identified that it is me, otherwise it may leave a view that it is everyone. That is part of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that should be thought about is what the role of the Clerks is in the public arena. I think some sorts of guidelines should be put down as to what that role is. They should not be too restrictive; on the other hand, being involved with the daily newspapers and giving interviews on certain matters could at some stage come to rebound on Clerks, as it does on all of us because we get misquoted and stories are distorted. We have all been through that. We can come into this chamber when that happens and have the record corrected. Our colleagues who assist us here have no such rights other than through writing letters to editors that they find published on the back page a month later and their views are never properly represented. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that in my experience in this chamber I have seen a variety of public expressions from the Clerks in learned journals through to the front page of the Age. I was infuriated about what was on the front page of the Age in 1985-absolutely infuriated. I am in no way particularly offended by what is in some Clerks' magazine in England with a circulation of 180 or something. Who really cares? People can put in a response to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Kemp has come up with a very sensible suggestion when he says that the President might be able to have a look at this matter. I just take it a step further: the President may be able to issue-having washed it through the chamber, so to speak, in an informal way-some guidelines as to what sort of public role the Clerks could have in expressing their views and where to draw the line. That may avoid some of the more abrasive sort of debate that was complained of today and may bring about a situation where, by knowing all the rules in advance, no-one can take offence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to some of the comments that were made by Senator Ray. I was pleased to hear from the Minister for Defence ( Senator Robert Ray), who is at the table, that he did not have any particular problems with the articles which were written. That is my view too. He referred to an incident in 1985. I am not aware of that particular incident, but I would be happy to have a look at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In perhaps one or two matters the Minister carefully skirted around some of what I thought were the more substantive issues I raised, which was a bit of a pity. What I was talking about was not in any way restricting the right of honourable senators to come into this chamber and raise particular issues. At the end of the day, I would argue for the widest possible ambit for honourable senators to raise issues in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying that there are procedures which I think are better to follow, particularly in relation to the Clerks and the officers involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht will have his turn in a moment. If I have a concern about what the President is doing, I would either express it in a moderate way in this chamber or I would go and see him privately and express it in a more forceful manner. Then I would say that if the matter could not be resolved, and if I felt that there was a fundamental issue of principle involved, I would come into this chamber and raise it. But I think that courtesies and respect for officers have to be extended. It was a great pity that in Senator Ray's comments he carefully avoided discussing the behaviour of Senator Coates and the extremity of his language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not that Senator Coates said that the Clerks were wrong, unbalanced and lacking in sensitivity. Senator Coates went a major step further and said that the Clerks were being partisan. On the basis of these articles, on the basis of the views that Senator Ray has just given to this chamber, to my mind he does not agree with Senator Coates. But I should have thought that, if one of Senator Robert Ray's colleagues made a virulent accusation against officers and people who serve this chamber so well, he may have made some comment about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I wish to raise and to clarify, which Senator Ray tried rather cleverly to skirt over, is that the Clerks and their officers report to this chamber. That is their reporting relationship. I would like to see a meeting between the President and Senator Coates to determine whether there is not a better way to deal with this issue, not a meeting to lay down tight guidelines on what the Clerks should or should not do. What I have argued in this chamber is that there is a better way to deal with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Presiding Officer, the President, is a man who has great respect on both sides of the chamber and who in the end is the defender of this chamber. His role as President takes considerable precedence over any party political role. He may not be able to resolve this matter but I should like to see him take a particular role and determine whether the matters in relation to Senator Coates and Senator Schacht cannot be handled in a better way. I will leave my comments there but I would not want my original comments to have been misrepresented or reinterpreted by the Minister in the way that he did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the report of Estimates Committee A. I wish to refer to a number of things that occurred as a result of the report and the reservation. Estimates Committee A, once again, was the Committee that took the longest time to complete its hearings, twice the time taken in Estimates B or any other committee, and I draw that to the attention of honourable senators, as I have previously. Estimates A took 25 hours 49 minutes; Estimates B, 12 hours 30 minutes; Estimates C, 11 hours 18 minutes; Estimates D, 8 hours 40 minutes; Estimates E, 12 hours 47 minutes; and Estimates F, 8 hours 44 minutes. That shows a continued pattern. It also indicates that we had limited time at the end of those public hearings for our deliberations, but that was still done in an efficient way. I am concerned with the way in which the reservations that Senator Bishop proposed have been dealt with. That is why I draw attention to the fact that, while limited in the time we had, every opportunity was given for all honourable senators to express reservations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with your ruling, Mr Chairman, regarding the proposal by Senator Crichton-Browne. But my concern is the way that Senator Bishop and her colleagues have raised matters in their reservation that were not brought before the Committee itself. If this is to continue we will end up, on a day such as this when people are talking about the procedures of the Senate, in a situation where we will seriously challenge the traditions of the way Estimates committees are held. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go into that in any detail I should like to refer to the matters that are being discussed. The very point in the reservation that Senator Bishop and her colleagues have made is to deplore the activities of two Government senators. The point that I find objectionable is not the issue in this case but the fact that on a sensitive matter various senators put forward various points of view and we reached a concluded wording in the report about that matter. We tried to deal with it in a sensitive manner. It is fairly offensive then for a gratuitous attack to be made by Senator Bishop and her colleagues on at least one of the senators who was actively involved in trying to get agreed wording on the Committee. That in itself means that it will be harder next time when people are working in the way that we always have in the Senate to reach an agreed position and so benefit the institution itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I must comment on the other debate that is taking place. On the issue of the role of the Clerks, Senator Kemp has called for a degree of sensitivity. I support what Senator Ray said because there is a need for a degree of sensitivity. I think sensitivity has been lacking in the current discussion-I do not want to go into all the detail-in those references that I see as disparaging to my Party, with its 100 years of tradition. In other words, there was a lack of sensitivity in some of the articles towards at least a significant part of the Senate chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, out of this whole exercise we will have more sensitivity. I can certainly understand why people have objected. What has been written has been seen as lacking sensitivity towards a significant and traditional view that comes from one side of the chamber. That is implicit in this debate and it should be acknowledged. Everybody would be more satisfied if the positive suggestion by Senator Ray were taken up-that the President use his good offices to determine whether the role of the Clerks could be codified a little more. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, Senator Kemp, having raised the issue of the President using his good offices, wants only to discipline, if you like, people with whom he disagrees in the chamber. He has clearly put the onus back onto the person who raised this matter, Senator Coates. Senator Coates has done us a service because he has brought to a head something that, if it were to smoulder, would be against the interests of everybody. One way that might resolve the problem is for the President to try to introduce sensitivity on all sides. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matters I wish to deal with concerning Estimates Committees A are in the area of what I would describe as an unprecedented move by Senator Bishop and the Opposition to bypass the Committee itself, not raising an issue with the Committee and introducing it in a reservation. Firstly, I take issue with the reference in the Opposition's reservation to the Governor-General. If Senator Bishop had brought the matter of the Governor-General before the Committee we might have been able to modify her view. </PARA>
<PARA> Bypassing the Estimates Committee and the discussion that takes place in any Estimates committee has resulted in pure political propaganda going into the reservation without those involved having to go through the hurdle of the argument in the Estimates committee hearings. In this case, Senator Bishop has attacked a three-week trip by the Governor-General. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect might be the same, but I am sure that Senator Bishop does not realise that she is denigrating the Office of Governor-General in her biased attack on the Governor-General. In this reservation she and the Opposition have said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While not disputing the Governor-General's right to visit the Queen, we believe that this is an excessive cost for the taxpayer to bear . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, had Senator Bishop raised that matter at the Estimates Committee, we would have referred her to page A168 of the transcript where, when the question was asked of the officers of the Governor-General's staff, they pointed out that the length of the journey itself had been kept short. To the question of what had happened previously, we had a specific rebuttal of the attack on the Governor-General in that Mr Sturkey said:</PARA>
<PARA>An overseas visit in 1985 by the then Governor-General was 61 days in length. </PARA>
<PARA>He gave the length and the cost, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987, the then Governor-General was away 46 days. The cost was $107,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The specific answers given by the officers show that the current Governor-General's mid term visit is far shorter-as we were told, just over three weeks-and was deliberately kept short. Yet we have a clearly implied criticism. In this reservation we then have Opposition senators requesting:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the office of the Governor-General to provide a full breakdown of the cost of the trip along with the schedule of the official engagements undertaken on the trip.</PARA>
<PARA>That implies that something is not forthcoming. Mr Sturkey clearly said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are accountable for the official costs, naturally. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the clear answer to the question was that those figures would be supplied. Of course, if I were participating in the Estimates Committee, I would have been able to draw that to Senator Bishop's attention and we would not have had the clear bias, the clear attack, regarding the Governor-General that is implicit in the report that has been put forward by Senator Bishop and other Opposition senators. The whole of the reservation is based on matters that have not been brought forward to the Committee itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In the consideration of the Australian Customs Service, we have a significant part of the report-the Midford Paramount case-not being brought forward to the Committee. Therefore, there is no debate of the Committee on it. That is referred to in paragraph (d) of the report relating to the Customs Service. The disclosure of confidential information was not brought forward to the Committee, yet it is included in the reservation by Senator Bishop and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The tendering procedures referred to in paragraph (f) of the report were not brought before the Committee. There is no committee input on the biased attack on the Customs Service reflected in all of these reservations. Indeed, paragraph (g) of the reservations, which once again was not brought before the Committee, shows the bias of Senator Bishop. The comments are expressed without any testing and allowed her to continue the attack on the officers in the Customs Service on matters that she has been pursuing for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> These comments did not stop in the final section of the reservation, which relates to the Department of the Treasury. Once again, allegations are made but were not brought before this Estimates Committee because Senator Bishop again had a matter in her mind, and her colleagues acquiesced in her action in putting forward this report. It means that the Committee is being made a mockery of because we can sit for endless hours to hear evidence and we can sit down and genuinely try to reach agreement on the issues that we have agreed are issues that might go in the report. But that will not stop Senator Bishop leaving aside her pet list of issues so that she can bring them into the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> If this continues there is only one alternative, and it is a simple process. There will be a Government report and an Opposition report. Why waste the time of honourable senators in trying to get agreement when we know that there will be an additional list, almost as long as the report in many cases, where those matters have not been dealt with at the Committee. I believe that Government senators would be fools to allow this free kick, if you like, to take place every time there is a Senate Estimates committee meeting. It simply means that we are moving into a situation which, in my view, threatens the whole system of Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak with the experience that I have gained from being on endless numbers of committees where time and time again, in good faith, we have haggled for hours and hours about each sentence and each paragraph of a report. We have been able to do that successfully in all sorts of committees that I have been on. It seems that it is only in this area of Estimates Committee A that we have had this partisan development of the bypassing of the Committee. I inform those who are concerned about the forms of the Senate that these issues are much more challenging than some of the issues that we have spent time debating up until now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, your statement that you would not entertain debate on what Senator Childs has just had to say, I find very difficult. It think it is important to have on the record the way in which committee reports are formulated, what the meaning of a reservation is, and the practice and the way in which they used to be prepared. I would like to have those aspects on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are very specific issues that I want to raise with regard to the Department of the Senate, particularly the question of security. There are some remarks that I want to make with regard to those things which Senator Childs has just dealt with. I was aware that he was going to raise them because we discussed them over dinner one evening. Indeed, I want to place on the record the way in which these things come about. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I shall just go through the history of how reports of Estimates committees used to be prepared. When I first came on to a committee, I went along to a meeting at the end of a hearing; the report was first provided in draft form; we looked at it and the Government, which always had the numbers to pass the report, virtually said, `We came, we sat, we went'. It was a meaningless thing. It said nothing. It reflected none of the debate or the questioning that had gone on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the next meeting I inquired how we would effectively show the debate and the questioning that was dealt with. I was told that the mechanism to do that was by a reservation. The next time I went along to discuss a report-I got the usual meeting: we came, we sat, we went-the Opposition senators on the committee wrote a reservation which was included in the published document. A reservation is just that. </PARA>
<PARA> Here is a report passed by the Committee. It includes matters wished to be reserved by members who do not have the numbers. Quite frankly, the Government would not and could not agree with the matter dealt with in the reservation to this report. We had I think three-quarters of an hour to discuss the draft of the basis of the report prepared by the Secretary of the Committee in consultation with the Chairman. Therefore, that reflects those matters which the Chairman wishes to include in the report. When we came to deal with it, we settled some of the language in the report. That matter took some three-quarters of an hour. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of that, I think two items which were not previously mentioned in the report were included because Opposition senators wished to speak to them and, under the Standing Orders, they needed to be included in the report. Had the Chairman decided that they would not go in, they would have gone in the reservation. At one stage we had reports that were in the `we came, we sat, we went' category. We had reservations of substance, which made the Government look foolish. </PARA>
<PARA> The next time we came along to discuss the report there was serious discussion on matters of substance that would be included. On this occasion honourable senators on this side were most keen to find words in the report that the Government had the numbers to pass. Indeed, we did not vote against that report, as we had done on previous occasions; we voted in favour of the report and then added the reservations because we wished to raise these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear, as honourable senators have heard from the debate, that Opposition members have strong feelings of anger, insult and impropriety about the statements made regarding Senate officers. To expect that that not be reflected in the report--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite right. Senator Faulkner ought to be campaigning in the seat of Sydney. I return to the question of the report. That is how we arrive at a report with a reservation. Senator Childs said that he has sat on many committees for countless hours, as indeed I have, to find a report with which all people who participated in hearings regarding particular matters can agree. They go forward with a common purpose to see something achieved. Reports are usually full of recommendations. The nature of these reports is to reflect the information elicited during the process of the hearings; to bring it together so that it may be debated in this place in a coherent form. That is exactly what we are doing now-debating the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, you allowed Senator Childs leeway to deal with matters raised in the reservation of Opposition senators. You would prefer that I deal with the substance of what he dealt with when we come to those particular parts on those departments. I am pleased to follow that ruling, Mr Chairman. I place on notice the fact that I will be delighted to debate the question I raised under the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the point dealing with the Governor-General, which comes under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I spoke on a general Appropriation Bill. I made some remarks on the role and the function of the Senate Clerks and their officers. I am not a member of Senate Estimates Committee A, but I attended and asked questions because of my concerns on a number of matters. I did so because that was the most appropriate forum in which to raise issues. It gave the Clerk of the Senate and his officers an opportunity to respond directly to any of my queries. I thought that was the most open way to do it. It is much more preferable than doing it in any other forum where the Clerk and his officers would not be able to respond on the public record. If people read the transcript of the Senate Estimates Committee A which was held in April they will see that the Clerk of the Senate and his officers responded very fully. They raised their views in response to questions. That is excellent. That is what the process is about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp suggested that Senator Coates and I should have gone and spoken to the Clerk and made our views and concerns known at that time. That is certainly a valid point. But I suspect that, if we had, the Opposition would have said that we had gone there privately to intimidate the Clerk. One gets caught both ways in these sorts of arguments. I thought that the most appropriate way was to start at the Estimates Committee, where the Clerk could respond to any questions that I or other senators asked on these matters. That is the most open and the fairest way under our system. I also note that in the reservation in the report Senator Bishop, Senator O'Chee and Senator Short say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We deplore the attack made by two Government Senators-</PARA>
<PARA>I presume Senator Coates and me; we are the ones in the gun-</PARA>
<PARA>during the hearings on the integrity of officers of the Senate and uphold the propriety of officers of the Senate in making a contribution in a nonpartisan way to discussions concerning the procedural operations of the parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, if people read the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee A they will see that we were asking questions and getting responses. It was a very healthy debate. Surely, no Opposition member is afraid of debate in which people have the opportunity to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite say that we were attacking the integrity of the officers of the Senate. We were not doing that; we were raising the question about the content of some of the public comments the Senate Clerk and his officers had made. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Robert Ray. I said the same last night. Quite frankly, I do not give too much weight to these arguments. It does not worry me too much whether the Senate Clerk or anybody else in the Senate or anywhere else in the community disagrees with my views about the functioning of the Senate. That is part of the public debate. My point is that when they are made, even in obtuse learned journals, no-one should be surprised when occasionally some of us choose to respond and say, `We disagree with that view' or `We want more information of why the Senate Clerk and his officers hold that view'. That is part of the public debate. No-one should be upset about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw the attention of the Committee to an article written by the Clerk entitled `Unbogging the Parliamentary Reform Wagon' that appeared in a magazine called Legislative Studies at Volume 5 No. 2 Summer 1991. The document is part of the public debate, but a number of views have been expressed in it by the Clerk with which, I suspect, even Opposition senators may disagree. The Clerk makes an assertion in this article about the beginning of operation of the referral of Bills to Senate standing committees. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The operation of this new system was delayed by the 1990 general election until August 1990, and immediately ran into troubles, indicated by disputation in the Senate as to how the system should work. There were a number of causes of the problem. The government, having agreed to the changes just before an election the outcome of which was uncertain, appeared to be trying to reverse them and to claw its way back to the old system, which is seen, probably mistakenly, as being marginally more congenial to government control of legislation, or at least to government minimisation of parliamentary interference with legislation. Government party members still instinctively regard parliamentary scrutiny as a hostile tactic of oppositions. It seldom occurs to them that it is what they should be doing.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of value judgments are expressed. The Clerk expresses a view that the Government backed off on this because we were worried about the election outcome. As a senator from South Australia, I have to say that the operation of the parliamentary Senate system or the committee system was not a really top issue in South Australia. I did not get any constituents knocking on my door or going berserk and saying, `You terrible people do not have a decent Senate system or committee system in the Senate and therefore we are going to change our vote accordingly'. Those of us who meet the electors regularly, particularly in the last election campaign, know that many other issues had a much higher priority. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not disagree that the Clerk has the right to that view, but it is a view that has some controversy; it concerns the Government's attitude to the introduction of the new system. Why should we not have a right to respond, either in the Estimates committees or here in this chamber, or defend our view that we believe he is wrong in expressing his view about the Government? It is not a cause that I will die in the ditch for, but if a senator wants to respond, he or she should be able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In this same article there are comments as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian public, or those of the minority who have dealings with members of parliament, have to be educated out of the idea that members are overpaid social workers, personal counsellors and departmental liaison officers. In this regard, Senators have always been in a better position than members of the House of Representatives, but there is a disturbing tendency to involve Senators in ` `consistency work''-</PARA>
<PARA>I think that should read `constituency work'-</PARA>
<PARA>most of which is a waste of time and resources.</PARA>
<PARA>If we go out and tell members of the Australian public that we are wasting our time listening to what they are saying, they will take action on us all right: we will not get re-elected. If the Clerk wants to have that view, that is fine, but I have the right to say to any member of the public who did happen to read this article that I do not agree with it. I believe that constituents have the right to tell me what they want done, even if I or someone else may think it irrelevant. Democracy is responding to the people who elect us. </PARA>
<PARA> When we go on, we find comments in this article about how to improve the calibre of members of parliament. Everybody in Australia has a view about improving members of parliament. The Clerk is quite right to raise the issue if he wants to, but there may be members in this place who would say that some of these views would be refuted by some senators opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, there is a suggestion in this article that there should be a minimum age limit for a member of parliament. Senator O'Chee, who is still in his twenties and is the youngest senator, and who made a reservation in support of our right of attack on the so-called integrity of the Senate Clerk, may be a bit bemused that the Clerk has suggested that there ought to be a minimum age because people of an older age are more mature in handling their responsibilities. If the Clerk wants to hold that view, that is fine, but he should expect that some senators who are of a young age-and at 44, I am not in that category any more; even the Clerk may say that mine is a reasonable age to be in the Parliament-may disagree. Senator O'Chee is clearly the youngest member of the Senate. He may disagree and say, `I am a fully mature person who is able to debate issues and put my view'. A lot of electors aged 18 might say that they would like to vote for younger members if they had the chance. </PARA>
<PARA> The same article also says:</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly the selection processes-</PARA>
<PARA>of parliamentary candidates-</PARA>
<PARA>whereby candidates are chosen need to be reformed. A critical examination (where are our investigative journalists?) of the candidate-selection processes is long overdue. Such examination would inevitably give rise to a campaign for the introduction of primary elections, a reform which is often suggested for countries with parliamentary systems.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very strong view. It may be valid, but I would suspect that, in Australia, some people in this Parliament would strongly disagree with imposing a primary system of preselection. One should ask a lot of American congressmen what they think of the primary selection process. It means that a person has to be a millionaire to meet the cost of that primary election if he is to have any chance of getting selection to run for parliament. So we may well change the nature of members of parliament, but it will only be on the basis of how much money they have to run the primary election campaign. It is a matter of interest and controversy which should be debated. If the Clerk or other members of the Department of the Senate wish to debate it, that is fine, but they and Opposition senators should expect that occasionally some of us may choose this forum or an Estimates committee to say that we disagree with that view because it is part of the public debate. These are not matters dealing narrowly with even the function of the Department of the Senate; they deal with the whole nature of Australian government and the democratic system. In that case let us have a debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The President has indicated that he has spoken to me and that I have agreed to have an informal discussion with the Clerk on some of these matters. I am happy to do so at any time under the chairmanship of the President. In that forum I am sure that we will go through some of these and other issues. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter which really has to be debated is the function of the Department of the Senate. We want a Senate department that clearly is efficiently and effectively operating and, as Senator Robert Ray says, is like the umpire-it is doing a good job when no-one thinks about it. That is what we want the Department of the Senate to be about. </PARA>
<PARA> Since my remarks last night when I talked briefly about industrial democracy and the morale in the Department of the Senate, a number of employees of the Department have spoken to me; there were not many, but a number. They said, `You have raised the real issue. There is a problem of morale in the Department of the Senate'. It ought to be the first function of the Clerk and Assistant Clerks of the Department of the Senate to deal with questions such as the morale of the staff. If there are such concerns about the morale of the staff of the Senate, it is an issue that should, in a management sense, be the first priority to be dealt with. We cannot have a Senate department where morale is affected. Clearly, the gossip and backbiting about the resignation of the Secretary of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has led to a lot more comment about the functioning and the operation of the Department of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, I welcome the commitment given in a document produced at the Estimates about the introduction of industrial democracy. I believe that that is the way in which the energies of the Senate officers should be directed so that we can get the Department of the Senate operating; so that some of the possibly misguided feelings of staff members who are unhappy with the way the place is functioning can be overcome; and so that Senate personnel can feel that they have the confidence to openly express their disagreement with management. At the moment I suspect that they are not that confident that they can do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that the real issue in the debate that I want to deal with is the functioning of the Department of the Senate. I would be quite happy to debate, with the Clerk or anyone else, the issues of the functioning and role of the Senate in democracy. However, the day-to-day issue-the bread and butter issue-is having an efficient Senate department running, one with good morale, one which no-one has any doubt about, where there is no controversy and no argument and one that goes on unseen. I welcome the introduction of industrial democracy into the Department of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that Senator Coates said on 14 May:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That raises a significant point: does it not make the Clerk, and the Opposition for that matter, stop and think, when all the support and defence comes from one side of the chamber?</PARA>
<PARA>Unless I thoroughly misunderstood the President of the Senate, he demolished Senator Coates's observation by his own public statements. Unless I am thoroughly wrong, that is a thoroughly untrue assertion. The vast majority of this chamber-all four parties, plus the independent-do support the Clerks, their work and their conduct. In my view, this attack by Senator Coates is perhaps one of the most squalid and bigoted attacks that I have seen. It reeks with prejudice and old hatreds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret that there are those on the Labor Party side who believe that the Government of 1975 was sacked as a result of some deep, dark conspiracy between the Clerks and the Opposition. That bigotry, bitterness and hate, that conspiracy theory, oozes from them from time to time and manifests itself in the way that we have seen in Senator Coates. I do not mind there being great haters on the Labor Party side any more than I mind there being great haters on our side of politics, but I do not believe that I have to be visited daily by those prejudices. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sympathetic to those who waited a whole generation to win government in 1972, only to see it snatched away from them three short years later as a result of the failings of that Government. I am sympathetic to those who sat in this Parliament for 16 and 17 years, waiting for government, only to see it evaporate before their eyes, but there is no reason why everybody else has to be visited by their bigotry, bitterness, and dissatisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why this chamber has to be subject to a failed member of the House of Representatives who uses this forum to express his own political views, who keeps his family at whatever standard suits him as a result of the income he gets from being a senator, and who then turns around and condemns, criticises and attacks the forum in which he participates. </PARA>

<PARA> I was interested to hear Senator Ray say that he was outraged by a front page article in the Age by the Clerk giving a legal opinion on the Lionel Murphy case.

I understand that, but my sympathy does not make it right. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that Senator Schacht and Senator Coates have left us. If we need any example of this agenda, of this sort of attitude, we may look at Senator Schacht's referral to the matter of Miss Leanne Craze and the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority (NCA). Recently, we had a meeting of the NCA Committee at which the Clerk was invited to address certain matters. After that meeting the Clerk left the meeting room, and some short time later I followed him. As we walked down the corridor-I was some 100 yards behind him-I passed Senator Schacht, chatting idly, presumably, to Senator Walsh. He made a comment like this: `I wonder what sort of conspiracy is being cooked up now, with the Clerk going past us first and now Crichton-Browne'-words roughly to that effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite assert their support for independence but what they are asserting is the Senate officers' right to make political statements, to enter into the thick of debate about highly political issues. It just happens that on many of those issues Opposition senators agree with the points of view being put forward and they suggest, therefore, that an independent position is being put. The problem is that the fact that the officers concerned claim to have, or ought to have, independence adds to the status of what they say, in that it is not just regarded as a statement by a politician which can be judged on the basis of that politician's own political interests. That is why this entering into the political process is something which ought to be avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right; Senator Walters knows better about people on this side of the chamber than I do! Be that as it may; I am just letting her know that people do take offence at some of the things that have been said. One of the things that I want to do-Senator Walters has reminded me of it-is to answer a couple of misrepresentations that she made in her comments yesterday. Referring to me, she used the words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . visited our committee in an attempt to thwart its smooth running. </PARA>
<PARA>I assume that she was referring to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs when I was temporarily put on that Committee to fill in for someone who was away for a couple of days. I was certainly not put on it to thwart its smooth running, and I cannot remember what she can be suggesting as to how I did any such thwarting anyway. I participated in a fairly mild sort of way, but with no such thwarting. She certainly misunderstands the reasons for my being on that Committee. I was merely filling in for someone who was away. The other matter I want briefly to refer to rather than go into the whole history of it is that Senator Walters asserted that I had:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . refused to allow the Opposition to elect a deputy chairman to that Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration-</PARA>
<PARA>until, in the last couple of weeks, he was finally forced to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>I was not forced to do anything. I agreed to appoint a deputy chair on the basis of an assurance that I had received about the Opposition's attitude to an alteration of Standing Orders. That has since been reversed and my attempt to change--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assurance was passed to me, as Senator Kemp knows, by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) on the understanding of what he had been told by Senator Hill. I have not made any further fuss about that matter since. I sought to change the Standing Orders. The alternative was put up that it ought be referred to the Procedure Committee. I moved that referral and that is where the matter rests at the moment. I am merely trying, without developing the whole issue again, to answer Senator Walters's suggestion that I was forced to do so. Also just for the record, I feel the need to correct an assertion by Senator Harradine on what he said was a fairly minor matter. He asserted that I had interfered in a closed meeting of a committee of which I was not a member. Yes, I was waiting outside in a different corridor from the one he was waiting in. That ought to close that particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to deal fairly briefly with one thing that arises in some of the articles of which I complained and which was referred to in the debate this morning. That is the question of the procedure for the referral of Bills to committees and the problem I have seen in the Clerks' articles making assertions about the attitudes of people to that procedure. I guess this illustrates one of the problems of entering into the public debate, especially when inaccuracies or, to put it in another way, incorrect observations, are made because of insufficient knowledge-perhaps I can be as generous as that-adding to the offence taken about what is written. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clerk's position seems to be that there was unanimous support for the referral of Bills to committee procedures at the end of 1989 and that at some later stage after the election Labor members started objecting to it. The record is that in December 1989 the Government at the time agreed, with a high degree of reluctance, to go along with a short experiment of this procedure. There was no suggestion at the time that we were wholehearted supporters of the procedure or anything like that. There was great reluctance but, in the spirit of compromise, we agreed to a short experiment. That is the situation. There was no great support for the procedure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. I remind the honourable senator that Senator Chaney thought he was going to be in government and he agreed with Senator Ray that it should be only a short experiment so that he-if it turned out that his side was to be in government-would not be stuck with it after the election. That is why the amendment was moved to make it a sessional order which was intended to expire at the end of that session. As it turned out, that session did not continue because the election was held before the Senate sat again in 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened is that the other leg of the motion, about it beginning on the first sitting day in 1990, took precedence over the procedure coming to a conclusion at the end of that session. Hence, we are having not just a short experiment, which was the understanding and agreement, but a much longer experiment which still has no sunset clause except the end of this session, which could be as far away as early 1993. I raise that point to illustrate the problem of involvement in public debate on matters of dispute. </PARA>

Secondly, when Senator Coates was speaking the word `coward' was used. I do not think it will appear in the Hansard because I do not think it was responded to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some follow-up remarks in order to respond to the comments made by Senator Coates and Senator Schacht. Firstly, Senator Schacht raised the issue of industrial democracy in the Department of the Senate. He complained that it had been in the corporate plan for three years and he asked why nothing had happened on that. I would like to pose a question which perhaps could be answered at some stage. Is it the case that the whole procedure of industrial democracy in the Department of the Senate has been held up because there is a dispute with the Public Sector Union? I understand that the Public Sector Union believes only those people who are members of unions can vote for this procedure, whereas I understand another view is that everyone in the Department of the Senate should be able to vote for it. If the answer to the question I have posed is that that hold-up has been caused because the view is that all members of the Department of the Senate, not just those who are members of the Public Sector Union, should vote, then I hope that this whole procedure is held up until everybody has his or her chance to vote.

<PARA> I did fully agree with one matter raised by Senator Coates and I would like to record that now. He said that he believed the office of the Clerk should be independent and neutral. I also believe that is the case; there is no question about it. Furthermore, I believe that is the view of all of the Clerks. What worries us on this side is that we have heard these accusations and extreme language used against the Clerk-and these attacks have been partisan-on such an incredibly trivial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, was at the table he mentioned to us that he had no worries about the articles. I think he thought that some of them were a bit robust, but he had no worries about them. Senator Schacht got up and said that he felt that because the views were put in the article and he had had a chance to debate them that was okay too. As I have said before, I would have preferred, because of the sensitivities of the position and because of the need to maintain the independence of the position, that there had been a better procedure. But I do not dispute any honourable senator's right, after having followed proper procedures, to come in here and raise particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me-I would like this to be recorded and I hope that the President of the Senate will take some note of it-is that we are seeing an attack on the independence of the office of the Clerk. If the Clerk cannot write academic articles or cannot put a view about the way this chamber operates without being subjected to attack-this is Senator Coates's intention; he did not want to see the Clerk or hear about his office, even on matters about which the Clerk may undoubtedly be able to make an important contribution to public debate-Senator Coates is politicising the office of the Clerk. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise another point made by Senator Coates. He is worried about proactive advice which the Clerk is giving to Opposition senators. I will read from what Senator Coates said during Estimates Committee A. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate that a section of the Senate Department should advise non-government senators. But how proactive is that objective supposed to be? Is there any guideline given to the staff of that office to indicate that they should respond to requests? Are they permitted to take some initiatives themselves in providing advice and drafting support for non-government senators?</PARA>
<PARA>When Senator Coates raised that issue-and he may feel that it is a fair issue-he caused a great deal of concern to this side of the House and, I am sure, to the Australian Democrats. What Senator Coates is doing is attacking the right of people on this side of the chamber to get advice from the Clerk's office. If Senator Coates has his way, no Clerk in this chamber will be able to give advice fearlessly to honourable senators who are not members of the government party because they will be subjected to the sort of harassment that he and, regretfully, Senator Schacht have conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clerk's office must be independent and neutral. But the great precedents in our constitutional history, stretching back to the Bill of Rights at the end of the seventeenth century, have involved matters of great controversy regarding presiding officers and Clerks. I think it is better that the Clerks and the presiding officers are not accused of being politically partisan. At the end of the day the President of the Senate and the Clerk of the Senate have to stand up and defend this chamber. I resist to the greatest extent anything which would inhibit the capacity of Opposition senators to get advice from the Clerical office. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to Senator Coates that if he takes the Senate down this road and if he makes these threats-and I point out that his Party does not have the numbers in this chamber-this chamber will resist strongly any threat to the independence of the office of the Clerk and any threat to the rights of Opposition senators to get fearless advice from those officers. </PARA>

The problem that the Speaker and I have, in the particular case that Senator Bishop referred to, is that the person who has been reinstated said that they were moving the property from one part of the building to another. Obviously, that is what the Merit Protection and Review Agency accepted, and it reinstated the person. That makes it very difficult for us to then turn around and say that they were stealing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Would it be inappropriate for the details of that matter to be provided to the Senate, so that we can at least get a feel for it? As I understand it, the person in question had finished their day's work-I think it was after midnight, in fact. Pot-plants were being placed into the boot of that person's motor vehicle-which had been taken from the car park to the front of the building-under the supervision and watchful eye of two other security people. There had been no authority, no direction, no instruction by anybody for the person in question to move the pot-plants anywhere. Presumably, the pot-plants would have been put in a room somewhere. It is all very mysterious. On the face of it, the proposition that they were simply moving pot-plants from one part of the building to another seems bizarre.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne is placing, shall we say, the colour of the incident on the record. There is a little more to it. It has been said to me, firstly, that one of the reasons charges were not laid is a reason that circulates in the rumour-mill of this building. Secondly, when it came to the question of the review, it was a question of having no reports of previous behaviour which would have rendered that person unsuitable. Again, an allegation has been made to me-I will not use it this time-as to why those reports did not exist. Those sorts of stories are worrying because they come from more than one source.</PARA></TALK.START>

Surely, she can be found something else to do that does not in any way place her in the area of being in charge of security. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to a question I raised in the Estimates Committee of security generally in this building through the application of mechanical devices. As I recall, we learnt that there are machines in place which, but for very modest alterations, could very effectively monitor the flow of bags and other goods-certainly one way and perhaps both ways. It would not be a difficult task to have the conveyor belts and monitor screens operating as pass-holders left the building. What is the status of that matter? Is there any intention to pursue that? I do not have the list with me, regrettably. If my memory serves me correctly, I was provided with a document in the Estimates Committee which showed some hundreds of thousands of dollars of theft of goods belonging to the taxpayers from this building. I would have thought that the yardstick for the putting in place of that equipment ought not to be the measure of the cost of that as weighed against the value of goods. As a matter of intrinsic principle, there ought to be some security system put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

Certainly, those points will be taken up. I would like to point out, however, that the amount of theft from the building has shown a dramatic decline in recent months-in fact, even in the last year. It is a much better record than it was when the building was first opened. I reiterate: we are carrying out a full review of the security of the building.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made the point in the Estimates that in many respects this building is unique because of its enormous size and because of the general access that all pass-holders have to all parts of the building, with exception perhaps-I say perhaps-of the ministerial wing. Anybody with a pass can gain access to almost any room or any office in this building without being apprehended or questioned. To that extent, it is very easy for people to move improperly and without authority into any part of the building for the purposes of stealing either money or equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I give the example of the Liberal party room which is locked outside normal working hours. Our video was stolen from that party room. To be able to go in there and physically pick up a piece of equipment of that size and walk out with it in the midst of a busy working day in a building of this size, with so many people moving around, and without being questioned gives some indication of the ease with which people can steal equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only assume that the video player has been taken home, not simply moved to another part of the building. That highlights the difficulty we have with security of the building. In a slightly more trivial matter recently, we had a party meeting and moments after it finished, somebody stole the biscuits, the milk and the sugar. </PARA>

If the doorways to the building were sensitised and such a piece of equipment were taken through them, the chip would trigger a signal in the same way as occurs if someone steals something from David Jones or Grace Bros. In those stores if someone steals something with a chip attached, whether it be a pair of socks or a piece of furniture, alarms go off as it goes through the door.

<PARA>That comes only a matter of some days after the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) spoke in similar terms in the other chamber. Talking about the Opposition's performance, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they have made this their policy . . . after nine months they would take them off the benefit completely. That is the Opposition's policy: to take them off the benefit and to throw them on the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA>After several points of order were taken, he simply repeated that proposition and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Even worse, as I have said, not only would those opposite reduce the real value of benefits, but after a period of nine months they would throw the unemployed entirely off the benefit . . . How dare they get up and pretend in this House that they have any real concern for the unemployed in this country? It is hypocritical grandstanding. </PARA>
<PARA>That is breathtaking hypocrisy of the highest order. It is, I think, clearly a deliberate attempt to frighten the pants off thousands of Australians who have been thrown on the employment scrap heap as a direct result of the Government's failed economic policies. I think the latest official figure for unemployment is 844,000. Those people are not simply accidental victims of a recession. They are helpless statistics of a callous and deliberate economic strategy of high interest rates and high unemployment, designed to knock high inflation, and anything else that moves, out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a government that in effect has deliberately embarked on a strategy which is now coming to fruition, and that is to drive inflation out of the system by raising the level of unemployment to intolerable levels. It is against that background that I find it absolutely extraordinary that in the space of less than a week we have two senior Ministers, one of whom is the Prime Minister, somehow pretending to the electorate that the Opposition has a policy of taking people off benefits after nine months when they know that to be false. </PARA>
<PARA> We should just look at the degree of sympathy that has been demonstrated in the past by the Government on this very question. We should bear in mind the Government's approach, which I think most commentators would accept has been a direct result of a response to the Opposition's proposals during the last election campaign. We made it clear then, and we maintain it now, that it is appropriate that there be a finite cut-off point for those in receipt of benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In this instance, we have taken the view, as we did then, that the unemployment benefit per se should cease after nine months. But-and it is a critical and crucial `but'-we would then expect those people to satisfy the Department of Social Security that they had made every reasonable endeavour to find and accept work. If they do satisfy the Department, they would then be eligible for special benefits. That is precisely the distortion and half-truth that I am so concerned about today. Both of those Ministers have deliberately omitted reference to the second half of the equation, which is absolutely vital. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just hark back to the last election campaign and look at some words of that great sympathiser with the poor, the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Speaking on the 7.30 Report on 22 February-in other words, during the heat of the election campaign-this is what he had to say in response to questions from Paul Lyneham:</PARA>
<PARA>But we're now down to those people who've been there for years. And we've got to go now and intensively interview them and say . . . look at them. Make them apply for work. If they don't apply for work we bump them off'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Treasurer for you. That is the dripping with compassion approach adopted by the Treasurer in terms of the unemployment benefit. His view, his preference, is to cut people off after a fixed period. Whether it is nine months or 12 months would be incidental to him. `If they don't apply for work, we bump them off'-that is what he has to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the edification of Senator Button, who obviously should be using a bionic ear himself before he offers to make it available to others, the Treasurer said, `If they don't apply for work, we bump them off'. Nothing could be clearer than that. Again, just to show that the Treasurer was very much aware of the second leg of our approach, this is what he had to say at a doorstop interview on the same day--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 22 February of last year in the heat of the election campaign. Senator Button was probably up north relaxing with a crook back, but everyone else was out on the hustings. The Treasurer was doing his best, of course, to demolish our policy on unemployment benefit. I will be very interested to see whether Senator Button can correct what the Treasurer had to say at the time because he was at pains to demonstrate that somehow the costings of our proposals were unreliable. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We have costed the Opposition's unemployment benefit proposal-</PARA>
<PARA>which he described as unreal-</PARA>
<PARA>and what they said was they could yield the $700 million savings from unemployment, we're yielding a $3 million saving. Remember that we're yielding $3 million, they said they could yield a saving of $700 million, that is by saying after 9 months you're out, and we've said that's unreal, if you're out, they'll just turn up for special benefit and so therefore the issue was that assumption, how many people would return for special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>So there it is, as clear as crystal. The Treasurer knew full well, and no doubt still does, that our proposal clearly involves the cessation of one benefit and eligibility for another after a finite period of time. That is the distortion that I complain about. I have not yet heard Senator Button, or Senator Richardson for that matter, perpetrate this falsehood. As a result of my comments today, I hope sincerely that we will not. But if this is the first shot in a dirty tricks election campaign for a poll some 12 or 18 months away-I could not imagine that the Government would want to go to the electorate prematurely this time around-it really does deserve a very solid response and the record must be set straight at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope we will hear no more at all of the suggestion that somehow the Opposition is about cutting people off after nine months with no further recourse. Our policy on this issue has always been that after that period of time they would, if necessary, be eligible for special benefits. So let us get it straight. We are interested in an active employment strategy. Our concern is not to punish victims, our concern is not to simply achieve restructuring which by hook or by crook reduces the numbers on benefits. Our approach is to ensure that there are adequate incentives in the system, that all attempts to find work are maximised and that every endeavour is made on the part of each and every applicant for benefits before they are considered for special benefits. I hope that that is clear and there will be no more of this nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that, Madam Acting Deputy President. I probably should have said, `the bungling and the impropriety with which Senator Bolkus was handling the matter of the Nashua contract'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I interjected, Senator Ray pointed at me and said:</PARA>
<PARA>I searched the public record to see whether I could find Senator Macdonald saying something about the tendering processes in Queensland. He has been absolutely silent. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say that the Liberal Party in Queensland never objected to those tendering processes. He was indicating that we should not accuse Senator Bolkus of impropriety because we had said nothing about the impropriety that was alleged to have occurred in Queensland. As one who lived through the difficulties in Queensland politics at the time when we went out of government, to me Senator Ray's allegation is particularly offensive, especially as we went out of government over something as basic as public accountability in the way the Queensland Government was run. At the time, Senator Ray challenged me not to provoke him further. I did try to provoke him further and told him he should go on and be provoked and come out with whatever he wanted to say about that. But at that point of time I was stopped and warned by the Deputy President, and so the exchange ceased. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon Senator Ray to be provoked and to go further if he wants to. He will find from my record, and from that of the Liberal Party in Queensland, that we have always been determined to see that the right thing was done in government in relation to contracts. We were very concerned about it in Queensland. We are equally concerned about it here when Senator Bolkus mismanages his portfolio and deals with contracts in what we consider to be a very improper way in this particular Government as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray may know a lot about how the Victorian economy is falling into disrepair; he may know how to fight factional fights in Victoria; he may know how to deal with gold and stamps in Western Australia; but he obviously knows nothing about political history in Queensland. I take particular offence at the remarks that he made on 8 May, as reported in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Ray that it was a New South Wales Labor politician who was the first serving politician to be gaoled, and that was for misappropriation and for dishonest conduct. There are legends in history about the bully-boy tactics of the New South Wales Labor Party and iron bars and hospitalisation and criminal charges. History books have been written about that. For Senator Ray to suggest that we, in the Liberal Party in Queensland, never raised our voices is, as I say, quite offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> The revelations in the Western Australian Royal Commission in no way surprised me. They are simply a repeat of the allegations that are being made against the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the union movement in the Cooke inquiry in Queensland. Mr Cooke, the Commissioner, recommended, before the beginning of this year, that a number of people be charged. He has recommended that criminal charges be laid against ALP and trade union officials. He has recommended that one of those who should be charged is the then vice-president of the Queensland ALP who allegedly misused union funds to buy himself a Gold Coast unit. And yet in spite of those recommendations by a commissioner, not one of those people has yet been charged. There is a growing feeling within Queensland that there is one set of laws for everyone else but a different set of laws for the ALP and its union mates in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, the office of the special prosecutor investigated more than 40 former government Ministers and charged five National Party Ministers within six months. Yet the same department, under this Labor Government, has dithered for more than eight months over charges against a dozen ALP officials and trade unionists. One might well ask: why do the wheels of justice move so slowly when it comes to the ALP?</PARA>
<PARA> I understand there have been allegations of misappropriation of large sums of union funds which have found their way into the personal accounts of trade union officials and ALP members. Therefore, it is no wonder that Mr Burke felt he was justified in mixing his own stamps with some more valuable stamps that belonged to the ALP. It has been alleged in the Cooke inquiry that union members' funds have been spent on prostitutes, and it is therefore no surprise to me that revelations are coming out of the Western Australian inquiry on how the ALP prostituted itself to obtain funds for its election campaigns. Five former National Party Ministers have been convicted of misappropriation of funds, but why are the trade union officials and the ALP members not being brought before the courts to answer the allegations of misappropriation made against them by the commission of inquiry in Queensland?</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government is trying its best to distance itself from every other Labor government in the country, in spite of Mr Goss's claim that he wanted to do for Queensland what John Cain had done for Victoria. We do not hear too much about that now. But Mr Goss's Government is trying to distance itself from the Federal Labor Government and from every other Labor government. It is trying to put on the lilywhite image of `We are so good; we do everything properly; we don't misuse public funds'. Yet we have the spectacle that came to light earlier this week of the former member for Nundah who, for political reasons, the fact that he could not handle and put up with the political dishonesty of the Goss Government, took off from Queensland and went to Port Macquarie. The expensive Joh jet that the ALP spent months-nay, years-criticising the former National Party Government for using, and which it guaranteed that it would sell and never again use for any purposes--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not a Liberal-National Party government, as the honourable senator well knows; he is perpetrating the lie that I find quite offensive that Senator Ray tried on me the other day. The honourable senator can do it as much as he likes; he will get the truth from me, not the sorts of mud-slinging allegations that he throws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I am diverted, probably deliberately, from the point I was making: the Joh jet, which the ALP in Queensland promised to sell-promised never to use improperly; in fact, promised never to use-was used to go down and get this Labor member of parliament back from New South Wales. It was used to bring him back to Queensland so that the ALP Government would not have to face a by-election in these tough times that the Labor Party has imposed upon the whole country. </PARA>
<PARA> Those in the Queensland ALP Government are scared stiff of the by-elections this weekend because, although they have done nothing themselves, they are worried about the muck that the Labor Party in Western Australia has been through and all the dishonesty over there, and they are worried about the mess into which the ALP has put this economy. They are petrified at what might happen this weekend in those by-elections. So they went down to get this fellow, one of their political mates, to come back and not resign, to rip up his resignation and sit back in the House so they would not have to face a by-election. </PARA>
<PARA> But did they send the Minister, Mr Mackenroth, down on a commercial aircraft? Did they charter their own aircraft? Did the Labor Party in Queensland use some of its $15m cash box to hire its own aircraft to go down and do that? No, it used the Joh jet, the jet that it used to criticise Joh and the Queensland Government for using in former times. But it found no difficulty whatsoever in using the Joh jet on its mercy dash to Port Macquarie to try to drag one of its members back so it would not have to suffer the indignity of a by-election in these times. </PARA>
<PARA> Those representatives of the Queensland Government said that they went down to get him and they tried to justify it by the fact that he was suicidal. They said he was ill and they were concerned about his health. But, if that is correct, I ask them to tell me how many doctors they took down on the plane on this mercy dash mission in the Joh jet. Of course, they took none. They took the Police Minister and his private secretary for what Mr Heath, the ex-member, said were purely political purposes. That is not me saying it; it is a member of the ALP saying it and a person who was a parliamentarian in the ALP Government in Queensland. So they have used the Joh jet at a cost of about $3,000 or $4,000 to Queensland taxpayers to get this fellow back for purely political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are former Government Ministers languishing in Queensland gaols for misuse of taxpayers' money of as little as $2,000, $3,000, and $4,000. One could well ask why Mr Mackenroth is not going in there to join them-because that is what he has done. He and his Party, for their own political purpose, have used that Joh jet and gone off on a private mission of their own, simply to save themselves the embarrassment of this election. </PARA>
<PARA> Fancy Senator Robert Ray and fancy Senator Burns accusing members of the Liberal Party of not raising their voices about improper tendering! They have the absolute hide to do that. They have only got to look in a mirror. I could ask about Ravenshoe. Why has the Government not done something about Ravenshoe? I refer to the mismanagement of almost $8m of Commonwealth money that has been spent there. We have been asking for inquiries; I am continuing at the moment on a general business motion to get that whole matter referred to an inquiry. The Government says, `Don't bother doing that. We are having the police look at it. We are having the Director of Public Prosecutions look at it'. But nothing comes up. Again we might ask: what has the ALP got to hide? Why does it not come clean with this? I raised in Estimates also the question of the loss of another $4m on a bungled fitout that Senator Bolkus could not handle properly in his Department. I still cannot get answers to that. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things are very improper and show that the ALP does not care a skerrick about using public moneys or about misusing public moneys when it suits it. I just hope that the people of Queensland will, this weekend, tell the Labor Party, as the Western Australian public have told the Labor Party over there, that they will not tolerate that sort of dishonesty, that misuse of public funds to use taxpayers' money to jet off on frolics. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the people of Queensland will be aware of that, will notice it, and will make their decision known this weekend at the two by-elections in Queensland. They will tell the Government that they are not prepared to put up with the dishonesty. While they are at it, they will tell the Federal Government that they will not put up with the record unemployment it has created in the `depression that we had to have'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use the occasion of the matters of public interest debate to continue examining a serious matter that was raised during the examinations by Senate Estimates Committee A. I use this occasion because it was not raised as a reservation. Although the matter was raised yesterday, the answer was unsatisfactory and did not provide the true position of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Therefore, I could have been challenged by using the forums of the committee stage of the debate to further this particular examination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a case that has already been raised in the lower House by our colleague on the Government benches, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), in a grievance debate on the legal system as he saw it. I commend him on the action that he took and the concern with which he debated this issue as a legal matter. I have looked at it from the taxation aspect. After all, it was an action inspired by the Australian Taxation Office that resulted in the gaoling of this poor single lady. </PARA>
<PARA> During this debate two taxation cases were contrasted and the treatment by the courts was explored. The first case concerned a Canberra solicitor who did not have to pay $230,000 in tax, because of a misplaced decimal point. He had to pay only $25,000. No gaol sentence occurred here. In fact, he benefited from not having to pay his debts. </PARA>
<PARA> The second case concerns a single parent who, deserted by her husband, bankrupt and unable to pay her tax, eventually went to gaol for failure, as she understood it, to do so. This case is usually referred to as the Moorby case. The original sum of the tax liability involved here was around $5,000 or so. I hasten to add that a much larger sum than this was involved in fines imposed by the courts for the non-payment of this tax and for the continued failure to pay the original fines. </PARA>
<PARA> The fines eventually totalled $9,200, to be shared by her ex-husband and herself. Thus, the eventual amount of money that this deserted, bankrupt mother had to pay was a figure of the order of $7,000 or more. Her ex-husband was also liable for an equal amount as they were both partners-at an earlier stage-in the business that got into trouble. An extenuating circumstance throughout the entire ordeal was that Mrs Moorby was under extreme emotional and financial stress. She found it difficult throughout the ordeal even to meet the instalment payments. </PARA>
<PARA> During the recent Estimates hearings I raised questions about the procedures followed by the Australian Taxation Office in both cases. This week I received the Australian Taxation Office's explanation of what had happened in the Moorby case, and it raises a number of concerns. The Estimates answer I received states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the fact of the particular case is that the taxpayer was gaoled for non payment of court fines and not for failure to pay any outstanding tax as has been suggested in the question. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Taxation Office's version. Mrs Moorby's version is that she did not realise that there was a distinction between the non-payment of the court fines and the non-payment of her tax liability. Fair enough-we do not expect everybody to be a Queen's Counsel. As far as she understood, her imprisonment was for both and in a sense, I suppose, she was right. </PARA>
<PARA> This point of view was corroborated by the courts' treatment of her case while she was in goal. Mrs Moorby was, and is, an upright citizen. She is a woman who ran a small business with her husband, a woman who ended up being deserted and left with a large amount of debts which she attempted to pay. Overall, she is highly respected in her township. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of her community were so incensed that they, not the Taxation Office that instigated her being there, came to her aid while she was in prison. The township, in fact, raised the $7,000 needed to pay her debts-a commendable action on the behalf of the community. This $7,000 included her taxation liability-and this is the point-and her fines. When the full amount was paid, Mrs Moorby's sentence was shortened and she was allowed to leave gaol.</PARA>
<PARA> If the imprisonment was not for failure to pay taxation liability but for the non-payment of fines, why was this not explained to her and only the money for the fines raised and the rest allowed to be paid off in instalments? The community was asked to pay something more in terms of its sympathy for this lady than it really had to pay. As I understand it, this did not happen?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer given by the Australian Taxation Office to my Estimates question gives the wrong impression. The important point is that the answer given virtually exonerates the Australian Taxation Office and puts all the blame on the courts. However, in Mrs Moorby's mind, the court fines and the non-payment of tax were all part of the one crime. I think most of us here would agree with that proposition. I think it is petty of the Australian Taxation Office to excuse the situation by putting the blame on the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> To give credit where it is due, the Australian Taxation Office had offered to allow the payment of the taxation liability and the fines by instalment before her arrest. However, it was the courts which issued the warrants for her arrest and the courts which insisted that the tax liability and the fines be paid before she could be released. But it was the ATO which prosecuted Mrs Moorby in the first place for failure to comply with its requirements. It was the Australian Taxation Office, which had not investigated the situation thoroughly, which brought it to court. </PARA>
<PARA> This case, naturally, is not black and white. Mrs Moorby did do some wrong. The Australian Tax Office did attempt to allow her to pay by instalments and did advise the court that it had no opposition to the court accepting payment of fines by instalment. The courts did fine her a number of times and was harsh in terms of her prison treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, what the case points out is the inadequacies in our present system of handling cases like Mrs Moorby's and particularly the role of the Australian Taxation Office. These inadequacies are as follows: firstly, are the guidelines or processes followed by the Australian Taxation Office for people struggling to pay their taxation liability sufficient to discern the genuine cases from the fake or the put-on cases? I do not believe they are. If they were, would this case ever have gone to the courts? The only contact during the final notices to pay the tax was by letter. The same occurred with the court fines. Mrs Moorby did not appear. The matter was heard ex parte. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, why did the Australian Taxation Office not encourage Mrs Moorby to apply to the taxation relief board? We read in the Budget Speech that this Government wants to do away with this board as an economy measure. Why did not the Australian Taxation Office tell her of the availability of this sort of relief? Relief would have been given in most cases with extenuating circumstances such as those I have referred to. She would not have been taken away to gaol in front of her crying children. Without prejudging the situation, she probably would have received assistance from the taxation relief board and she would not have had to struggle so much. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines should be such that a case like Mrs Moorby's should not arise. The purpose of my speech today is to make sure that there is never a repetition of this disgusting situation anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the treatment of these cases by the courts and the prisons also needs review. Mrs Moorby was treated as if she were a hardened criminal. She was fingerprinted and transported, without breakfast, in a paddy-wagon from the Hunter Valley to Sydney. Once in Sydney, she was body searched, made to shower in the presence of a male guard and locked up with a drug afflicted prisoner, with a murderess in a nearby cell. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague in the lower House has stated, the punishment should fit the crime. Failure to pay fines for not paying taxation liability in such circumstances-when a person is insolvent, has subsequently gone bankrupt, is under severe financial and emotional stress, is unemployed and is still the supporter of two children-does not deserve a gaol sentence. This is an indictment of both the courts and the Australian Taxation Office. I call for the presentation to the Senate of guidelines to ensure that the procedures that are adopted in such circumstances are humane. I ask the relevant Minister to respond immediately because the charge is serious. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak today on a matter which is of continuing concern to me, the ability of the Commonwealth to prevent and to detect fraud. I have had a long interest in this matter, going back to at least the time when the Commonwealth Government had a report presented to it entitled Review of Systems for Dealing with Fraud on the Commonwealth. That was in 1987. The report was the subject of some questioning of the Minister, Senator Tate, in the Estimates committee hearings in late 1987. I have pursued the matter subsequently in Estimates committees examining the Department of Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak today because charges have now been laid against three individuals who, it is alleged, have been operating a system of frauds against the Commonwealth. I do not intend, obviously, to go into the details of the case which will be heard before the courts. But the allegations are that there is a network operating to defraud the Commonwealth, based on improper authorisation of invoices and the stealing and conversion of cheques. It is alleged that the fraud against the Commonwealth in that case would total about $600,000. That is only one case that is coming before the courts. I notice that there has been no official announcement by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) or the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) of this claim of large amounts of fraud against the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Another case coming up is an alleged fraud of a quarter of a million dollars against the Department of Defence, and there is another one alleging the theft of $13,000 from the Department of Defence by an employee of that Department. I know that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) has acknowledged that every allegation of fraud that has been referred to the Defence Inspector-General so far has revealed elements of waste and mismanagement and the abuse of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very glad to think that there is an Inspector-General in the Department of Defence. I am concerned that the people under his authority are so few in number. I think something like seven people are employed by the Inspector-General in the Department of Defence. By comparison, some tens of thousands of people work in the comparable office in the United States Department of Defense. That is an indicator of the lack of importance we place on prosecuting and pursuing fraud. We seem to have a laid-back approach. Despite all the warnings we have been given by people who know well what we should be facing and what we are facing, we are inclined to disregard the warnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did the 1987 report tell the Government just what needed to be done but also the recommendations were really quite important. They were summarised just recently by the Auditor-General in his report No. 25. He said that the main thrust of the review of fraud was that agencies should take responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud against their programs. They should also investigate routine instances of fraud against their programs, improve communication and develop formal links with the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to allow resourcing in the AFP and DPP to be responsive to the demands resulting from agency activity and fraud matters. He also said that agencies should develop the use of administrative remedies as a cost-effective means of dealing with minor instances of fraud and they should cooperate in law enforcement efforts. The report went on in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I was concerned that Defence moved very, very slowly to put in place a fraud control report. It was not, I think, until 1989 that it was actually up and operating. That was one indicator of the lack of urgency which the Department of Defence and its former Minister, Mr Beazley, accorded to the control or prevention of fraud against that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Another indicator was that after Mr Beazley and I had both been approached by an employee in the Department of Defence with allegations of fraud against the Commonwealth, it was a year before Mr Beazley allowed two AFP officers, who were offered by Senator Tate, into his Department to work on controlling and preventing fraud. I think it is quite disgraceful that for one year the AFP was not allowed to help the Department of Defence in fraud control measures. It was an indicator, once again, of the lack of a sense of urgency by the Minister in controlling his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence expenditure is extraordinarily large. After all, $3.1 billion is spent on defence equipment and stores, on procurement, acquisitions and projects. Similarly, the Department of Administrative Services has a budget of $2.7 billion for its involvement in property and construction, purchasing and disposal, printing and publishing, surveying, land transport and storage. These are all areas where the Commonwealth is enormously vulnerable to fraud. The Department of Administrative Services does a large amount of work for the Department of Defence in its expenditure and procurement. So there we have two major departments of state which are vulnerable and from which I have had employees come to me with allegations of waste, mismanagement and fraud in those departments. The allegations have been taken up eventually by the AFP and prosecutions have been launched in some cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about what happens to the individuals who, through a sense of duty, bring those breaches to the attention of the proper authorities. In three cases that have been brought to my attention, employees have, by one means or another, been harassed or have been pushed from the department concerned. They have either been included in planned, `phased' redundancies-and it is incredibly coincidental that they have been the people involved in those redundancies-or they have been scheduled for disciplinary action or downgrading, or expected to work in inadequate and difficult circumstances. These include such things as having to work in weapons rooms or in basements, or given jobs without the status commensurate with their experience and responsibility. I am very concerned about that, as I am about the lack of urgency in preventing the fraud in the first place. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I believe there is a lack of internal control. I am speaking particularly about that today. The time has come for the Department of Defence to look at and re-evaluate its fraud control plan. To do that, it should be asking for advice from the Australian Federal Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and also the Auditor-General. They are all organisations or individuals with expertise in various areas relating to the control of the finances of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should be looking also at whether the scrutiny that is being given to more junior officials in the Department is also being given in adequate form to more senior officials. It is my understanding that the level of scrutiny diminishes as officials become more and more senior. At the same time, those more senior officials have greater authority than the juniors. We should not allow that situation to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I support the devolution of financial authority in the Department of Defence, I am worried that, unless we are very, very careful, it will mean even greater vulnerability to fraud. I do not know that there is sufficient appreciation of, or a sense of urgency about, that. I have raised before the question of control over credit card usage by officials. I have not been terribly satisfied with the answers I have been given. There were official requests that the usage of cheques be reduced so that direct credit be the rule wherever possible. I think that is a very sensible measure to introduce wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Commander Allen of the AFP made a fairly well publicised speech last year on the whole question of fraud control in the Department of Defence. He gave a great deal of information about the situation in the United States and contrasted that with Australia's. He also raised some of the matters which I have alluded to. He pointed out that, as a result of this devolution policy, by the end of 1990 we will see some 3,000 personnel engaged in the procurement process. That is a large number of people with authority to spend money for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also think about the conflicts of interests that occur sometimes when people are involved in procurement. We should be looking at collusion between defence personnel and contractors. That is a very great problem for us that we should be warned about. I have also been very concerned about the question of post-separation employment, but I do not think the Government shows much concern about it. There is also the question of collusive bidding and tendering. </PARA>
<PARA> Commander Allen said that what we need is `aggressive policy and prosecution'. I could not agree with him more. One of the things that we lack is sufficient legislation. I know that the Inspector-General, Mr Harvey, told the Estimates Committee examining the estimates for the Department of Defence that the Americans have a great proliferation of legislation and he referred to the fact that they also have a lot of prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of our problems is that we do not have sufficient legislation. I draw the Senate's attention to the shadow Attorney-General's legislation introduced last year to try to beef up the approach to crime and corruption against the Commonwealth. The Federal Government took no notice of that legislation at all and I ask why it did not do so. What is it that holds its hand? Do we all not have an interest in seeing that fraud against the Commonwealth is stopped?</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth should be looking at whistle-blowers legislation. We are not going to get people coming forward when they know of individuals being harassed or forced out of the Public Service if they do what they see as their duty. Everywhere one turns there seems to be a lack of urgency to push ahead with the measures that we need, the zeal that we need, the legislation that we need and the resources that we need in the AFP or the Inspector-General's area. If we are serious about finding the fraud that I believe is there, we should be doing what is needed to combat it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should explain, first of all, why it did not make a public announcement about this $600,000 worth of alleged fraud against the Department of Defence. It should tell us why it seems to be prepared to pick up the pieces afterwards but is not prepared to put enough effort into the prevention of fraud. Why are efforts so slack and inadequate? Fraud is going to become a greater and greater problem the more we ignore it. It is the most fertile field for individuals and organised crime, yet this Government seems to be prepared to sit on its hands and allow it to go ahead. Why is the Government not prepared to pick up the shadow Attorney-General's legislation that he introduced into the Parliament last year? Nothing has been done about it at all. Why is the Government not prepared to introduce whistle-blowers legislation to protect individuals? Why do we have to sit back and read about the fraud in the crime pages of our newspapers once it has been committed? It is not good enough. I only wish that I had much longer to speak because the amount of material that is available on this question should all be on the public record and people should be alerted to the lack of urgency with which this Government is approaching it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this discussion of matters of public interest as a result of an answer given to the Senate yesterday by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). He was responding to a question I had asked the day before about Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) meat inspectors working at Wodonga. In doing so, I want to paint a picture of this particular works so that the chamber has some idea of what I am talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Wodonga Meats Pty Ltd is operating at full capacity, it processes approximately 400 cattle and 2,500 sheep per day. It employs between 350 and 400 people. Its export sales per week are worth more than $1m, and its export markets include the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, the Middle East, Russia and Taiwan. Currently, because of the continuing disputation in the meat industry and at Wodonga itself, the works is employing approximately 140 people and its capacity is working at about 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As I run through some of the points and issues involved, I am sure honourable senators will realise that there is no reason that this works-which is one of a number throughout Australia that have been bedevilled by industrial bandits and lawlessness over the last 18 months to two years-could not get back to full capacity quickly and employ some of those 9.9 per cent of people in this country who have not got jobs, thereby assisting in overcoming our current account problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the answer which I received yesterday, the first point I want to make is that I found it absolutely incredible that on the day I asked my question the Minister had to admit to this chamber that he did not know anything about what had been going on at Wodonga, particularly in relation to the AQIS inspectors. He is directly responsible in the Senate for the functioning of that particular department. The answer given to us yesterday reads, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>I have been advised by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that meat inspectors working at Wodonga Meats are not engaging in a work to rule campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>The thrust of my question related to that work to rule campaign. Yet according to the local newspaper, the Federal Secretary of the Meat Inspectors Association, Mr Don Ford, said that inspectors would be working by the book and not assisting the abattoirs. `Working by the book' is jargon for working to rule. On checking with the management today I found that, in its opinion, Mr Don Ford was correct and the answer that was given to me yesterday was incorrect. The Minister should pursue this matter and make sure that the people employed by AQIS, which is now totally industry funded, get in there and do their job. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go a little further down the line and look at the situation in Wodonga. The headquarters of 23 meat inspectors are at Wodonga and the company is paying for 14 of them. That is the core number of inspectors required during normal production. The total cost is $910,000 per year, or $65,000 per man. The company is still paying for all of those inspectors, even though it has work for only six of them. Therefore, eight are being paid but they are not working. There have been a number of problems, apart from working to rule, at Wodonga. I refer to such things as coming back late from morning tea breaks and lunch, and not turning up when the men have been working after hours and loading, all of which exacerbate existing problems. Before saying more about Wodonga, I wish to pick up a reference in the Minister's answer yesterday which I do not believe befits a Minister in this place. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . employees whom I think the union might call scabs. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the Minister thinks that those 140 people who are prepared to work there and keep the wheels of industry turning are to be applauded for their action in that they are prepared to stand up and are prepared to work. They do not want to be in the dole lines; they just want to get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the concern for safety which has been expressed in press reports. Obviously, I am as concerned about safety as anybody else. At this moment an inspector is talking to the people on the picket line. It is also interesting to note that the company also employs a departmental veterinary officer at a cost of $93,000 a year. That person has had no problems whatsoever in passing through the picket line and to go to work. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to examine some of the aspects of the Wodonga dispute. For 23 months the Wodonga Meats Pty Ltd export abattoir at Wodonga has been the victim of protracted industrial action by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU). A State-wide campaign of rolling strikes has continued to plague the Victorian export meat industry and, I would add, the Australian industry-we had a problem at Robb Jetty, Western Australia, just last week-because some employers have refused to enter into agreements outside the wage principles of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I emphasise `the wage principles of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission' because that is the law under which we operate now. </PARA>
<PARA> After 45 strikes in 10 months throughout the Victorian meat processing industry, the Industrial Relations Commission set up the national meat inquiry-the Harrison inquiry. It recommended, and this was accepted by the parties, that all existing terms and conditions that applied throughout the meat industry should continue to apply with no strike action while the inquiry was being conducted. Since then, 72 days production totalling approximately $70m in lost export revenue and representing more than 21,000 man days has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> In chronological order, the history of the Wodonga dispute is as follows: since May 1989, there have been 72 strike days. On 8 January 1991, Deputy President Riordan inserted a bans clause in the Victorian award. The AMIEU has refused to abide by the Commission decision and has breached the bans clause on several occasions throughout the State. At Wodonga there have been 12 breaches of the bans clause since 8 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> On Monday, 8 April there was a further stoppage. On Friday, 12 April Wodonga Meats Pty Ltd commenced giving final written warnings to 14 union delegates that they would be dismissed if they continued to breach the bans clause and the settlement of disputes procedure. Within two hours of receiving the final warning, 11 delegates breached the bans clause and called a strike for the rest of Friday, 12 April and Monday, 15 April. The 11 delegates were dismissed. On Tuesday, 16 April a picket was established and an indefinite strike was called at Wodonga Meats abattoir over the dismissal of the delegates. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday, 16 April 1991 Wodonga Meats Pty Ltd advised that the Victorian Export Meatworks Agreement 1987 was thereby cancelled because of the continued breaches of the bans clause and the settlement of the disputes procedure. From Tuesday, 16 April to Thursday, 18 April more than 30 meatworkers continued to attend the abattoir to work and I congratulate them for wanting to keep their jobs. Management decided not to kill on Friday, 19 April because of violent attacks the previous afternoon by picketers against the workers who continued to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The company sought meetings with the Wodonga police to develop strategies to ensure the safety of workers-AMIEU people who wished to work, other union employees and new applicants reported by the Commonwealth Employment Service as at Friday, 19 April to be in excess of 200-and to ensure there would be no repeat of the previous day's unlawful incidents. </PARA>
<PARA> Employees were advised on Tuesday, 16 April that they had until 5 p.m., Thursday, 18 April 1991 to indicate their intention to resume work to qualify for the company's offer that the terms and conditions and rates of pay that applied under the cancelled agreement would continue to apply provided they agreed to work five days a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Employees would be required to complete an individual employment agreement which included a clause stating that they would be prepared to work five days a week when required without any bans, strikes or limitations in accordance with the bans clause and the settlement of disputes procedure. On Thursday, 18 April this deadline was extended to 5 p.m., Monday, 22 April because there was confusion surrounding the issue of which terms and conditions and rates of pay would apply. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue really highlights the bloody-mindedness that has occurred in this industry over a significant period. It highlights the fact that there are people who want to work and earn a decent living; that there are people who want to keep this industry operating. And yet, these people are continually harassed, continually interfered with and continually prevented from going about their normal business. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer that I was given yesterday referred to `scabs'. I was told that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service meat inspectors were not engaging in a work to rule campaign. When we compare those comments with what Mr Don Ford has said and with what management has reported to us, the serious problem that we have in terms of the current situation with AQIS is succinctly highlighted. One could well allege that there is collusion between some of the inspectors at this works and people on the picket line. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised this matter in this place before. The time has come for the Government, which has responsibility for AQIS, to take firm and strong action immediately as far as our meat industry is concerned. It must ensure that there is reasonable industrial practice in this country. I repeat what I have said in this place before: the Federal Government should adopt the same approach to this matter that it adopted with regard to the Builders Labourers Federation and the airline pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should immediately move for deregistration of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. The members of that union have continually frustrated the meat industry. They have continually abused the rulings of the various commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is about time that the Government carried out its responsibilities in respect of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in this place before, this very important industry contributes to this country some $3 billion in export earnings. In recent times, this contribution has been seriously eroded. Rural markets are depressed and rural producers, not only in this country but internationally, are in crisis. It is time that a firm stand was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who is at the table, the Federal Government and, in particular, Senator Peter Cook: it is time to stop talking about the antics that have been going on in this industry and the walkout by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the AMIEU from the Harrison inquiry with three days to go. It is time to take some positive action. The best way to get our meatworks operating again at full steam or full throttle is to proceed immediately with the deregistration of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Collins) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That the sitting of the Senate be suspended till 2 p.m. </PARA>

<PARA>It is my view that the public sector is not a sector that should lead in setting wage movements and not a sector which should come last either, but is a sector that should move with the generality and not be the pacesetter.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The public sector is not a pacesetter in these circumstances. The public sector is providing a model for other sectors in the economy to emulate. The proposal that we have put, which is not yet an agreement, provides for negotiations on a productivity basis in the public sector and, on the basis of achieved and demonstrated productivity improvement, a wage increase. The effect of that proposal, if adopted, will be that unit labour costs in the public sector will decline; there will be no cost-push pressures because of it in the economy. The benefits of that reduced cost in the public sector can be taken, and ought to be, in some percentage in wages for those who have helped generate that higher productivity, in greater flexibility in the budgets of the agencies of the public sector, and possibly globally, in the sense that it may contribute towards an easing of the taxation levels. They are the possible outcomes. As a consequence, it is a formula for fighting a recession rather than reacting to the pressures of a recession. If it were emulated in the private sector, it would mean that we would be able to grow this economy out of recession.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition senators have shown in recent weeks a lack of appreciation in the area and a lack of sensitivity as to the need to assist Australian business in government purchasing. I would appreciate it if Opposition senators would keep quiet to get the full import of this answer before they haggle again. Overseas enthusiasm is strong. As I said, the Central Unit on Purchasing in the United Kingdom Treasury has been seeking to develop closer working relationships with Australia. It has sought and we have given it copyright waiver on our guide to specification writing to allow the United Kingdom to use the material for its own purchasing officers. Also it is collaborating with us in our work on risk management in government purchasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This does not apply only to the United Kingdom. In the United States of America, for instance, we have just given a paper on purchasing reform to the seventy-sixth international purchasing conference in San Francisco, at which most of the delegates were from the private sector. It was well received and as a consequence the city of Las Vegas wants to examine our system very closely with a view to implementation, and we have had contact with the Federal United States General Service Administration, the equivalent in the US of our Department of Administrative Services. It is impressed and in its contacts with us has expressed the enormity of the problem the Americans are having in going down the road as far as we have. They are stuck, for instance, with 15 inches of regulation compared with our three and a half pages. Reform there is a long way off, but they are interested in what we are doing. It is not just the United States and the United Kingdom which have expressed an interest. The head of the Hong Kong Government Supplies will soon be visiting Australia to study how we do things.</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, as a result of the international interest, I am pleased to be able to say that interest in our purchasing reforms has excited such interest overseas that we have been asked to host the fifth international colloquium on public sector procurement. We have agreed to do that and the conference will now be held in Australia in 1992. It is a great honour for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were early reports including one, I think, from World Vision that the death toll may have reached as high as 1.5 million in Bangladesh as a result of that awful cyclone on 30 April. However, on the basis of subsequent reports it does seem that the death toll is not of that order of magnitude, even though the tragedy remains nothing less than horrific. Current official estimates put the number of dead at close to 140,000 with a similar number injured, and an additional 50,000 people now suffering from diarrhoea and related illnesses. In human and material terms, the situation in Bangladesh is clearly a devastating catastrophe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> National and international efforts to deal with the disaster in Bangladesh have at last been gaining real momentum over the past few days. Reports reaching us from our High Commission in Dhaka and other sources confirm that assistance is now getting through. Australia's response has been primarily a financial one with a total of $2.25m in two packages of emergency assistance. Those funds will be used to supply food, water, medicine, shelter, materials, clothing, blankets and other priority goods. Of this amount, as of a couple of days ago, the Australian High Commission had already disbursed some $250,000. That emergency assistance is in addition to 50,000 tonnes of wheat which is being provided as part of Australia's regular program of assistance and funds which have been diverted from the direct aid program and the special activities scheme which are administered by our High Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that government assistance, Australian non-government organisations have made a tremendous contribution. A Boeing 747 carrying approximately 90 tonnes of food, medicines and blankets arrived in Dhaka the night before last and has been unloaded. That flight was chartered by Care Australia, and the Australian Government contributed 60 tonnes of high protein biscuits valued at $250,000 to the manifest for that flight.</PARA>
<PARA> Coming to the last part of the question-while it is difficult to target emergency assistance, when speed of delivery to those in greatest need is our primary objective, women and children will benefit directly from much of this assistance. Furthermore, I should say that of programmable bilateral assistance to Bangladesh this year, almost 50 per cent of it, that is to say, over $5m, is quite specifically directed towards women and children through population, family health and nutrition programs and the vulnerable group development program, so-called, which earmarks 20,000 of the 50,000 tonnes of Australian food aid, which I mentioned, specifically for women and children.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Before I ask the question I would ask whether Senator Evans could adjust his microphone so that those of us at this end of the chamber can hear his answer. I wonder, too, whether other Ministers will do likewise. They seem not to want the microphone to interfere with the television coverage of their answers. I ask, firstly: will the Dalai Lama be received as a guest of the Government when he visits Australia next year and will he be met by the Prime Minister? Secondly, if the answer to either of those questions is no, can the Minister explain why the Dalai Lama, a Nobel peace prize winner, who is the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan people, would be accorded a lesser status than both Nelson Mandela who, while worthy of the honours bestowed on him, is neither the spiritual leader nor political leader of his people, and President Turgut Ozal, whose human rights record has been publicly criticised by the Prime Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the information available to me, it is possible that the Dalai Lama will visit Australia in April-May next year. Interim committees consisting of private individuals have been established in several Australian States to organise the visit. As yet we have been without any formal approach so far as such a visit is concerned. There has certainly been no specific request made for meetings with me or the Prime Minister. Accordingly, the Prime Minister has not yet given any consideration to whether he will meet the Dalai Lama.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned I have already said, on the public record in a radio interview when I was asked this question on 13 March, that I will be happy to meet with the Dalai Lama, especially in light of his international standing, both as a religious leader and as a Nobel prize winner. I am particularly concerned to discuss with him the human rights situation in Tibet, which continues to be the subject of some very distressing reports about limitations on religious and political dissent and the imprisonment and torture of the people involved in such dissent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, I should say, has expressed this concern to the Chinese authorities on many occasions, most recently at ministerial level during my recent visit to China when I addressed that whole question of human rights and in particular made reference, to both my foreign ministerial counterpart Qian Qichen and also to Premier Li Peng, to the situation in Tibet.</PARA>
<PARA> It is our judgment that it would not be appropriate for the Government to extend guest of government status to the Dalai Lama. It is the case that guest of government status is occasionally accorded to prominent individuals who have no particular political office at the time. Nelson Mandela was one, although I find it odd to hear Senator Powell say that he is not a political leader of his people because manifestly he is. Quite apart from Nelson Mandela, from time to time other people have been given that status. However, normally that status is accorded only to people who are representatives of states or governments with which Australia has diplomatic relations.</PARA>
<PARA> Where a question arises, however indirectly, of competing claims for recognition of sovereign statehood or competing claims of independence, clearly it is difficult to treat as a guest of government an individual who is involved in such claims purely on his or her own terms as a prominent individual, be it as a spiritual leader or a Nobel prize winner. It does become a question of diplomacy and political significance as to how that person is regarded and treated by the host government. Given the Dalai Lama's association with the Tibetan government in exile, so-called, the Australian Government really could only accord the Dalai Lama guest of government status were we willing to support a bid by the Tibetan people for independence from China, which we are not.</PARA>
<PARA> It does need to be made clear that the Australian Government recognises that Tibet is part of China. Discussions between the Dalai Lama, myself and anyone else in the Government would therefore only proceed in the context of Tibet's status as an autonomous region in China. As I have already indicated, while we are prepared, in our discussions with Chinese authorities, to take up as often as is necessary questions of human rights in Tibet, we are not prepared to talk about the question of independence with Tibet. It simply has to be acknowledged that Tibet has just not been recognised by the international community as a sovereign state in the way that was the case with Kuwait, and such like. Accordingly, quite difficult and sensitive issues arise if one gets into that sort of territory.</PARA>

Can the Minister also advise honourable senators of the terms of those guidelines?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3510" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table documents which I have released to the media today, including a general statement on wages policy, a list of government guidelines on workplace bargaining and a framework agreement for accord mark VI in improvements to Australian government employment. Today I announced measures which pioneer the transition to a new wages system in Australia. I have proposed to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), and I will be proposing to employers as well, a framework for its agreement to a set of guidelines on enterprise bargaining which will simultaneously allow Australia to grow out of the recession and at the same time continue with the lowering inflation objective of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987, with the decision on the second tier wage increase, massive award restructuring changes were started in the awards around Australia. That process has to continue. It has now reached a point where the benefits of that process can be achieved at workplace level. When they do, the productivity growth, because of that significant and massive change, will begin to appear. Given that we have reached this point, it is our view that we should not stall or go back; we should go on and achieve those gains. Therefore we need a set of guidelines, in the present hiatus over wage fixing, to guide the various players in enterprise negotiation. For that reason, the Government has developed such a set of guidelines based on accord mark VI.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the guidelines will underpin higher productivity and ensure that there will be no wages break-out during the recovery cycle of the economy. We will require a commitment from the ACTU to work within the guidelines and ensure that they are adopted by the unions affiliated to the ACTU. If this commitment is given, the Government will be in a position to proceed with accord mark VI agreements reached with public sector unions.</PARA>
<PARA> I will be discussing with employers the application for guidelines as soon as possible. The guidelines themselves will ensure that real productivity gains are delivered; that workplace agreements contain no extra claims commitments; that workplace agreements be for a defined period; and that all increases be consistent with agreed aggregate wage outcomes compatible with declining inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the guidelines there will be continuing falls in real unit labour costs. Therefore, the productivity related wages available under accord mark VI will contribute to further falls in inflation and will enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the Australian economy. This will improve Australia's growth prospects with associated benefits for employers.</PARA>
<PARA> The public sector, as much as any other sector, must accelerate the process of achieving productive change in its workplaces. The accord mark VI agreement, in the Australian Public Service, provides for $12 payable from today in return for a commitment to continue the process of award restructuring; three wage increases over a 16-month period strictly conditional on demonstrated productivity achievements at a market rate survey; and a no extra claims commitment for the life of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> Government business enterprises will be free to develop their own workplace agreements to reinforce their commercial identities and to improve their effectiveness and competitiveness. This pioneering agreement in the public sector, with its insistence on achieved productivity, is a model for workplace bargaining throughout the economy. It is a vital ingredient in the economic recipe required to secure a productive and internationally competitive Australia.</PARA>

On 4 December 1990 I advised the Senate that a comprehensive energy audit was under way. I can now report that the energy audit has been completed. The energy auditor has supported the thrust of the Joint House Department's engineering services section's energy conservation program, which has included: recommissioning and balancing of air-conditioning and ventilation systems; installation, where possible, of lighting time-block controls; adjustment to water temperatures and volume in heating and cooling circuits; installation of power factor correction capacitators; and installation, on a progressive basis, where appropriate, of energy efficient lamps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Approximately 18 per cent of consumption, or $700,000, has been saved over the past two years. By continuing with present initiatives and with recommendations of the energy auditor, it is estimated that a further $180,000 will be saved next financial year. Further savings are anticipated in the future as the energy conservation program is fully implemented. However, the savings will not be as dramatic as they were initially.</PARA>
<PARA> It is planned to extend the use of energy efficient globes to replace incandescent globes in corridors, desk lamps and in the Great Hall. Tenders for energy efficient lamps have been called.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that an agreement has been reached at Forgacs docks in Newcastle. I understand that that agreement was reached between the company and the unions on this occasion. There was some industrial action at the site but I note that the company did not refer that matter of industrial action to the Industrial Relations Commission for settlement, as is its entitlement and as it would do if it believed that that action was imposing on it demands that were unreasonable or unfair. If that industrial action was doing that, I would have recommended to the company that it refer the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission so that the matter could then be brought within its ambit for settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I have to say to the balance of Senator Tierney's question is this: a month ago today the Industrial Relations Commission brought down a national wage case decision offering up to a 2.5 per cent increase for Australian workers, subject to their giving guarantees to continue award restructuring, not asking for any extra claims and giving up some productivity give-backs to their companies. In relation to that decision, which is a month old, no union in this country-except for perhaps one-approaching the Industrial Relations Commission made an application for that increase.</PARA>
<PARA> We have here a case of institutional failure in the wages system. In the face of no applications by unions, there is a hiatus on wage settlements in Australia. That is exactly what the Government has moved to fill today in issuing the guidelines on enterprise level negotiation that I have issued. If those guidelines are accepted by the ACTU today-or whenever it accepts them; I hope it will be very soon-what we will have in this hiatus is a set of rules by which wage negotiations can proceed at an enterprise level aimed at generating productivity and then sharing that in a fair way between the customer, the owner and the worker.</PARA>
<PARA> That is a responsible approach by the Government in the face of what has been a very difficult time in wage fixation in Australia. For Senator Tierney or anyone else to slip back into the old street fighter approach about industrial relations-the old blast from the past-and attack unions and many employers who are agreeing to the accord, is simply not recognising the fundamental shift that is being made in Australia today in relating wages to productivity so that we can grow this economy out of recession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I touched on the anticipation of interest rate cuts in answer to a question about the inflation rate. Yesterday's consumer price index figure has led to a reduction in both official and bank interest rates. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut official interest rates by a further one per cent this morning. The official cash rates are now 10.5 per cent, 7 1/2 per cent lower than their peak in late 1989. Private banks and money markets have reacted immediately to this cut with the 90-day bank bills falling to 10.4 per cent and 10-year bond rates falling to 10.5 per cent. At least one bank, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, has cut the variable housing mortgage rate by a full percentage point to 13 per cent. Other banks are to meet over the next day or so to review their rates. I am informed that the banks also expect to make announcements soon regarding their rates offered to business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These interest rate cuts and yesterday's fall in inflation are positive news for Australia's economic prospects, a confirmation of the fact that this Government is removing business cost impediments to an improved trade performance, particularly through lowering the cost of capital in Australia, which is very largely determined by the ratio between inflation and interest rates. With the annual inflation rate less than 5 per cent and business interest rates coming down on the back of this inflation figure, real interest rates are now more in line with those of our trading partners.</PARA>

It may be third time lucky for Senator Olsen, but I do not suppose that it will be. I have already made clear that the advice received from Commissioner Burdekin was advice received prior to the introduction of the Bill. It goes without saying, therefore, that the advice was not based on a final version of the Bill, the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum. That is the first point one should take into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have also stated quite consistently that, in framing the legislation, we have acted squarely in accordance with the advice of the Attorney-General's Department.

But we have had a discussion already. He has undertaken to come back to me with constructive suggestions on how to deal with any difficulties he may have in assessing the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen makes some assertions as to what the Government's basis was for proceeding with this legislation. I have said before that we will consider Commissioner Burdekin and whatever views he might have. The Government has consistently made it very clear, both beforehand and in the second reading speech made by Mr Beazley last Thursday night, that our primary object in putting forward this legislation is that the ban is directed squarely at preventing potential corruption and undue influence in the political process. Senator Olsen may not have noticed it, but in the same passage of that speech the Government clearly stated that it had carefully considered the implications of the proposal on the right to freedom of speech, both as it is generally accepted and specifically under international law.</PARA>
<PARA> It is probably worth quoting a little further from Mr Beazley's second reading speech. He said of our international obligations:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a party, requires parties to guarantee the right of freedom of expression. This right is not absolute.</PARA>
<PARA> Article 19 (3) of the covenant provides that the right may be limited in the interests of public order.</PARA>
<PARA>Regardless of whatever assessment anyone makes as to the effect of article 19 (2), the Government is satisfied that the prevention of potential corruption and undue influence of our political process falls squarely within the meaning of the limitation `in the interests of public order'. As such, we are satisfied that the proposals are a necessary and proportionate response to this threat and do not constitute a breach of our international obligations. I add again, for the information of Senator Olsen, that the position of the Government is squarely in accordance with the advice of our official advisers, the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA> I have to make one quite ironic point about Senator Olsen and the point that he is pursuing. It has been the Opposition in this place and the Opposition in the other place which have consistently over the best part of a decade opposed any initiative by government or by community organisations in this country to protect and to entrench rights of individuals, either through constitutional amendment or through legislation in this place.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen may shake his head, but it is his Opposition which is still committed to the abolition of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; it is his Opposition which opposed its creation; and it is his Opposition, particularly in this place, which consistently opposed constitutional amendments designed to entrench in legislation basic principles-such as the right to vote; one vote, one value; rights of freedom of religion; trial by jury; and fair compensation-despite the fact that those proposals were endorsed by a widely based group in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Olsen comes in here as a latter day convert to the rights of individuals. His Party and the National Party by his actions, both here and in State legislatures, have shown that they do not in any way deserve to come in here under that pretence. It is quite clear from the underlying basis of his question that he has not understood, and does not now understand, the need for principles in this area. We know what the articles mean. We know what articles 19 (2) and 19 (3) mean. We know that the Government's proposals are in accordance with those principles. For Senator Olsen and everyone else, let me state once again that the advice of our official advisers is that we are acting in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>

By way of preamble, I mention that the latest copy of the Australian Way contains a special section with several advertisements from manufacturers claiming the manufacture of environmentally superior products. One two-page advertisement contains information from the car manufacturer, BMW. Inter alia, the material says that Australia has very lax vehicle emission standards, which are easily met by BMW, and that this confers on BMW the ability to export its cars to any country in the world. Firstly, how many countries have emissions standards more stringent than Australia? Secondly, if, as claimed, it is possible to meet standards 20 to 30 times more stringent than those now applying in Australia, why has the Government not mandated tighter controls? Thirdly, has the Government made lessening environmental impact a feature of its car plan, and, if not, why not?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services has given me an outline of an answer to the honourable senator's question. I can tell him that on 1 January 1991, when the Government extended fee relief assistance to the users of commercial and employer sponsored child-care centres, it was necessary to estimate the likely demand for fee relief from users for the first quarter of 1991. The estimated amount was advanced to services in early January of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In some cases, the estimate turned out to be incorrect. In cases where the advance was found to be insufficient, it was topped up. In other cases where, after the claims experience of the first quarter was known, it was found that the initial advance exceeded the likely need beyond 30 June 1991 action has been taken to recover the excess.</PARA>
<PARA> The second question asked whether the Department is trying to recover the money. As stated above, after the fee relief claims experience of the first quarter it was found that the initial advance was in excess of the amount needed up to 30 June. The excess amount is being recovered.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the problem of high initial advances, it should be obvious that the need to recover excess amounts will not occur in the future because the problem lay in making an estimate as to the initial advance that should be made. All subsequent fee relief advances will be based on the fee relief claims experience of the preceding quarter. This experience was not available for the first quarter and estimates had to be made of the income distribution of users in each service.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not considering making payments direct to parents. The existing system, whereby payments are made to about 2,300 services on behalf of the 110,000 users of these services, is extremely effective and efficient. Senator Walsh would recognise that the voucher option would require services to carry the cost until they claimed reimbursement. Monitoring expenditure and implementing meaningful fraud control procedures for such a system would be extremely costly and inefficient.</PARA>

What will the Government do to encourage State and Territory governments to adopt full disclosure laws?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the Saulwick poll and the very high levels of public support across the political spectrum for the disclosure of political party donations. I also note that the Saulwick poll questioned people as to why they considered political donations were made. It is interesting that only 19 per cent of the community believes that people make political donations to parties because they agree with their policies. The worrying part of the poll is that 75 per cent of the community believes that people make such donations to obtain influence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government clearly recognises the need for disclosure legislation, and we also recognise the need for uniform disclosure legislation throughout the country. Without such uniform approach covering all levels of government, public confidence in our system of political administration cannot be ensured. The type of cynicism which is obviously evidenced by the Saulwick poll results will be perpetuated without a uniform system of disclosure laws throughout Australia. To this effect, the Prime Minister will soon be writing to State and Territory governments calling on them to introduce disclosure legislation on a uniform basis. I also welcome the news that Victorian Government support will be expressed today in the introduction in its Parliament of legislation mirroring the Federal Government's disclosure legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note that the poll was restricted to questioning whether donations to political parties should be disclosed. The Government believes that disclosure should extend further than that to third parties which participate in the electoral process. With such disclosure, the public will be able to scrutinise the extent to which such third parties are involved in the process of government. We recognise the need to go further than just covering political parties. The need for such third party disclosure can be evidenced by the system in the United States of America, where political action committees run rampant, and also by the case in recent years of Community Polling in New South Wales. In that case, the New South Wales disclosure laws were shown to be totally inadequate. An organisation which was not technically a political party and did not technically participate in the last New South Wales elections was not required under New South Wales legislation to disclose fully the extent of its involvement in that election.</PARA>
<PARA> In reality, of course, we all know that Community Polling was a front organisation run out of the office of Dr Metherell, then a senior Liberal shadow spokesperson. The organisation contributed funds to Independent candidates in that election and it is no coincidence that those candidates' preferences went to the Liberal Party. I say that because in recent weeks on the Sunday program we had an assurance from Mr Greiner, when interviewed by Laurie Oakes, that everything in respect of Community Polling had been disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see how that took place under New South Wales legislation. Given the fact that the candidates who received donations following the last New South Wales election but are not contesting the forthcoming State election are not required under New South Wales law to disclose such donations, the public cannot with any degree of confidence accept Mr Greiner's latter day assurances. For instance, if New South Wales legislation were to apply to third parties, as the Government would propose on a uniform national level, this would not be an issue. Groups such as Community Polling would be required to disclose their contributions to candidates and to parties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am all too sadly aware of the reports coming out of Burma about the conditions under which the military regime appears to be reopening universities there and, in particular, the draconian conditions being placed upon students enrolling. This is, depressingly, all too typical of the pattern of repression which is becoming more and more evident in that unhappy country. All of this is a matter of great and continuing concern to the Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has not been even the slightest perceptible move by the State Law and Order Restoration Council to implement the results of the 1990 elections. Indeed, it is now increasingly difficult to avoid the conclusion that, as much as we hoped and believed otherwise at the time, that election was a fraud designed by the military only to flush out the next layer of dissident democratic leaders making it easier to move against all significant opposition groups, using increasingly intimidatory measures.</PARA>
<PARA> In spite of all these circumstances we have been giving thought to ways in which Australia can contribute to increasing international pressure on the Burmese authorities, designed to try to begin to get them to behave in a decent and democratic way. In the first place, there will be no relaxation of the current strict approach to our bilateral relationship with Burma and our Embassy in Rangoon will continue to use what limited links are available to us there to express again and again our very strong concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in a practical way the Embassy in Bangkok will pursue the situation of Burmese displaced persons in Thailand. In this respect, Dr Blewett has agreed that we should increase our humanitarian and medical assistance to these people to a figure of $100,000 this financial year. I have also instructed my Department to make renewed efforts to have the tragic situation in Burma addressed in suitable multilateral forums. In particular, I have instructed our Embassy in Sweden to talk to the Swedish Government about possible Australian co-sponsorship of some action in the United Nations General Assembly this year along the lines of that which the Swedish Government initiated last year. Regrettably, that initiative emerged too late to be effective then, but I believe-particularly given the enhanced authority and standing of the United Nations in light of events of the last 12 months-we should do what we can this year to use the forum of the General Assembly to focus the world's attention on the situation in Burma.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also asked our Embassy in Washington to discuss further with the United States State Department the possibility of implementing trade and economic sanctions such as those outlined in Senator Moynihan's 1990 Bill. The limitations on the effectiveness of trade sanctions in the face of possible non-adherence by some of Burma's most crucial trading partners may well be real, but I think that we should examine afresh, with other like-minded countries, what the prospects may be. I will also be reiterating, finally, to like-minded governments that we would support action for the imposition of an arms embargo on Burma and, in that context, I believe we should seek the support of Burma's regional neighbours, including China, Singapore and Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA> Classically, this is a situation where our influence is limited-we have to acknowledge that-and where the organisation of concerted and united international action is also not easy. But I believe we must keep on trying. The accounts of continuing complacency and repression on the part of the military authorities in Burma do make it important that countries like Australia make their views crystal clear and do what we can to mobilise international opinion. Maintaining pressure is an encouragement to the many very decent Burmese who are suffering and who are looking to the international community for support and succour.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 May Senator Harradine asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question about youth unemployment measures and the current unemployment situation. I seek leave to have the answer incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA>In seasonally adjusted terms in April 1991, the unemployment rate rose to 9.9% from 9.2% in March, and the number of unemployed rose by 66,900 to 844,000. Among 15-19 year olds seeking full-time work the unemployment rate rose to 27.0% from 25.8 in March. In non-seasonally adjusted terms, the total unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds was 22.9% in March. The participation rate rose to 63.7% from 63.2% in March. For males it rose to 75.4% from 74.9% and for females it rose to 52.3% (from 51.7%).</PARA>
<PARA>The current unemployment situation is a consequence of several factors, including the slowdown in economic activity in Australia and in the major world economies, depressed market conditions affecting many rural industries and reform and restructuring of the Australian economy. To a substantial degree, the current high level of unemployment is also a consequence of historically high labour force participation.</PARA>
<PARA>The youth labour market is typically the hardest hit in an economic downturn. The active labour market programs this Government has in place, together with new initiatives announced in the March Economic Statement, ensure that education, training and employment opportunities are available for young people.</PARA>
<PARA>At a time of recession it is particularly important that we maintain opportunities for young women and men to develop skills through apprenticeships and traineeships. In the March Economic Statement we announced the provision of an additional $16 million over three years for measures to keep apprentices and trainees in employment or to help them continue training while unemployed. Extra pre-vocational training places will be provided at TAFE colleges at a cost of around $59 million to help young people prepare for work in skilled occupations.</PARA>
<PARA>Other measures announced in the March 12 Statement that will also assist young people include enhancements to the employment access program including increasing the duration and value of assistance available under the JOBSTART wage subsidy, thereby improving the effectiveness of the program in assisting the unemployed; the expansion of the SkillShare program by $31 million over the next three financial years to address increased demand and to create 21 new outreach services including six for Aboriginals in remote communities; and early intervention for the unemployed with literacy and numeracy problems at a cost of around $20 million over three years.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, some 8000 of the long term unemployed will benefit from up to six months training and work experience on projects of community benefit while in receipt of a training wage, at a cost of around $40 million in each of the next two financial years. This includes provision of $5.4 million announced in the 1990-91 budget for work experience. The Training and Skills Initiative (TASK) will assist firms to retain employees in danger of retrenchment or who are working short-time and provide them with training in industry-related or basic workplace skills at a cost of $15 million in 1991-92 and $25 million in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA>Higher rates of education retention mean that those entering the workforce are now better educated and trained. The apparent retention rate was 64% in 1990, compared with 36% when we first came to office in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA>We have also recognised the special plight of young people in rural areas by providing additional funding of $15 million over three years to boost rural school retention.</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment should start to fall after the economy begins to recover later this year. The Government will adopt a long term focus in addressing the unemployment problem. It is important to protect the skill base of the workforce during a recession and to ensure that government programs assist sustainable recovery and job creation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information for Senator O'Chee which he requested during Question Time. The company concerned requested, in December 1989, that the Commonwealth bring forward half of a scheduled payment of $1.062m due for payment on 1 July 1990. The company requested this on the basis that it had some short term cash flow problems which were said to be related to cost overruns, delays in completing the retooling of the mill and wet weather, which had apparently delayed the processing of adequate volumes of logs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That request was referred to Price Waterhouse and, in correspondence from it on 22 and 28 December, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories was advised to proceed with the payment, but to reduce it with a discount for interest forgone from that December through to July. That is why the final payment was $986,841-which I referred to yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 May Senator Coulter asked me a question concerning gemfish and orange roughy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has supplied me with an answer. It is a rather long answer and I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Scientific advice earlier this year was that there had been a significant decline in recruitment to the east coast gemfish fishery over the last two years and that the catch levels should be substantially reduced to allow recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>The decline in recruitment was not expected and the reasons for this situation are not clear. Scientists will continue to monitor the fishery and catches will be set at levels which should facilitate a recovery of the stocks.</PARA>
<PARA>Gemfish catches recorded in 1989 and 1990 were 2037 and approximately 1300 tonnes respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of boats that had fished for gemfish in the past have been fishing for orange roughy in recent years. This has been primarily an economic decision by the fishermen concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>A total allowable catch of 24000 tonnes of orange roughy was set for the period May to December 1990 in the southern and eastern zones of the fishery adjacent to Tasmania. On the basis of the most recent scientific advice, this has been reduced to 21400 tonnes for the whole of 1991. Unless additional resources are found, current intentions are that this be reduced to a long term TAC of less than 6000 tonnes per annum by 1993. Scientific advice is that these catch levels should be sustainable in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has a firm commitment to manage Australia's fisheries resources on a sustainable basis. The Fisheries Act requires that in administering the legislation a major objective is to ensure that stocks are not over-exploited. In addition, the Government policy statement on the management of fisheries in the 1990's states a clear objective of ensuring the biological sustainability of the resource.</PARA>
<PARA>In this regard the preferred management strategy is to allocate individual quotas to fishermen based on scientific assessments of the long term sustainable levels for the relevant fish stocks. This arrangement will be put in place in the South East Trawl fishery later this year.</PARA>
<PARA>Research on Australian fisheries is an ongoing process and management arrangements, including total allowable catches, will be adjusted over time in light of the scientific assessments of stock levels to achieve maximum sustainable returns from fisheries resources.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) has been publishing statements in relation to approved nursing homes visited by Commonwealth officers since July 1990. The statements published by the Minister include an assessment of the nursing home's compliance with the 31 standards as outlined in the document entitled Living in a Nursing Home: Outcome Standards for Australian Nursing Homes. The assessment of the standards in the nursing homes is completed by the Department of Community Services and Health standards monitoring teams. When the report is completed it is forwarded to the nursing home proprietor for comment. From these comments the Minister will decide either to amend the report or to publish the report unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is distributed to the nursing home proprietor and the Director of Nursing, staff representatives, residents of the home, the State health department, and is also made available to the public through the Department's State offices. It is also made available in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library and I will refer to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all of us here would agree that the concept of monitoring standards in our nursing homes is commendable and I would certainly not argue with it. But if the statements on nursing homes are available to the public, it is important that they are correct as the nursing homes are to be judged by these reports. I have received a number of interesting comments about the operations of the standards monitoring teams and the accuracy of the reports from nursing homes in my State, the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, a comment was made to me that the first visit by the team was being made in a very friendly fashion. Points raised regarding unmet standards were very understandable. However, the second visit by the standards monitoring team was not always conducted with the same attitude. Claims of unmet standards were being made by the teams where there was clearly no drop in standards from the time of the first visit-so points that were not made on the first visit were made on the second visit. A number of nursing homes feel that they have been treated rather harshly during the second visit. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised by a group of directors of nursing, who have been through two standard visits, that reports are not being written strictly in accordance with compliance interviews. There is an example of one nursing home which had been picked up on one of the safety standards. Apparently, one resident did not have accessibility to a bell. The compliance interview identified this single patient. This patient was in fact a mobile resident who, I am told, was mobile enough to have access to a bell. When the final report was published it claimed that this safety standard had not been met. It is claimed by the nursing home that the wording of the report-and I must tell the Senate that I have not seen these reports, and I will turn to that in a moment-indicates that the problem did not relate to one patient, but to a number. </PARA>
<PARA> If I were a relative looking to read these reports in order to decide whether someone would go to a nursing home, I may be misled and believe that this nursing home was failing to meet the standard in general when, in fact, it was only one incident relating to one individual. This is clearly unacceptable. As I have already said, members of the public who have access to the statements may decide against having a relative admitted to a nursing home on the basis of the statement. If the statements are incorrect or misleading then they quickly lose their usefulness. I think all of us would agree-and I am sure the nursing home proprietors and directors of nursing would agree-that the very thing we want to do is maintain standards in nursing homes and publish the findings correctly. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing of concern to me-and it may just involve a timing factor since this is the first time that these reports have been listed-is that it says in the explanatory memorandum that a copy of each published report is also forwarded to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library. A very quick inquiry to the Library today failed to find these reports. This might involve a timing factor, as I said, but I ask the Library to ensure that it does make these readily available and accessible to members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I also call on the Minister and the Department to notify House of Representatives members and senators, but particularly House of Representatives members, about reports on standards of nursing homes in their electorates and advise them that they have been made so that members of parliament can access them in the Library and find out for themselves details about these nursing homes. The more publicity we can have, as long as these reports are accurate, and the more knowledge that both senators and members of the House of Representatives can have, the more useful we can be to people who are in the difficult situation of having to find residential care for their friends and relatives. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has ridden on the sheep's back for years. Over time, the wool industry has provided so much of our export earnings. It is indeed Australia's greatest earner of export dollars. Some 99 per cent of Australian wool is Australian owned and 97 per cent is exported-or it was, until the troubles of recent years. Wool has always helped Australia to pay its way yet today, in Australia, wool has become so expendable that, daily, we read of farmers who have to shoot their flocks because it is not profitable to ship these worthless animals to market. As one newspaper headline read, `$1.80 will buy you one beer or 18 sheep'. That is a very sad state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry faces a very difficult time. Production is dramatically ahead of demand so, naturally, we are witnessing an ever increasing stockpile problem. With that, there are rapidly increasing taxes to finance the purchase and storage of those stockpiles. How dreadful it is that this once great industry has been reduced to such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> This corrigendum to the Australian Wool Corporation Annual Report 1989-90, which we are now discussing, corrects an entry in that report under the heading `Inventories'. That section deals with the immense wool stockpile and its maintenance. As I told the Senate last year in a number of debates on this issue, nowhere had it been demonstrated-as distinct from asserted-that, were the offer price for Australian wool to be lowered, there would be any kind of direct and significant demand response. Further, and more importantly, it had not been shown that any such response would ensure that gross income for the industry would increase, or even be maintained. Our current growing wool stockpile, I regret, is testament to those predictions. </PARA>
<PARA> For 20 years the Australian wool industry benefited from unprecedented price stability, yet the Government decided to intervene, purely because it was unhappy that money was not going into the Treasury coffers quickly enough to cover the enormous balance of payments deficit that had been created. During the two World Wars, Britain bought the whole Australian wool clip under generous conditions. It knew that it could not depend on Australia's military support if it allowed financial disaster to befall an industry vital to our balance of payments and economic growth. Times have changed and Australia has 4.8 million bales of wool stockpiled, the Australian Wool Corporation has a $3 billion debt, and there is no war, I am happy to say. </PARA>
<PARA> The reserve price has been abandoned and a banker, Mr David Clarke, has been appointed Chairman of the new Wool Realisation Commission to sort out the mess. He is described as being brilliant with figures, and the future of all Australian woolgrowers lies in his calculations. His debt management skills will have to be worthy of the accolade given him by a finance magazine last year- `Banker of the year'. Mr Clarke has almost no connections with the bush or with wool growing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Council has, rightly, projected one of the Vines report recommendations on the wool stockpile, namely, the setting of a minimum trigger sale price, which would only succeed in limiting the extent to which prices could rise if the market recovered. It could also destabilise the market. In discussing this issue, the editorial in today's Australian said:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Kerin, believes the stockpile problem can be overcome in five years, Mr Clarke has been given seven. He could burn the stockpile or selectively destroy it as each bale, given a nominal value of $1,000, costs $200 a year in storage charges. He could offer it all on the market at no fixed price or sell it as `cowboy bonds', with investors buying shares and selling in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> One suggestion is for measured amounts of the stockpile to be sold to special, large wool manufacturers. The bulk would be offered to China and Taiwan. Other schemes have been suggested including the creation of a wool bank and the establishment of an options market similar to the gold trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever solutions he finds, Mr Clarke's job is to `sell off the assets-presumably in a way that doesn't disrupt things-and by so doing clear the debt'. The master of the `big numbers', he has a formidable task, but the future of one of our most important industries depends on his success. </PARA>
<PARA>These are some of the important things that we should remember as we consider this corrigendum to the Australian Wool Corporation Annual Report 1989-90. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the corrigendum to the Australian Wool Corporation Annual Report 1989-90, it is worth noting that it refers to the reserve price scheme. Of course, we know that the reserve price scheme has finished. But we are left with a total of close to 5,000,000 bales of wool in the stockpile and with a very substantial debt, which will bear down on the wool industry over the years to come. I listened to my colleague Senator Bjelke-Petersen giving an outline of some of the problems and the appointment of Mr David Clarke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I want to make in this debate concerns the importance of the management of what has been left behind and I refer, of course, to the disposal of the stockpile. It is absolutely crucial, if we are to avoid a situation where that stockpile bears down the market, that whatever decisions are made by Mr Clarke and the Government in terms of the handling of it, they must be visible and consistent in terms of release or, to use the current jargon, transparent. In the short time available to me in this debate, I want to emphasise the importance of this. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a survey involving 35 genuine woolgrowers who rely on wool for 80 per cent or 85 per cent of their total income. However, the cost of production in the area involved, that is, the Esperance area in Western Australia, is some 300c a kilo, greasy, which relates to about 450c a kilo, clean. In addition to that we have to add the proposed tax of 15 per cent. What we must realise about that 15 per cent tax is that it is a net figure and when it is grossed out it comes to somewhere between 22 per cent and 25 per cent. So, when taking that 450c, clean, as the cost of production, we have to add another 60c to 70c on top of that. So, in terms of the total cost required to break even without any improvements to the property, proper fertilising and proper conservation practices, and all those things that go with it, we are looking at a break-even price of somewhere around 515c or 520c. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise, in terms of the matter that we have before us, the importance of the management of the wool stockpile. It cannot be allowed to bear down on the market. Fortunately, since the reserve price scheme was dropped the recovery has indeed been remarkable; far better than most commentators and most industry leaders predicted. In fact, the price was sitting at 570c as of yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that I want to make here in terms of that is the transparency of the release of that stockpile so that the trade knows what is going on. The industry was bedevilled with uncertainty from about August last year when the debate started on the 870c price. That price went down to 700c. The 700c was rock solid and it was revoked and the world lost confidence in the ability of Australia to be a reliable, consistent provider of a product at a consistent price. That brings me to the last point that I want to make here when we look at that particular price. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely essential that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) reconsider his position as far as the 15 per cent tax is concerned. There are mechanisms-with the management of the Australian flock, with the management of the assets and with the management of the promotion-by which that tax can be significantly lowered. The lowering of that tax will have an enormous impact on the social cost which will occur through this restructuring process. I particularly refer to demands on rural reconstruction, on social securities and on State governments. It is absolutely imperative that a reanalysis be done of the proposals that have been put publicly in order to get that tax down to more like 8 to 10 per cent. It can be achieved if the effort is made, but if it is not, I fear that we could see up to 30 per cent of woolgrowers disappear from this country in the next two years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about the Australian Wool Corporation's annual report. I know that we have had a lot of discussion in the past month or so on wool, but it is not out of the question to reinforce what has been going on in the industry. Both the wheat and wool industries in Australia are in strife, one of its own volition and the other because of foreign markets, the export enhancement program in America and the subsidisation in the European Community. That is the great difference: one industry led itself into this downfall and the other was led into it by world trends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as wheat is concerned, Australia is trying to get some fair competition going overseas. As to wool-and I am a woolgrower-I must point out that the greed and arrogance of the industry led it into this situation. Woolgrowers wanted to pay themselves too much for a fibre that was not in demand as much as it used to be worldwide. Woolgrowers were simply borrowing more to keep themselves at a standard of living that they just could not afford at this stage. They should have seen the writing on the wall much sooner than they did. They were simply borrowing money and, unfortunately, a lot of that was going through the Treasury in higher taxation and that need not have been the case. Anyway, that has been done now. It is to the credit of the Vines report that, hopefully, we are now on our way to restructuring the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before in this chamber that I believe that no-one will make money out of wool for five years. Unfortunately, along the way there will be some tragedies as some growers go out of existence. That is the tragedy that came not from the present situation, but from what led up to it; it should never have happened. At least the restructuring is on its way. As Senator Crane pointed out, the prices are a little better than we expected. This week the clean wool price reached about 580c or thereabouts a kilogram. As Senator Crane also pointed out, the cost of production is that high. At least if the cost of production is that high, growers might be able to get themselves in balance until better times come in five years. </PARA>
<PARA> I also commend the authorities for some of the appointments they have made to the Wool Realisation Commission. The appointments will no doubt have to be ratified by legislation in the Parliament a bit later. I like the type of people and the integrity of the people who have been appointed to the Commission. I slightly disagree with a previous speaker, Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who criticised the appointment of a former banker, David Clarke, saying that he had no experience in the wool industry. As far as realising the stockpile is concerned, I believe that he is the sort of person that we want; he has no axe to grind. We need a person who will simply apply business principles to that realisation. It is not much different from liquidating a big enterprise except that there is only one line of stock to sell. I believe that a person like David Clarke and the other people who have been appointed will see the industry back on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA> The only aspect on which I disagree with the Government is on the wool tax we will be paying. I believe that the Opposition has a far better scheme by which the stockpile would disappear earlier. We would be charging a lower wool tax, therefore enabling more growers to survive until better times. Indeed, the Vines report recommendation on how to conduct the realisation would have been superior to what the Government intends to take on board. Legislation for that will be coming forward in a later session of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report deals with the operations of the Committee from July 1989 to June 1990. It describes the scrutiny by the Committee of the 1,258 instruments of delegated legislation which came before it. The Committee detected possible defects in 184 of these instruments, or some 15 per cent. The report gives details of the main concerns raised by the Committee. It also illustrates how the Committee obtains from Ministers undertakings to amend instruments to meet these concerns. The Committee is grateful for the cooperation it has received from Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is a convenient consolidation of the work of the Committee during the year. The Committee makes a detailed report to the Senate at the end of each sittings. Whenever it gives a protective notice of motion of disallowance in order to preserve its option to recommend further action, it incorporates in Hansard a statement of its concerns. Similarly, where a notice of disallowance is removed or otherwise dealt with, the Committee incorporates its correspondence. The present report now provides in a single volume a reference point for all aspects of the operation of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Delegated legislation is no less Commonwealth law than the Acts under which it is made. However, it is legislation which does not have the procedural safeguards and guarantees of a Bill which passes through Parliament. The Senate has therefore entrusted the Committee to oversee this legislation and to ensure, in its non-partisan fashion, that it complies with parliamentary proprieties and personal liberties. I believe that the report justifies the confidence of the Senate in the way the Committee improves the technical quality of delegated legislation. </PARA>

I would like to add to the remarks of the Chairman, Senator Giles, in two respects, and that is to take up the point she made that delegated legislation is just as binding, and sometimes just as harsh, as ordinary legislation.

It is an arduous job and it is very detailed. If the rights of individuals and the rights of this Parliament are to be protected, their diligence and attention to detail is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that concerns me greatly about the public knowledge of this Committee is that when I move around the schools in Victoria and I tell students that we can have three Liberal-National Party coalition and three Government members who sit and discuss issues that are a cut above party politics-issues about the rights of individuals and the rights of parliament-and that we can discuss these in a very rational and reasonable way, they are surprised since the images they get from the television and from the Press are ones of attack, counterattack and the political cut and thrust. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet here we see a Committee with a long and proud history-in fact a history since 1932, and I will be recommending that the Committee celebrates next year in 1992 a special anniversary-a history where a recommendation put to this chamber by that Committee has never been opposed or challenged by this chamber. That shows the regard in which that Committee and its various members since 1932 have been held. </PARA>

<PARA>ANNUAL REPORTING GUIDELINES FOR STATUTORY AUTHORITIES</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President</PARA>
<PARA>I present the 309th Report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts-Annual Reporting Guidelines for Statutory Authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee initiated this Inquiry into Annual Reporting Guidelines for Statutory Authorities in the context of, and in response to, the significant public sector reforms that occurred during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>The present Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities were issued in November 1982. However, since that time the guidelines have been neither up-dated nor re-reissued to reflect the major changes to the reporting requirements of all Commonwealth entities. </PARA>
<PARA>From the early days of the Inquiry, it has been abundantly clear to the Committee that the current 1982 guidelines are out of date and do not adequately reflect the changes that have taken place in both the present day administrative environment and the legislative framework within which Commonwealth government entities operate. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Committee's view, the annual report lies at the heart of the accountability process and is one of the most important vehicles for effective Parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>Statutory authorities have generally been afforded more management autonomy and flexibility in financial administration than departments of state. This is particularly the case in the light of the ongoing reforms to public sector management and since the issue of the Government's Policy Guidelines for Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises in October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>But this increased autonomy and flexibility give rise to an even greater need for detailed and proper reporting by statutory authorities of their performance to fulfil their accountability requirements to Parliament and through Parliament to the public at large. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Committee strongly endorses the existence of guidelines which lay the foundation for statutory authorities to prepare high quality annual reports that focus on the meaningful reporting of both financial and non-financial performance. Furthermore, the Committee is of the view that no statutory authority-large or small, commercial or budget-dependent-should be exempt from meeting the minimum requirements set down by annual reporting guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is particularly concerned that while many statutory authorities have specific annual reporting provisions in the Acts by which they are established and others are subject to the annual reporting provisions of the Audit Act 1901, there is no consistent or all embracing legislative requirement for every statutory authority to report to Parliament annually. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that there is no statutory backing for the annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities is incongruous with the existence of statutory backing for the departmental annual reporting guidelines, by virtue of the Public Service Act 1922, and the requirements of the Companies Code in relation to annual reporting by private sector companies. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Committee's view, the most effective way to ensure that there is a minimum level of quality information presented by all statutory authorities to Parliament each year is to give new annual reporting guidelines statutory backing and it has recommended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, in line with the current practice for the guidelines for departmental annual reports, the Committee has recommended that the statutory authority guidelines, and any amendments made to them from time to time, be approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has also recommended that new annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities be prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and that the Department be responsible for an annual review and up-date of the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a vast array of bodies that can be classified as statutory authorities and as part of the Inquiry the Committee closely examined the classes of statutory authorities to which the annual reporting guidelines should apply. The Committee has recommended that there should be one set of annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities and that these new guidelines should clearly state the categories of statutory authorities to which they apply. These categories should include:</PARA>
<PARA> * government business enterprises;</PARA>
<PARA> * statutory marketing authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> * other commercial statutory authorities; and</PARA>
<PARA> * non-commercial statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the Committee recommends that the guidelines should be presented on two levels:</PARA>
<PARA> * the first covering broad issues applicable to all authorities with an emphasis on accountability requirements for both financial and non-financial information; and</PARA>
<PARA> * the second level divided into sections relevant to particular categories of statutory authorities which outline the reporting requirements applicable to each category. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that these recommendations will clarify the present state of confusion surrounding the annual reporting requirements for statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>All statutory authorities are accountable to Parliament for their performance and, as I have already mentioned, the reporting of performance takes on added importance in the context of the recent reforms in public sector management. In the light of the reforms, the Committee has concluded that the current annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities do not adequately emphasise the importance of results-oriented reporting. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considers that currently there is inadequate guidance from central Commonwealth departments for production of performance information by agencies but readily recognises that development of quality information is a dynamic process and is still in its relative infancy. </PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, the Committee has recommended that all statutory authorities be required to report on non-financial performance in their annual reports, providing as a minimum, an outline of program objectives and of desired results together with a description of key performance indicators. Comparative data over successive years should be presented where relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>During the Inquiry, the Committee paid particular attention to the situation of statutory authorities with commercial operations. With the aim of improving the quality and timeliness of information to Parliament, the Committee has recommended that such authorities be required to present to the relevant Minister on a half-yearly basis, interim reports on financial position. Furthermore, all statutory authorities should be required to report critical events which have a material effect on financial position to relevant Ministers as they occur. In the formulation of the new annual reporting guidelines, the Committee has also recommended that stronger consideration be given to the treatment and disclosure in annual reports of commercially sensitive information. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary scrutiny of annual reports is an essential link in the accountability chain. Such scrutiny can have direct benefit in improving the accuracy of information provided in annual reports and in promoting adherence to annual reporting guidelines. The Committee also recognises a need for direct feedback to authorities from Parliament about the type of information presented in annual reports. Without such feedback, reporting entities are left in the dark about the quality of the information they have provided, how useful it is and how and where it could be expanded upon. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considers that a valuable form of Parliamentary scrutiny is that conducted by standing committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. As a result of a Senate resolution on 14 December 1989, the legislative and general purpose standing committees of the Senate now undertake systematic review of annual reports of all Commonwealth entities, although the Committee notes that the review process is somewhat uneven. The Committee also notes that scrutiny by the House of Representatives standing committees tends to be of a more ad hoc nature than that conducted by the Senate. The Government, however, has indicated its intention to implement a recommendation made in the Committee's Report 304 on Guidelines for Departmental Annual Reports that the House of Representatives standing committees formalise the scrutiny process. </PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, the Committee has made a number of specific recommendations to bring about enhanced scrutiny by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>In this Report 309, the Committee has endeavoured to set the major parameters for the drafting of new guidelines for annual reporting by statutory authorities. While the Report does not address all detailed issues in annual reporting, it identifies the critical matters that should be included in annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>This Report is seen by the Committee as providing the overdue impetus for new annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities. More importantly, the Committee views the Report as the foundation for the creation of relevant annual reporting guidelines within a framework of constant review and revision. </PARA>
<PARA>It remains for me to acknowledge the contribution of all members of the Public Accounts Committee to this Report, and particularly my fellow members of Sectional Committee B-the Chairman, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and Senators Giles and Reynolds. The honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) was also a member of Sectional Committee B until March this year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would like to thank the Australian National Audit Office for the secondment of Jenny Peachey to assist with this Inquiry. The Committee wishes to extend to Jenny Peachey its appreciation of her highly professional contribution to its work. Finally, the Committee records its appreciation of the valuable contributions of the Inquiry's administrative officer, Yolanda Campagna and of the Secretary to Sectional Committee B, Jennifer Blood. </PARA>

<PARA>JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON</PARA>
<PARA>MIGRATION REGULATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to present the Committee's second report, dealing with change of status on spouse/de facto spouse grounds. This report is part of the Committee's ongoing inquiry into the Migration Act and Regulations, as required by its terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA>Change of status from being a temporary resident to having permanent residency on the grounds of marriage or a de facto relationship has become more of an issue in recent years. Dramatically increased numbers of applications and allegations of fraudulent practices on the part of individuals and migration agents have heightened concerns that this means of remaining in Australia on a permanent basis is being abused. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee felt concerned about the increase in spouse applications because of the potential for abuse of the system. Applicants for change of status on spouse grounds are preferential applicants-they are given priority for assessment and they do not have to satisfy some aspects of the public interest test. It may also be said that the ability to change status from within Australia encourages people to do so in preference to their applying from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>The amended Migration Act and Regulations came into force on 19 December 1989. The legal regime established by that Act and regulations gave very little scope for visitors to change status on grounds of marriage or a de facto relationship. However, it became clear very quickly that the new law was extremely harsh and operated unjustly in many cases. On 15 February 1990 the previous Minister, Senator the Honourable Robert Ray, moved to institute a concessional arrangement for an interim period, whereby visitors here legally could apply to change status on grounds of a spouse relationship with an Australian citizen. At the same time the Minister referred the problem to a working party of the National Population Council for consideration and recommendation. The Working Party's recommendations were then referred to this committee for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Working Party recommended a return to the pre-December 1989 situation, that is that visitors should be permitted to be able to change status on the grounds of marriage or a de facto relationship, with added measures to reduce fraud. The committee, in November 1990, sent interim advice to the Minister, Gerry Hand MP, essentially concurring with the recommendations of the National Population Council, but recommending specific measures to reduce fraud and for the assessment of de facto relationships. The committee also argued strongly for victims of domestic violence to be given special consideration for permanent residency, even though their marriages may have broken down. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the committee's interim advice to the Minister the committee continued to investigate change of status and has made a number of conclusions and recommendations, principally in the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA> * collection and provision of statistical data;</PARA>
<PARA> * consideration of relevant cultural factors;</PARA>
<PARA> * marriage and immigration law;</PARA>
<PARA> * immigration marriage fraud;</PARA>
<PARA> * marriage breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee discusses at length the problem of immigration marriage fraud. The committee notes that marriage fraud is of particular concern for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> * the integrity of the immigration program is compromised when those who cannot qualify within the program secure permanent residence through a sham marriage;</PARA>
<PARA> * such sham marriages jeopardise the community goodwill which is necessary to sustain humane migration provisions facilitating family reunion;</PARA>
<PARA> * prevention and detection of marriage fraud is expensive in terms of staff and time resources. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee attempted to assess the extent of the problem by analysing the statistical data relating to change of status. However, this proved to be difficult, given the unavailability of much of the data and the paucity of data provided by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, especially in its annual reports to Parliament. The committee has commented particularly on this aspect of the inquiry in its report and has made several recommendations to rectify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the committee was unable to get a clear picture of the incidence of sham marriages, with much of the evidence being suggestive or based on departmental case officers experience. The committee has made recommendations in this area to ensure that the department collects and maintains a more effective data base. </PARA>
<PARA>The necessity for departmental officers to be made aware of the different cultural values and practices with regard to marriage is discussed in the report. Case studies discussed in the report illustrate the problems which can arise if officers responsible for assessing the validity of a relationship do not understand the relevant cultural factors. The committee has recommended in the report that assessment officers receive appropriate training in cultural considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>The marriage issue itself is an inherently difficult one. Moreover, the current legislative procedures in place to assess the validity or otherwise of a relationship for immigration purposes have complicated the task Departmental officers are required to perform. The Committee is especially concerned at the lack of guidance in the Procedures Advice Manuals relating to some areas of assessment, for example the test for a genuine marriage for immigration purposes. The Committee regards this issue as central to the question of marriage and immigration and discusses it at length in the report. As well as recommending and endorsing a number of changes to the law, the Committee has recommended that the Department provide more data in its annual report and more support for its staff in the form of training and better guidance in Procedures Advice Manuals. </PARA>
<PARA>In January 1991, in response to the Committee's interim report, the Minister announced a number of changes to the procedures for changing status. These included:</PARA>
<PARA> * increased evidentiary requirements through changes to documentary and interview procedures;</PARA>
<PARA> * a two year period of conditional residence for eligible spouse/de facto applicants with limited sponsorship rights and permission to work;</PARA>
<PARA> * a requirement that a de facto relationship be in existence for six months prior to date of application;</PARA>
<PARA> * increased application fees;</PARA>
<PARA> * provision for domestic violence victims to be granted permanent residence. </PARA>
<PARA>On 15 April this year the regulations were amended to put into effect the changes announced by the Minister in January. The committee welcomes the Minister's response to the recommendations made to him on this issue. However, the committee does have some reservations about the 15 April amendments, particularly the mandatory condition that there be no material change in the circumstances of the applicant during the period of validity of the visa. The committee has recommended that such material changes be confined to changes in the nature of the marriage or de facto relationship, such that the relationship is no longer genuine or continuing. </PARA>
<PARA>The regulations as a body continue to be a source of concern to the Committee, given their complexity and the frequency and number of changes being made. The Committee feels that such a degree of constant change to an already complex system without the simplification foreshadowed by the Minister in May 1990 disadvantages all those involved in the immigration process, including applicants, Departmental officers, community advisers and migration advisers. </PARA>
<PARA>All Committee members and staff have worked hard to finalise this report. The Chairman asked that I express particular gratitude for the advice and assistance given to the Committee in its endeavours by Dr Kathryn Cronin, the Committee's legal consultant. Dr Cronin's objective and intelligent advice has enabled the Committee to pursue its inquiries effectively and has without doubt enhanced the quality of the Committee's deliberations. I would also like to thank the members of the committee for the large amounts of time members devote to the work of this committee. It is a very demanding and sensitive subject area. My thanks must also go to the secretariat staff particularly our Secretary Robina Mills. I am also pleased to thank Ms Heidi Quinlan and to congratulate her and her spouse on the recent birth of their first child. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to all Honourable Senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations that has just been tabled has tackled the emotive and controversial issue of change of status on spouse-de facto grounds. I am pleased that this report prepared by that Committee has, in the main, had the support of all Committee members in its direction, unlike the first report. That is an indication of the extent to which the Committee was prepared to take evidence from around Australia and to grapple with what is and has been a complex and difficult issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has been part of the Committee's ongoing inquiry into the Migration Act and regulations as required by its terms of reference. Given the number of regulations that come out and the constant change, it is a particularly difficult and, of course, sensitive area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee met in most capital cities to hear evidence, evidence which indicated that we cannot ignore how much of a problem sham marriages undoubtedly are as a method of acquiring Australian residency. As our report on illegals last year indicated, while we see ourselves as living in difficult and uncomfortable times, we are still the lucky country to most of the rest of the world, with the result that we have a crush of people attempting to find ways around and through our migration regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Fraudulent marriages have been on the agenda in that regard of achieving life here in Australia. Yet despite this, we found during this investigation very haphazard methodology in the statistical records of such cases in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. This must be reorganised as a matter of priority so the Government, the Committee and its officers have immediate access to what is actually happening within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Disorganised data and, therefore, reliance on much anecdotal departmental evidence are not good foundations for changed regulations and legislation. Certainly the evidence we found of increasing and widespread rorts to the system was qualified by so many different people in each State that there was no reason to doubt it. But it is a lesson to the Department that statistical information cannot be treated as casually as it has been when the future of people's lives and the success of our migration regulations depends on decisions made from that information. Changing the format from report to report makes it extraordinarily difficult to get a common base on which to make value judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> That information is important, especially when everyone dealing with the situation on a daily basis knows that applicants for change of status on spouse grounds are preferential applicants. It can be a prime area of abuse. Surely, therefore, some constancy in collecting data on that area of immigration should have received high priority before now. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the evidence that we heard during public hearings was harrowing. We heard of women abused by their Australian husbands, yet too frightened to leave their marriage in case it also meant having to leave Australia. We heard of men conned by the women they married, deserted immediately when their wives achieved the prize of Australian residency. We did not hear many happy tales, because happy stories are success stories and therefore are not reportable or the basis of evidence. But stories of use and abuse and distrust and despair in the system were common. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as sad, we heard of men and women who were refused residency here because we take such a narrow view of what marriage is. The tyranny of distance, I suppose, strikes again. As Australians we generally believe that the marriage mould which fits our society is the old Anglo-Saxon one of choice and love. Yet we should be heeding the standards and customs of others who wish to join us within our true multicultural society. In making that judgment, if we are serious about being a multicultural society, we must take note of the views of those, and there are many, who believe that a happy marriage is between cousins many times removed who may never have met each other, or between persons born on the same day in neighbouring villages, or with someone 40 years older who for a variety of reasons participates in a marriage, or even with someone chosen by the family back home and sent to Australia for the marriage. They are cultural matters relating to particular societies that need to be taken into account when assessing these regulations within Australia. Those cultural backgrounds are important to the true integration of Australia as a multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not mean that we in any way dissipate the standards which we in Australia, and I in particular, support and encourage. It means recognising the rights of the cultural background of some people who would be applying for permanent residency in Australia. So the Committee in its report recognises and recommends that the immigration officers who are dealing with this complex range of world values on a daily basis must have workable, understandable guidelines to help them. They must have guidelines to enable them to recognise the fraudulent practices, yet guidelines that can help them accept in some instances the unusual as valid. We have no right to expect those officers to make the correct decisions for those couples if they are not armed with the information they need. In every aspect of this investigation the Committee members expressed concern not only at the lack of guidelines but also at the complexity of the migration regulations and the frequency and number of the changes being made. It is becoming a monster, there is no doubt about it, and it needs to be simplified. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) foreshadowed such a simplification in May 1990. A year later, unfortunately, things are much worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, as with the lack of guidelines, we are asking the front-line officers to shoulder a burden that is impossible as a base for correct decision making. In the middle are people, many trying to stay here fraudulently, and such complexities and changes can only help their cases to stay in Australia on a fraudulent basis. They are people who are rorting the system who ought not to be given assistance to do so. Others-some the victims, as we had in evidence before us, of quite dreadful domestic violence-deserve protection and compassion from some straightforward regulations. I trust and hope that the Department will heed this report, particularly as it relates to the area of statistical information, and that there will be a common format year in, year out so that appropriate value judgments can be made for setting regulations for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Investment Review Board annual report urges its readers to be very cautious about the statistical information contained in it-more cautious, I think, than previous Foreign Investment Review Board reports that I have read. Perhaps it is a reflection on the significant public concern that exists about the level of foreign investment which turns into foreign ownership by default. In this country a recent Bulletin poll indicated that 67 per cent of Australians thought that there was too much Japanese investment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The total expected investment associated with foreign investment proposals approved by the Government in 1989-90 was $24.1 billion, about 25 per cent less than in the previous year. The number of proposals considered was 2,913 compared with 5,163 in the previous year. Most of the total expected investment was in real estate, $10.5 billion; followed by tourism, $3.9 billion; manufacturing, $3.1 billion; mining, $2.7 billion; and services other than tourism, $2.7 billion. The main locations for expected real estate investment were my State of Queensland, $4.3 billion, and New South Wales, $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The rejection rate for proposals was 2.3 per cent compared with 1.7 per cent in 1988-89. Of the 61 rejected proposals, 57 were in the real estate sector, one in the tourism industry, one in manufacturing and two in the resource processing sector. As people will probably be aware, Japan was the largest source country for expected investment, accounting for 35 per cent of the total expected investment for the year compared with 28 per cent for the previous year. The main feature of Japanese investment was its concentration in real estate and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> Under current policy for off-the-plan arrangements, foreign interests may receive approval to buy up to 50 per cent of the units or condominiums in new residential development projects provided the dwellings are bought before or during construction, or following completion, but prior to being first occupied or used. I think this obviously begs the question: why do we allow this sort of arrangement? It is totally speculative in nature. Who gains from this arrangement? I believe the effect of this is to cause values in the area to rise and to make accommodation even less affordable for the majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's foreign investment policy has also had a major impact and a negative impact in rural Australia. There were eight proposals for the establishment or acquisition of interests in abattoirs and 15 rural property proposals involving total expected consideration of $250m. This may seem insignificant, but this fact takes little notice of the amount of vertical integration which exists in the beef cattle industry in this country, and the purchase by the United States food giant Con Agra of a 50 per cent share in Australian meat holdings takes away majority Australian control of the beef cattle industry in Queensland. This is a disgrace and it is no wonder that the Cattle Council of Australia has called for a restructuring of the Foreign Investment Review Board to give it greater visibility and accountability. I support its call. In fact, the Australian Democrats have been proposing such changes for some considerable time. </PARA>

What is the criterion for working out the needs of the community? In my opinion the vague qualification of `not contrary to the national interest' is not enough. It is not in the national interest to use foreign investment as a short term solution to our economic problems.</PARA></TALK.START>

In doing so, I think I come to the report from a position very different from that of Senator Kernot. I detect very strongly in Senator Kernot's remarks, despite some comments that might indicate otherwise, that essentially-I hope I do not misrepresent her-she is more anti, rather than pro, foreign investment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On our terms. I think that if we adopt that approach, we would not have had the foreign investment in Australia that we have had throughout most of our history. We would not have had anything like the living standards and the growth and the development of this nation that we have had. Nevertheless, there are aspects of foreign investment in Australia that require careful attention and monitoring, and attitudes taken towards them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that Senator Kernot made one remark which is, in fact, not correct. If I got her right, she said that more and more of Australia is falling into foreign hands. That is not, in fact, the case. If Senator Kernot looks at page 28 of the report and at the table which follows, she will find that the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>In the past decade or so, there appears to have been no major change in the levels of foreign ownership of Australian industries and resources that have been the subject of ABS studies.</PARA>
<PARA>Some of those studies are several years old. There has been a considerable reduction in the amount of surveying done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in this area of foreign ownership of assets in Australia. I think that is something that needs to be looked at. Nevertheless, the fact is that, according to the Foreign Investment Review Board and the statistics that are available, there has been no major change in the overall level of foreign ownership in Australia as a proportion of the total Australian economy over many years. </PARA>
<PARA> The report does make some very interesting reading in other areas, particularly the statistics. It highlights the extent to which the policies of this Government have led to such a massive increase in the total level Australia's foreign debt. Although it does not go back to the first year of the Hawke Government in 1983, the report starts with figures from 30 June 1984, which show that at that date Australia's level of external debt was 15 1/2 per cent of total gross domestic product (GDP). By 30 June 1990, that figure had increased to no less than a staggering 33 1/3 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> It is precisely for those reasons that we have the enormous debt servicing burden that we do have today and, therefore, the essence of our external account problem. All the reasons for that enormous growth in debt in Australia can be sheeted home fairly and squarely to the Hawke Government's policies, which have seen the level of external debt rise from $44 billion in 1984. I think that when the Government came into office it was of the order of $20 billion. That has now risen to a staggering $150 billion or so throughout that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Government adopts policies that will really tackle in a meaningful way that foreign debt problem, and it is showing no inclination of doing that, the problems facing this nation will become increasingly intractable. I commend the material contained in the report of the Foreign Investment Review Board. I hope that someone may speak to it subsequently. I think it is something that should be kept on the Notice Paper so that we can consider it in more detail later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the Foreign Investment Review Board Annual Report 1989-90, particularly regarding its relationship with the Australian Heritage Commission. I was under the impression that the Australian Heritage Commission Act required all governmental bodies to take cognisance of that Act in making determinations and that nothing any Minister, who has control over Commonwealth bodies, should allow to be done should in any way impinge on those sites, buildings or areas that are protected under the Heritage Commission Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I raise this in the context of the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) is that because of a court case, and only because of a court case, the people of Australia became aware of the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Keating), as the Minister with responsibility for the Foreign Investment Review Board, totally ignored the requirements of the Australian Heritage Commission Act in the matter of Paddy's Market in Sydney. In fact, the Treasurer just ignored the requirements of the Act-thumbed his nose at it-without reporting in any way to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that we expect that sort of arrogance from the Treasurer, and we certainly got it again in this case. Foreign exchange approval was given to a foreign-based development without the requirements of the Heritage Commission Act being met or, in other words, every effort being made to ensure there were no suitable alternative methods of handling this matter. These requirements were just ignored by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised this matter during the Senate Estimates Committee hearing. I will deal with it at greater length when the matter of Estimates Committee C comes before this chamber. I hope that by then I will have been able to establish some facts. The Australian Council of National Trusts wrote a letter to the Government, that is, both the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Treasurer, expressing concern that the Department of the Treasury had not fully met its obligations under the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Was the Commonwealth bound by the Act, at least in terms of the Foreign Investment Review Board?</PARA>
<PARA> This important matter should be resolved. Is the FIRB, as a governmental body, bound by the Heritage Act? If not, why not? What does the Government intend to do to ensure that bodies such as the FIRB, when allowing foreign investment to take place-the situation that clearly obtained in the Paddy's Market matter was recently resolved in the courts-take note of the Heritage Commission? Otherwise, the Government's alleged commitment to preserving Australia's heritage is clearly hollow, and its hollowness was evidenced in the court case. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who is on duty and who I know is concerned about heritage matters, takes this matter up with his Government to ensure that this body is bound by the Commonwealth's legislation, which is supposed to relate to and control the Commonwealth's activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My first concern in addressing the annual report 1989-90 of the Foreign Investment Review Board is that the guidelines in respect of foreign investment are far from clear. My other concern is that the Foreign Investment Review Board seems to be toothless. Ultimately, the decisions are made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his own capricious way. From what I can tell, George Pooley, who is head of the finance and investment division of the Department of the Treasury, really seems to run the show subject to the Treasurer's approval.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not so long ago in Sydney a proposal was put up by I think the Pivot Group Ltd and an overseas group. The Treasurer declined it I think for aesthetic purposes. He did not approve of the development. I think he thought that it was contrary to his perception of how the Sydney skyline should look. If that is the nature of the decisions, it really gives no guidance to anybody trying to make a judgment as to whether the project is likely to get approval. Of course, an enormous amount of effort and cost goes into the preparation of these submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have guidelines-I think they were referred to by one of the Australian Democrats-in respect of residential property, particularly condominiums. Foreign investors can own 50 per cent off the plan of any given project. I was fascinated with the number of golf courses being built in northern Queensland. I wondered what was unique about the Queensland climate that it attracted so many golfers and what attracted so many condominiums to the golf clubs? I quickly discovered that it was the cheapness and the access of playing golf in Australia for the Japanese. That is a very attractive component of any development. The golf course is really there as a sweetener for the condominiums. </PARA>
<PARA> How does the Government decide that 50 per cent is a good number, that 40 per cent is a good number and that 60 per cent is a bad number? It is an arbitrary figure that does not have any intrinsic intellectual assessment attached to it. Perhaps it is driven more by the xenophobic nature of Australians. Perhaps it is driven by the fact that two years ago real estate prices were skyrocketing, particularly in Sydney but in Australia generally, so the Government had to make a political statement. People were convinced that they could not afford to buy a home because all the Japanese were flooding into Australia and buying up all the homes. That was what was driving prices up. The Government seemed to be making a political statement. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very real need to get proper and clear guidelines that are intellectually sustainable, of course, measured and mixed with the natural, but not necessarily healthy, concern of Australians about the flood of Japanese money coming into Australia. They have essentially gone into real estate-besides the attraction of the golf courses-because of Australia's taxation system and its high levels of inflation and therefore the escalating value of non-productive assets in the form of bricks and mortar. That is why the Japanese have been investing in real estate. One might describe some of the rural sectors of Australia as real estate areas. This money is not going into manufacturing or other areas. It is simply Australia's economic environment that attracts investment into that area. It is not that the Japanese have any quirk or quaint notion about real estate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final report of the Resource Assessment Commission entitled Kakadu Conservation Zone Inquiry is before us because of this Government's incompetence and failing, and its incapacity to make the right and honest decisions-in fact, when the crunch comes, as it did before the last election, to make any decision at all. I suspect that Senator Richardson thought that, having convinced Cabinet to put off the inevitable day, after the election things would go nicely and that Justice Stewart and his body, the Resource Assessment Commission, would agree to the mining of Coronation Hill which could then proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know the history of the conservation zone. It makes up part of stage 3 of Kakadu National Park. We also know that Senator Gareth Evans, when he was the Minister for Resources, described a very significant part of the third stage as `clapped out buffalo country'. I do not say that that is true of all stage 3; there are some very beautiful parts of it. But there are also hundreds of thousands of acres of country which I would not have thought, by any reasonable measure, would be unique or particularly attractive. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, when stage 3 was set aside for the park and there was a proposal that it be nominated for World Heritage listing, Senator Evans very sensibly tried to rescue what he could of that very rich resource potential of the Northern Territory. He looked around to see what part he could set aside into a conservation zone for future mining. At that stage, it was pretty obvious to the Government that, for political reasons relating to its internal politics, no more uranium mines would get off the ground. So Senator Evans found himself looking at resources other than uranium. He selected for his conservation zone mineralisation, which was essentially related to gold, platinum, palladium and such exotic minerals and metals. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans imagined-and it was proposed and announced-that there would be research and exploration of conservation areas in stage 3 and that those areas in due course would be set aside and allowed to be mined. Coronation Hill was one of them. It is no coincidence that Coronation Hill is in the conservation zone; the conservation zone was drawn so that Coronation Hill was in it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the decision had to be made, the politics hotted up and the Government made a judgment that the last election would be very much decided by minority groups, particularly the conservation movement. Therefore, the tenet of its faith was that there would be no mining in stage 3. Senator Richardson had to find some excuse for not mining Coronation Hill. The environmental impact statement had been prepared and presented and it was approved by the Government. There was no logical reason why mining at Coronation Hill should not proceed, but there were political implications. </PARA>
<PARA> We ended up with the establishment of the Resource Assessment Commission. It essentially reported that there was no practical or tangible reason why mining could not proceed. Its report was really just a very expensive rerun of the environmental impact statement which had previously been prepared. In the process of his inquiries, Justice Stewart and his commission came to the conclusion that the Jawoyn people would object to mining. We ended up with a report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) on the Kakadu Conservation Zone, which is the next document I see listed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report brings me to the next stage of the saga. Justice Stewart drew the breathtaking conclusion that the Jawoyn people were opposed to mining in the conservation zone and at Coronation Hill. I say with respect that that flies in the face of the best evidence thus far obtained from the responsible elders of the Jawoyn people. My own view-a view which is supported by evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts-is that the Northern Territory Sacred Sites Authority and other groups sought and successfully influenced the outcome of the determination of the Jawoyn people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not without significance to note that this new found sickness country, the born again Bula boundaries, actually changed twice in a matter of months. When that was pointed out by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd to the Northern Territory Sacred Sites Authority, it simply changed the boundaries. If these boundaries are prepared and drawn on the basis of the views of Aboriginal custodians, one has to ponder as to how the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority, when trapped and caught fiddling the boundaries, could arbitrarily change them again without the authority of, or consultations with, the Aboriginal custodians. </PARA>
<PARA> This area has already been subjected to the Jawoyn Katherine area land claim, which was heard by Justice Kearney. He came to the unqualified conclusion that sites 4 and 5 failed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the traditional evidence put forward in relation to Areas 4 and 5 is insufficient to enable any finding to be made that the members of that group (or any group, for that matter) are the traditional Aboriginal owners of those areas, within the meaning of the Act. While there are sites on both areas and Dreamings to which the Jawoyn have links-</PARA>
<PARA>and he then gives those examples-</PARA>
<PARA>the existence of common spiritual affiliations to sites on Areas 4 and 5, or to sites which can be linked with those areas, is not established; nor is there evidence of a strong traditional attachment to Areas 4 and 5. Accordingly, the claim to Areas 4 and 5 fails. </PARA>
<PARA>Claims 4 and 5 are those areas that are very close to Coronation Hill. It is not without significance to note that the Resource Assessment Commission, in seeking expert evidence, used Dr Merlan. Dr Merlan was the person who identified the alleged sacred sites in the first place, registered them on the part of the Aboriginal community and then consulted for the Northern Territory Sacred Sites Authority to examine whether they ought to be registered. In other words, he was a bit like Laurie Connell-the honest broker for both parties, the Aboriginal community and the Sacred Sites Authority. Of course the sites were bound to be registered. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding that, the Jawoyn people made it quite clear to Justice Kearney that, in their view, it was not country in which they had any interest. When an area nearby-for instance, the Eva Valley area, which would have to be considered Jawoyn country if Coronation Hill country was-was referred to, they said, `We have nothing to do with them fellows. That is another group. Forget that. We only want Jawoyn country.'. We now find that Justice Stewart claims that the Jawoyn people believe that it is their country. When giving evidence before the Senate Committee, the responsible custodians made it quite clear in unequivocal terms that, in their view, Coronation Hill ought to be mined. They had no objections. It was not sacred site country, it was not sickness country and it did not impinge in any way upon their traditions or beliefs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in this debate to express concern about the prospect of this Government making a decision based on the Report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on the Kakadu Conservation Zone which clearly is unsatisfactory in some elements. If mining is to be prohibited on the grounds that it would offend Aboriginal belief, the manner in which the report has concluded this, does not, to my mind, stand up to any kind of clear test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report entitled The Significance Of Shallow Traditions by Mr Ron Brunton, an anthropologist and head of the environmental policy unit of the Institute of Public Affairs, clearly indicates some major areas of concern about the quality of the report on which the Government will be making this decision. In particular, The Significance Of Shallow Traditions points out that there is a real prospect that `illegitimate pressures', to use its description, have been put on some of the Jawoyn people when they were giving evidence before the inquiry. As the report says, at one stage Justice Stewart obviously believed that the question of pressures from anti-mining individuals and groups had to be addressed because, at the hearing at Barunga on 6 March 1991, he asked each of the custodians whether they had been subjected to any such pressures. The custodians said no. However, the question was asked in the presence of some of the very people who may have been applying the pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> This might explain some of the extraordinary conclusions that were made. For example, Mr W. J. Fisher had been in charge of mining Coronation Hill in the past, the so-called sickness country, which, under present claims from some Jawoyns, would prove a disaster if it was mined. This man had working for him a large number of Jawoyns. He provided information along these lines to the inquiry. Justice Stewart clearly did not consider his evidence to be significant. Mr Fisher demonstrated that Coronation Hill itself is not the area of the sickness country that it is held out to be in the report and that this sickness country is 30 kilometres away. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had major expressions of concern about the location of the mine, but we have clear evidence that Jawoyns were prepared to work on the old Coronation Hill mine site. I stress this again: this area has been worked in the past by the very Aboriginal people who are today claiming that it has magically become a sacred site. As Dr Brunton concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>But now the Government is being advised to protect areas on the basis of beliefs which the RAC Inquiry has acknowledged are only a decade old. (While the beliefs about specific sites in the Zone are older, the justifications for protecting the whole Zone are not.) The change from tens of thousands of years to ten years is quite a trajectory, and it could have the gravest implications for public acceptance of the need to protect sacred sites. The obvious question is whether there is any part of Australia that could not be protected under the Act, should anyone set their minds to it. Perhaps the most worthwhile thing to come out of the Inquiry will be the realisation that the definitions of Aboriginal tradition in existing legislation need to be completely rethought. </PARA>
<PARA>I do believe that there is a case for protecting and preserving the true sickness site and supporting sites, as identified by Mr Bill Arndt in 1955-which do not include Coronation Hill; it is 30 kilometres away-but it looks like the Jawoyns have the wrong site. Mr Justice Stewart did not even discuss this matter in his report, as raised by Mr Peter Fisher. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words on the report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) on the Kakadu Conservation Zone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Tate casts his mind back to that time, he will remember that that was the sort of decision that the Government could not make, pending the election. It decided to have another inquiry to inquire into the last inquiry and into the inquiry before that. Sooner or later, after all these inquiries, the pigeons have to come home to roost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the millions of dollars that Pancontinental has sunk into that place, it wants to know whether it will get any return on its money by mining or whether it will have to close up forever. Unfortunately, if it closes up forever, it will probably close up its other prospects around Australia forever and, as reported in the press the other day, do its exploration, and maybe mining later on, in countries that appreciate it. That was the gist of that report. It was commissioned to get the Government past the election. Now, 12 months past the election, the decision still has to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Coronation Hill has known reserves of 1.1 million ounces of gold. That deposit would result in a $500m profit and would employ 600 men. Of course, a lot of those would be Jawoyn people. Probably contrary to Senator Tate, I visited that place twice when I was on an inquiry. They told you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as they told us, that they were very interested in getting jobs, so that their colleagues could get away from some of the social pressures existing at the time and resulting from being unemployed, such as alcoholism. Added to that-and I know that I have said this before-I have never known of a mine, starting up on the basis of reserves found on exploration, not to find an extension of that lode. </PARA>

Nearly 100 years after extensions are still being found. In my own home town an extension of the original lode, discovered in 1888, was found. There are more reserves to be found.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this brief period that I have to address this subject, I will mention what worries me. As Senator Michael Baume pointed out a minute ago, this is a precedent. All of these conditions, reasons, excuses or red herrings that are being applied to Coronation Hill can be applied to anywhere else in Australia, whether in the Nullarbor, the eastern gulf, the west coast of Tasmania or in the conservation zone of Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> If an environmental group can get its way on this matter it can apply the same criteria to everywhere else. There are moveable sacred sites. We have found that out over the years, for example, when a new mineral reserve has been found or when at various times the Department of Main Roads in Western Australia has wanted to put a highway through. It worries me that Coronation Hill will create a precedent if the Government does not have the gumption to say, `Right, this project is going ahead'. </PARA>
<PARA> That precedent could be used around Australia time and time again. We will be closing down the resources that we badly have to get moving in order to get Australia out of the recession-not the recession, but the depression-and to get us on the road to prosperity again and to get rid of some of the unemployment. For those reasons, I call on the government to get the project moving. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

This could be a useful indication as to which departments are, in fact, efficient and which are inefficient. I am hopeful that that will be taken up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I want to address my remarks particularly to that matter listed as a request for act of grace payment for unused recreation leave and leave bonuses on retirement for the Commissioner of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, because here is a very good example of the correct use of an Advance to the Minister for Finance, pursuant to section 34a of the Audit Act.</PARA>
<PARA> I raised the question of the proper functioning of section 34a of the Audit Act in asking a question of Senator Evans fairly recently. I asked him how he was going to make the payment to Mr Brian Burke-as he had stated he was going to do, as it was a resignation-when the Department of Finance in Estimates hearings had answered that it would be most reluctant to exercise its act of grace payment power and to make such a payment to Mr Burke. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans replied to me that he believed that it was a payment which was made pursuant to the powers that the Governor-General conferred on him in making the terms and conditions. He later told Senator Hill that he was relying on section (n) of that agreement, and then he told us again at the beginning of this week that he had changed his mind again. He had yet again another legal opinion, and it was now going to be pursuant to section 2a (2), the termination power of the terms and conditions agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I still contend that the proper way in which any payment would be made, unless he is sacked pursuant to section 2a (2) should be an Advance to the Minister for Finance in the form as we presently have before us in respect of former Commissioner Caesar. I am driven to ask myself the question: why has the Government put itself through the contortions that it has in trying to find ways to pay Mr Brian Burke money? Why has it gone through the agonies of saying, `He has given notice of his resignation; no, he is going to resign straight away; no, he is going to be sacked; no, he is not going to be sacked', and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The only answer I can come up with-aside from the fact that, if his appointment is terminated under the agreement, the Government will pay to bring him, his family and his goods and chattels home-is that I suspect it has more to do with the way the payment will be treated for taxation purposes. If the payment of $28,000 had been made in the way it was first outlined, it would have been treated as an ordinary employment payment and, as such, taxed at the highest marginal rate of 48.25 per cent. That would have meant a tax bill on that $28,000 of $13,510. But if his appointment is terminated within the terms of the agreement-most people would understand termination to be sacking but the Government wants to have it both ways-it would be treated as an eligible termination payment and as such it would attract the lesser rate of 31.25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> A termination payment for Mr Burke would result not in a gain of just the $7,000 by going from $28,000 to $35,000 but a tax gain of nearly another $3,000. In other words, by changing the arrangements under which the payment is to be made, former ambassador Brian Burke will receive a net gain of nearly $10,000. When we look at the correct way in which an Advance to the Minister for Finance is dealt with in the papers before us and at the contortions that the Government has put itself through, we can only conclude that the driving force has been to give him yet another benefit, this time under the taxation requirements-an advantageous rate at which he will pay tax. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to address my remarks on this occasion to the payment of $11m sought by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce in respect of the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981. In May 1990 when an amendment to that Act was debated in this place the explanatory memorandum under the heading `Financial impact statement' contained a statement that the anticipated dollar values on a financial year basis for the anticipated payments pursuant to this bounty for the year 1990-91 would be $85.96m. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, when we go to Budget Paper No. 2, the Commonwealth Public Account, at page 46 and look at the appropriation made in respect of that Act, we see it as a sum of $63,000,829. I wonder why it is that the appropriation was less than the sum which was forecast in the explanatory memorandum. Then we find that there is an application for a further $11m, which presumably means that the appropriated sum of $63m has run out. The application is for an advance under division 868, paragraph (c), of Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> I put on record that I would like some answers as to why the sum that was finally appropriated was less than the sum prognosticated in the explanatory memorandum, and I would like to know to whom the $11m is in fact paid. There was some concern at the time of debating the amendment to the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill that the amounts paid by way of capitalisation could create the capital by which an enterprise could be acquired. We were simply assured that that would not be the case. In looking at this application under section 32 of the Audit Act, I place on notice that I will be seeking answers to those questions in the correct forum. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the figures simply do not seem to make sense in terms of what the Government had said it would do and what it in fact has done. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is the peak medical research body in Australia, which was founded in 1936 together with the Medical Research Endowment Fund from which money is appropriated for medical research in Australia. The Council is a type of sorting body for these funds. In 1990-91 over $95m has been appropriated for allocation around the country. The National Health and Medical Research Council has been an outstanding success over all these years in the way in which it approaches this dispensation of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Council has some critics. It has 30 members, including representatives from each of the State health departments and, in addition, representatives of the Public Health Research and Development Committee and the Medical Research Ethics Committee; nominees of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, the Australian Council of Social Service and the Australian Academy of Science; and the First Assistant Secretary of the Health Research and Services Division of the Department of Community Services and Health. Of those 30 members all are academics or bureaucrats. There are no practising medical practitioners or nurses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) has been approached in this regard and has refused to include a nominee of either the Royal Australian Nursing Federation or the Australian Medical Association. It is as a result of not having anybody who actually treats a patient on that Council that we have the absurd situation where a subcommittee of the NHMRC recommended that a four-year training course be established in acupuncture. This recommendation has gone forward but has not yet been acted upon. At the same time, we have an excess number of medical practitioners in the country. We already have two bodies within the medical profession whose members are trained in acupuncture and available to treat patients, yet the NHMRC is recommending that yet another a four-year course be established in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In Brisbane there is already a college called the Australian College of Natural Medicine which has training courses in acupuncture. We have two separate bodies within the medical profession whose members are trained in acupuncture and the Australian College of Natural Medicine conducts training courses, yet we have the NHMRC recommending that further courses be established in one specific entity. Before long we will have courses in iridology, quackmancery or other things being established if some stop is not put to this. Membership of the NHMRC should also be open to people who actually treat sick people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report is an interesting document. As my colleague Senator Kernot has outlined before, the rejection rate for all applications that the Foreign Investment Review Board is dealing with is very low. It is only 2.3 per cent and almost all of those applications included real estate. It means that we are selling our farms and our businesses at an increasing rate. In fact, it is not putting it too strongly to say that the low rejection rate confirms that the Board and the Government are interested only in, basically, rubber stamping foreign investment proposals. I do not believe that is a course of action which is in the best interests of the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the preliminary December quarter of 1990, foreign investment statistics showed that the total level of foreign investment in Australia, as at 31 December 1990, was $264.3 billion. The gross foreign investment in Australia during 1989-90 was $21.2 billion. From these figures we can extrapolate an increasing rate of foreign investment. I believe it is time that the community and the Government took action to ensure that whatever foreign investment occurs in Australia is actually carried out in the interests of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the Foreign Investment Review Board is an interesting one. On 1 April 1976 the then Treasurer, the late Hon. Phillip Lynch, made a statement on foreign investment to the House of Representatives. As well as spelling out the Government's sector of foreign investment policies, the then Treasurer announced the creation of the Foreign Investment Review Board. The Board was subsequently established on 8 April 1976. In the same statement Mr Lynch said:</PARA>
<PARA>Initially we will establish the Board by administrative action. It is proposed that it be given a statutory basis as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Fifteen years later the Board is still without statutory backing. The Australian Democrats believe that the current status of the Board and the foreign investment guidelines which it administers are totally inadequate. We believe that foreign investment may indeed be beneficial where funds cannot be raised in Australia, but it also causes obvious problems concerning the liability to fund profits and with decisions affecting Australians being made in the boardrooms of Tokyo, Berlin and New York. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to what we consider to be a totally unsatisfactory situation, we will be introducing legislation to create an independent foreign investment review commission. The functions of the commission will be: firstly, to make decisions on foreign investment proposals; and, secondly, to hold inquiries and make reports in respect of foreign investment proposals or on broader issues relating to foreign investment. In order to establish and maintain a register of foreign investment in Australia, it is absolutely essential that we know the current state of affairs on the extent to which we are owned by people overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> In determining whether investment proposals should proceed, the commission will have regard, firstly, to the sustainable development and growth of Australian industries that are efficient in their use of resources and that are self-reliant, enterprising, innovative and internationally competitive. Secondly, it will also have regard to the maximisation of Australian participation in the development and exploitation of Australian natural resources and in Australian industries generally. Thirdly, it will have regard to the maximisation of employment and harmonious industrial relations, the national and local environmental and cultural policies, the concentration of foreign ownership in the particular industries, and the interests of consumers and the community in general. In other words, before we approve foreign investment, the commission will be charged with a duty to assess whether, on the basis of all of these criteria, that particular investment is in the interests of the Australian community.

<PARA> (b) further notes that the employment of people under 21 years of age by the Australian Public Service (APS) has been halved in the past seven years, from 32.08 per cent of APS recruitment in 1983, to 12.92 per cent in 1990;</PARA>

<PARA> (i) 111 600 full-time youth jobs were wiped out over the 12 months to April 1991, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force figures,</PARA>

<PARA> (iii) this means that more than one in every four jobs for youth have been wiped out over the past year, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) these 111 600 lost jobs for youth make up 55 per cent of all the 204 400 full-time jobs lost in Australia, even though 15 to 19 year olds make up only five per cent of the employed full-time work force; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the Hawke Government for making young Australians the cannon fodder in the recession the Treasurer (Mr Keating) says we had to have and in the record unemployment we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate of 27 per cent for April 1991 is the highest April figure on record and is worse than the figure for any month during the Fraser Government, despite the Government's expensive schemes to hide the real level of unemployment among 15 to 19 year olds;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) agrees with the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seven years ago that the disastrous unemployment situation, particularly that facing young Australians, cannot and should not be tolerated as these levels of unemployment are the ones that `no Australian Government should ever be forgiven for creating'; and</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that more than 52 000 jobs were lost to the manufacturing industries in the year to February 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that this represents a decline of 4.3 per cent of manufacturing jobs;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) recognises that the Government's failure to implement reform in the areas of taxation, industrial relations and transport and communications has been instrumental in the loss of those jobs; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) calls on the Government to shake off the shackles of the ACTU and other vested interest groups and urgently introduce reforms which will help get Australia moving again. </PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that 856 300 Australians were unemployed in April 1991 as a direct result of the policies of the Labor Party at state and federal levels;</PARA>

<PARA> (c) notes the long-term effects on the savings and dreams of those whose lives are so disastrously being shattered; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) calls on the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to direct his full attention to the tragedy facing these Australians, rather than to the selfish and destructive pursuit of his leadership ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in Victoria has jumped by an incredible 120 per cent over the past 12 months, more than three times the 37.6 per cent rise in NSW,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the number of jobless in Victoria has more than doubled from 109 300 in 1990 to 237 400 in April 1991, three times the NSW rise,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the full-time youth unemployment rate in Victoria has almost doubled, from 14.6 per cent to 27.4 per cent over the 12 months to April 1991, to a rate far higher than the NSW rate of 22.5 per cent, which is the lowest of all states, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) all the Labor-governed states have seasonally adjusted unemployment rates higher than 10 per cent, while the Greiner Liberal State Government in NSW has Australia's lowest unemployment rate of 8.6 per cent; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) draws to the attention of the people of NSW the clear link between the `double whammy' of having a State and Federal Labor Government and double digit unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak particularly on those 12 notices of motion which relate to the appalling levels of unemployment in our country. The figures themselves are stark. The figures from the Commonwealth Employment Service-and I extract these from the relevant notices of motion-show that approximately 12.4 per cent of Australians are looking for employment; more than one million people are registered as unemployed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that some 844,000 people are now unemployed and of those some 40 per cent are women. My colleague Senator Newman tells me that if I looked at last month's figures I would see that 50 per cent of those unemployed were women. In addition, 63,800 people were officially discouraged, and that of course is why we have very high levels of hidden unemployment, despite a minor upward movement in the participation rate. There are still many thousands of people who have simply given up. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally-and this is the most important statistic of all in many ways-there is the level of unemployment benefits, which is currently some $616,000; an extra 19,400 people having become recipients of that benefit in the last month. In Victoria alone, over the preceding 12 months the number of people in receipt of unemployment benefits has risen by some 120,000. On the youth unemployment front the figures are similarly shocking. The national level is 27 per cent. In the manufacturing sector 52,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the year to February. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures, each in themselves devastating, will have a cumulative effect which will inevitably sink this Labor Government. I simply refer to the headline which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald the other day when Max Walsh got it right-as he so often does-which stated, `The dole queues, not WA Inc, mark Labor for defeat'. I think it is particularly important for all those people who relied on this Government when it came to office to go back and examine its record to see on what basis the Government was elected and whether it has delivered the goods. One cannot do much better than start with a quotation, which Senator Bishop included in her notice of motion, from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seven years ago. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the disastrous unemployment situation,-</PARA>
<PARA>we should recall that the number of unemployed at that time was some 750,000 as compared with almost 850,000 now-</PARA>
<PARA>particularly that facing young Australians, cannot and should not be tolerated as these levels of unemployment are the ones that `no Australian government should ever be forgiven for creating'. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many devastating quotations and I will simply turn to several of them. Senator Richardson-Mr Fix-it if ever there was one-is someone to whom one simply says, `Deliver the green vote' and he will turn the politics of the issue green; ask for the grey vote and he will turn them grey. He no doubt almost took it for granted that he did not have to cultivate the traditional constituency-those in the Australian Labor Party and beyond who regarded the Labor Party as the Party which could deliver on what was regarded, above all, as the most important issue; the issue of jobs. On 25 May 1983, Senator Richardson said, in unequivocal terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The last election was won by the Australian Labor Party on the issue of unemployment. This Government will sink or swim on its performance in providing jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>On 5 October of the same year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> By March 1983 the Australian electorate had had enough. It clearly wanted and needed a new approach to economic policy. The Hawke Government has provided just that. We have rejected the policy of fighting inflation first, the one that never worked. </PARA>
<PARA>Tell that to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who has been desperately casting around. Then there is the Prime Minister who would now have us believe that this is really part of the grand strategy, that fighting inflation is what it is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, I accept that current acknowledgment from Senator McMullan. Of course, though, there is a lot more to it than that in terms of their position on unemployment. I think I quoted yesterday those immortal remarks of Senator Richardson, which will no doubt come back to haunt him:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might say that the Labor Government was elected primarily on the issue of unemployment. It recognises its responsibilities in this area and if it fails over the years to meet the problem of unemployment it will not be elected again, and it will not deserve to be. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we also realise how important employment is to all Australians. I can do no better than to quote from some recent remarks of the Catholic bishops on the occasion of the one-hundredth anniversary of the encyclical Rerum Novarum. What they said was this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . human society is built upon and around productive human work. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, they were quoting the words of Leo XIII some 100 years before, but those remarks remain as relevant today as they were then. That is why we all stress the primacy of employment, and it is why there is such an appalling tragedy attached to very high levels of unemployment. Again, I quote Senator Richardson, who said on 26 March 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Government fails to reduce significantly the unemployment rate for the young unemployed in particular, it really will have failed. This is our great challenge for our next term in office and, hopefully, it is the one on which we can embark as soon as possible . . . The first and most important one is the problem of youth unemployment-the ugliest, the most frustrating and the most frightening statistic to come from Australia's economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA>They are indeed devastating because these words illustrate, in all their starkness, what Labor regarded politics as being all about, what it believed its mandate was when it came to office, and what it believed it would stand or fall on in the intervening years. Of course, we now have the statistics. Labor is condemned not only for what came out of its own mouth but also for the essentially fraudulent and dishonest nature of the rationalisations that we have heard recently. It can never disguise the fact that simply it has not delivered. It cannot excuse its incompetence on the basis of having a drought, for example, nor do we have falling world commodity prices or a Halfpenny led wages break-out. It is indeed all its own work. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures encapsulated in the motions constitute the most devastating indictment of a Labor government, which has now forfeited all moral legitimacy. The litany of Federal incompetence, aided and abetted by State recklessness on an appalling scale, simply demonstrates that many in the Labor Party retain their commitment to outdated economic theology. In recent times we have heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) once again talking about solutions that would deviate dramatically from the doctrine espoused by the Treasurer over the past eight years. Instead of a floating exchange rate, Mr Dawkins would have us bring it down artificially and peg it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also had innumerable contributions from people wanting to make use of the assets and income of superannuation funds for socially desirable investment purposes. Also, of course, in recent days we have had Mr Bannon and others embracing further corporatist solutions. Quite clearly, job creation concepts are alive and well in the Labor Party. Very little seems to have been learnt in terms of proper economic management. That I think is the great tragedy of the statistics which will return to haunt this Labor Government and which will inevitably bring it to defeat at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no joy for the people of Australia to know that this Government has failed so comprehensively, to know that those figures are part of a nightmare that this Government could never have envisaged in its wildest dreams. But they are there for all to see: 180,000 long term unemployed, a phenomenon barely recognised a decade ago, and now we look like having a permanent underclass trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair, and this Government offers very little hope. </PARA>
<PARA> In bringing together all these motions, we have been able to demonstrate that, if ever there was a government that failed the acid test that it set for itself, it is this Government. It is hoist on its own petard in a way that no-one could ever have imagined, and it will undoubtedly pay the price with a decade in the wilderness. Mr Hawke's legacy will not only be a place in history as the longest serving Labor Prime Minister but also as the one who ultimately made Labor irrelevant in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Alston outlined, we are having a cognate debate on a series of motions, notice of which was given yesterday by a number of Opposition senators, concerning the serious unemployment situation in Australia. It is not surprising, I suppose, that we do not have an equally impressive array of motions before the Senate on the outstandingly good inflation figures that we saw yesterday. We continue to have the enthusiastic obsession of people trying to find every piece of bad news they can. That is not to underestimate the importance of unemployment. No-one in this Senate should, and certainly no-one on the Government side does. The Government is obliged to respond to the debate and Government members will be participating in it. Several of them have indicated that they are keen to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I want to make some general remarks about the employment situation and the policy context in which it is being dealt with by both the Government and the Opposition, and I shall make some references to aspects of some motions. Although I would like to have a chance to talk about them all in some detail, time does not permit. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a continuing situation in the area of unemployment-and I will refer to some others as I go through-where Opposition members want to have it both ways. They want to come into this place and make speeches about their grievous concerns about the unemployment situation and their heart-rending concern for the individuals who are so sorely affected, but they also want to be able to go round to the financial media and business and publicly talk about how tough their fiscal policy is going to be and how they are going to crack down on welfare-all the tough rhetoric that goes with the ideological obsessions that drive their leadership at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is nothing unusual about this seeking to have it both ways initiative. It is part of a broader pattern. For example, today Senator Tierney was bewailing the fact that a bit of enterprise bargaining was going on somewhere and, shock, horror, there had been a strike. This Government has been very successful in reducing the level of time lost through disputes in Australia, and that has made a substantial contribution towards increasing the productivity of our economy. The Opposition has underestimated how significant the reduction in strikes has been as a factor in improving productivity, because people are actually at work. The fact is that members opposite cannot come in here and maintain that they want enterprise bargaining but there should never be any strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policies, as has happened with the policy of the New Zealand Government, would tear the industrial relations environment of this place apart. That is one of the reasons why the Opposition will not get a chance to implement them. Senator Alston came in here at lunch time during the matters of public interest discussion and he said it was shocking for anybody to suggest that there was some element of heartlessness in the proposal to cut off people from unemployment benefits because they would all be able to get special benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Opposition cannot have it both ways. A person who I assume is a senior spokesperson on behalf of the Opposition in these matters said on a recent occasion that this policy would save $750m. It cannot save $750m and have nobody worse off. Those two things are not possible together. If the policy is to save $750m, it will mean that a lot of people who otherwise would have received benefits will no longer do so. This policy cannot save money and at the same time be at no cost to individuals. Members opposite want to have omelettes without breaking eggs. </PARA>
<PARA> They are saying that our attempts to manage the unemployment situation more effectively will not save enough money and will not be tough enough. They claim that they will save $750m. I am quoting from somebody who may or may not be an authoritative source, because these comments are made by Dr Hewson. Opposition members must stop him from engaging in this bad habit of blowing their arguments out of the water. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the situation again in this debate which is supposed to indicate a concern about unemployment. A certain senior Opposition spokesperson has said that the Opposition will take unemployment off the economic agenda. It will change the terms of reference of the Reserve Bank of Australia so that it is no longer concerned with the maintenance of full employment. That is going to be taken away from it; it will no longer be part of its charter. Its charter will deal exclusively with the question of inflation. At the moment, the Reserve Bank has a series of economic objectives in its charter, one of which is the maintenance of full employment. Employment is a proper consideration for the Reserve Bank at the moment, but under the charter proposed today, once again by Dr Hewson, we find that the maintenance of full employment goes off the agenda of economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members want to come in here and pretend that they are worried about unemployment, but they also want to be able to go out to the financial media and say that they will fight inflation first and that they will take full employment off the economic agenda; that it will no longer be a criterion upon which they want economic policy to be judged. During Question Time Senator Hill expressed concern about the fact that the one per cent cut in interest rates meant that real interest rates had gone up; yet we also have Dr Hewson saying that we should be maintaining our high interest rate policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In all these areas, those opposite think that they can come in here and advocate one thing in the hope that the public will get some false impression of how benign they are while they advocate the alternative policy in other forums. For a while, oppositions can get away with that. Having been a member of the Labor Party for a long time, I know a fair bit about being in opposition. Oppositions can get away with those sorts of things for a while, but over a period of time, the people start to ask them how they are going to make these contradictory remarks add up, and at the end of the day it cannot be done. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the inevitability that the Australian public, who cannot be underestimated-they are not bad judges; they have been pretty good four times in a row-will start to ask how these policy prescriptions of the Opposition will achieve the outcomes which it proposes when they are entirely contradictory. Concern is expressed in this place continually that the surplus is falling. It is ironic that a party that has never delivered a surplus should be here pontificating about the fact that this financial year it looks like the surplus will be only $1.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> If those opposite are proposing that the surplus should be anything like $8 billion in the middle of a recession, they are dispensing with one of the fundamental things that distinguishes a modern industrial economy from the economy of the 1930s-what is called in the jargon the `automatic stabilisers'. They are talking about trying to maintain the surplus by either increasing revenue or slashing expenditure. That is just a recipe to extend or deepen the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite talk about setting targets of zero to 2 per cent inflation, which none of the major Western economies have at this time-not one. Yet somehow they are going to achieve that. It is possible to achieve it, but only at the price of flattening the economy. If they try to achieve that objective simultaneously with introducing a broadly based consumption tax without any form of wages policy whatsoever, the only way to fight inflation in those circumstances is to flatten the economy further. </PARA>
<PARA> In all these areas those opposite cannot go on forever advocating contradictory policies. They come in here shedding crocodile tears about the unemployed, about a very real and profound social and economic problem in our society, while they go out elsewhere advocating policies that have exactly the opposite effect to that which they purport to be advocating here. They cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs. They cannot go on advocating these policies without the contradictions eventually being pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> Without taking up too much of the limited time available for this debate, I would like to talk about one very important part of Senator Tambling's motion. It may be an unintended consequence of the way in which Senator Tambling has drafted his motion; I hope so. I am particularly concerned about what I consider to be a very severe reflection on the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The motion seems to indicate a strong implication of criticism of the policy of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in excluding certain people from unemployment figures and in the way it measures unemployment. Without getting into the technicalities, the motion seems to carry a strong criticism of the legitimacy of the process by which the ABS raises its figures. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It actually has been attacked a few times in this place by the Opposition, but that is not my concern at the moment. I simply want to put a few comments about it on the record. A large number of comments could be made, but I will quote from an article in the Economist referring to a major study that had been done by the Royal Statistical Society about how Britain's records might be improved. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>How might Britain's record be improved? Look at the world's best official statisticians: Canada, followed closely by Australia, Sweden and Holland. These countries' systems are centralised with most numbers collected by a single body whose independence is guaranteed by law. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say that the Australian Bureau of Statistics is one of the best two national statistical bodies in the world. I want to talk about the reason the statistics are collected in the way they are in case the motion carries some unintended implication that there is something wrong with the ABS statistics or that they are being in some way manipulated. </PARA>
<PARA> The method of gathering unemployment figures by the Australian Bureau of Statistics conforms to international definitions of the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) which is convened by the International Labour Organisation. The definition originally dates from 1954 and was reviewed by the ICLS in 1982. This relates particularly to the question of people who work one hour or more per week. There was some reference, which was also raised in a question asked in the Senate earlier this week, about people who do unpaid work. </PARA>
<PARA> People who do unpaid voluntary work are not counted as employed except where they do unpaid work for more than one hour per week in a family business or farm but where the nature of their remuneration differs; that is, they are more likely to receive payment in kind than wages. This method of calculation also conforms with ILO definitions of employment. Through a series of resolutions there is reference to the fact that the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) figures are not used now but we use the ABS figures instead. For 15 years they have been considered the appropriate method of measuring unemployment, and they are all round the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, under a coalition government, the method of calculating unemployment figures was reviewed and in 1978 the decision was made not to use CES figures in the calculation, and unemployment data began to be issued monthly rather than quarterly. Sometimes the CES figures are under and sometimes they are over. So sometimes it might be in the Government's interest to put them out. </PARA>
<PARA> But overall they are not a true indication of underlying unemployment because people can be registered with the CES and they certainly have no obligation to, and do not necessarily, remove themselves from the register when work is found or they move interstate or whatever. It is not a priority of the CES at this time to keep those records precisely accurate. The obligation of the CES is to provide a service to the people who come in to see its officers, not to produce a second-best set of statistical records. That is what the ABS is there for. The priority of the CES is and should be otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Many unemployed people are not registered with the CES and the CES figures can vary for reasons not simply to do with the state of the labour market. Therefore, it is appropriate that we do not have a whole series of data coming out. The ABS is the accepted measure. There are other ways we could go about getting a second-best measure of inflation or a second-best measure of other economic statistics but we do not do that. When we find the one that works best we persist with it. No serious commentator that I am aware of suggests that the public debate about economic policy would in any way be enhanced by releasing a second-best set of statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go any further I want to comment on some proposals which I understand the Australian Democrats may be going to raise concerning amendments, and indicate that, to the extent they have indicated some proposal to delete various parts from the motions as proposed, they would not be surprised to know we agree with that part, and to the extent they are proposing to add words we do not agree with that part. That would be perhaps the least surprising bit of news Senator Powell has had all day but I give it to her for what it is worth. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give other people the chance to participate in this debate, although there are a number of things I would like to say about particular resolutions. But the most appropriate thing is to conclude, having made those general remarks and referred only to one matter that gave me cause for concern with regard to the Bureau of Statistics and its measurement, firstly, because I thought it may have been criticised and, secondly, because it seemed to reflect some understanding about the proper mechanism by which those figures should be recorded. </PARA>
<PARA> We really are being flooded with crocodile tears. As the policy of the Opposition is eked out the contradictions in it get shown up. We do have a very profound social problem in Australia with regard to unemployment. It is very profound for those individuals and it is a serious economic and social problem for the nation. But to come in here expressing concern about unemployment, while advocating policies that will make it worse and that would make the situation of those individuals affected by it worse is not a consistent and credible position in public policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Over time, as the predictions of independent economists and international observers correctly indicate, as Australia emerges from this recession, the Opposition will have to start making positive contributions to the economic debate in Australia instead of simply shedding these crocodile tears, and that is the test which it will fail. </PARA>

We are extremely concerned at the Government's policies and what they have achieved on the backs of the unemployed. What we reject utterly is the suggestion that we are trying to have it both ways. What we believe is the case is that the Government's policies have caused the problems that we are facing. It is the Government's attempt to use blunt instruments which have directly been the result of the high unemployment that we are facing.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our Leader is saying that we should have structural reform, Senator-structural reform, taxation reform; things which Senator McMullan does not have the guts to do, partly because of his close association with vested interest groups of one kind or another, particularly the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and he knows it. The Reserve Bank of Australia deserves to be independent too and it is not being proposed by our Leader as a separate item but as part of a whole process taken together with structural and taxation reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the dimension of the expression `the unemployed'. We have heard a lot from Senator McMullan but not much sympathy, and he was referring to Senator Tambling's motion and what he saw as implied criticism of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). He managed to use quite a bit of time talking about how marvellous the Bureau of Statistics is. But in point of fact Senator Tambling's motion casts no reflections on the Bureau of Statistics whatsoever. The reflection was on the Government, which since 1988 has found it convenient not to continue to publish the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) figures. That is the purpose of that motion and I draw the attention of the Senate to that. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McMullan" NAMEID="5I4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what it says.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is exactly what it says. It calls on the Government to come clean with the nation and reintroduce the publication of the CES figures, Senator. Let that be on the record straight away. We are concerned that we cannot get a handle on the problem because we cannot work out what the figures really are. We know that there were 616,300 Australians in receipt of unemployment benefits in April, and that excludes those whose spouse is employed. Those are the unemployment benefit figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then we know also that there are 856,300 Australians who show up in the ABS as unemployed and that excludes those who have worked for an hour of paid or unpaid work. We also know, through unpublished figures but released on freedom of information to the Melbourne Age, that the CES says that there are 1,054,102 unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the CES figures are for those who are registered for work. It does not include those who are not registered because there are no jobs available or those who do not register because they have no entitlement to unemployment benefit because they have a working spouse and, therefore, the CES figures in fact could be considerably more than they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Goodness knows, but whatever they are, they are appalling figures, and it does not do to have Senator McMullan come in here and pontificate about how the figures are collected. The awful thing is that they are there to be collected.</PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about the unemployment of women and, therefore, the motion which I moved related to the 300,000-odd women who are unemployed. In the previous month it was 308,100. It has gone up in this week's figures to 352,500. Some 44,400 women have gone on to the unemployed lists, the official unemployed lists, in the past month. Whatever else one says, that is an awful thing for those individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be something Senator McMullan is trying to explain away but at least some people on this side of the Parliament are concerned about it. I think it is highly offensive that a Minister of the Crown would come in here and say that this debate is about the crocodile tears of the Opposition. In fact that reveals the lack of concern by the Government in my view. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it, the Commonwealth is not even a shining example when it comes to employing women. It is not making it very easy for women, apart from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which seems to be leading the push to be an all women organisation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is being severely criticised by women for not giving women jobs in that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at Comcar. We have had an answer to a question on notice recently in an Estimates committee that only 6.5 per cent of the Comcar drivers are women. It has just put on another 62 drivers. How many women did Comcar put on? It put on four. So much for giving women job opportunities. Less than 10 per cent of the new applicants who have been successful have been women, so the Government should get its own house in order. </PARA>
<PARA> This week, the Government has disbanded the Women's Bureau in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. That Bureau was established by the Menzies Government 20-odd years ago to do research and policy development on the employment of women. At a time when we have 352,500 women officially unemployed that unit has been disbanded. Some concern this Government seems to have for unemployment and women! Senators Bolkus and Evans, whose departments I have just referred to, should be ashamed of themselves. What will happen to policy development and research on women's employment? What will happen to research into the high rate of unemployment among women and the need for training programs, and the most appropriate training programs, now that the Women's Bureau is no longer? It has slunk out of the Federal scene with not a mention from the Minister responsible-not an official tear from the feminists in the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that figures that were published earlier this year said that child-care difficulties were cited by 194,400 women as the reason they could not work, although they wanted to do so. The Australian Bureau of Statistics back in September last year found that there were then half a million women who wanted to work and were actively looking for work but were not able to start work. In addition, there are now 47,200 women who are discouraged from looking, for good reasons-because they believe they will be considered either too young or too old, or considered as unsuitable because of language or ethnic difficulties, or lack of the necessary skills or experience, or because there are no jobs available at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In March, 30,300 Australian women gave up looking for work altogether. Let us not forget that women do not show up very well in the unemployment figures. In the March figures, although 308,100 women were shown as officially unemployed, only half of them received unemployment benefit. What a great saving to the nation, although many had been taxpayers for years and had contributed to the funds that were available to meet the needs of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of employment and the loss of employment are leading to terrible pain and fear among women. First is the problem of keeping a roof over their heads, with high repayments. Despite the gradual reduction in high interest rates, those repayments are still a heavy burden. It should not be forgotten that that is still on the heads of all Australians. It came to particularly dramatic notice back in March when the Preterm Foundation in Surrey Hills in New South Wales announced that it had a 31 per cent increase among married women coming to it asking for abortions because they could not afford to lose their jobs and leave employment if they remained pregnant. That announcement was followed up by similar announcements from abortion clinics in both Melbourne and Adelaide. That is what is happening to women in this country. They are having to choose between having a baby and staying in employment, because the employment situation is so difficult and they are so vulnerable. Doctors tell us that it is leading to increasing physical and stress problems.</PARA>
<PARA> What is particularly worrying is the high percentage of young women who are unemployed. Back in March the proportion of unemployed females in the 15- to 19-year-old age group was 26.8 per cent. Nearly one-third of our young women under 19 cannot get a job. There have been reports of tertiary students who cannot get part time work to keep them going through their studies going into prostitution in order to continue their courses. The Australian Council of Social Service announced just recently that it expects one-quarter of a million Australian children to be living on unemployment benefits by the middle of this year. So much for the children of Australia! So much for the Prime Minister and his hollow promise about children living in poverty! It is this Government's policies which have directly put those children into those areas of poverty and strain on their families. These are the fruits of the Treasurer's labour. These are the lovely numbers he brags about. It is his policies that have caused the anguish. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, Australia needs policies of structural and taxation reform, it needs an independent Reserve Bank, and it needs a consistent monetary policy. By comparison, the Treasurer's policies have been cruel and unintelligent. They have led to shocking hardship and a waste of the national resources through high unemployment. The Opposition believes that Australian women particularly are the unwilling victims of a Labor Treasurer and his policies, and that is why the Opposition calls on the Treasurer to resign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In taking part in this debate I refer to the motion moved on my behalf today which points to the deplorable figure of 856,300 Australians who were unemployed in April 1991. The second part of my motion recognises the anguish and worry of those who cannot find work, whether they be school leavers, parents with dependants or older people who have been made redundant. I shall refer to those matters later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the only good news this Government has had for as long as I can remember is the 0.2 per cent inflation figure for the March quarter. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has taken much pride in this-even Senator McMullan today has been talking about it-and there has been much backslapping in the media and everywhere else. But it does not take away from the point that the biggest worry that is now facing this country is unemployment. In April 1990, a little over a year ago, there were 534,200 Australians unemployed and, in April, 1991 856,000 Australians were looking for work. Therefore, in the last 12 months this Government through its policies-this recession that we had to have, the one that was engineered-has engineered 322,000 Australians onto the unemployment scrap heap. That figure has increased by 60.3 per cent in one year. It is a record that no government would ever be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA> Involved in that is the sad and tremendous figure for youth unemployment. As a member of my very honourable colleague Senator Michael Baume's task force on young Australians, I am very concerned to find that in the last 12 months there has been a rise of 29,600 in the number of young people put out of work-a rise of 35 per cent. The number of young Australians in work has fallen by 11,600 in the last 12 months. The figure that I quoted earlier-the 856,000, or a 60.3 per cent increase in one year-is the biggest rise ever recorded in Australia over a 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> I take no joy in seeing that my State of Tasmania has an unemployment rate of 10.8 per cent-double digit unemployment, something that was never going to happen. That is an increase of 28.8 per cent over 12 months. We now have the dubious honour of having the second highest unemployment rate in Australia. </PARA>

There is no doubt that the figure of 856,000 which I quoted, created a new record for unemployment. This broke the old record of 770,000 which was set a month before. As my colleague Senator Newman pointed out earlier, March of this year saw 1 1/2 million people registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as looking for work. This does not include the hidden unemployed, whom my colleague Senator Baume refers to from time to time-all those people who have given up hope of looking for work, those who have been pensioned off by the Government, or those who have been reduced to part time employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noticed today in my local paper a very sad article on homelessness amongst Tasmanian children. I agree that a lot of those are under the age for employment. The sad fact of the matter is that in my own State the Department of Community Services and Health is quoted as having to turn those children away because it does not have the resources to cope with the homeless youth in Tasmania. Mr Les Whittle who is involved with the youth care program run by Anglicare Tasmania Inc. said:</PARA>
<PARA>They say ``don't refer any more to us because we can't do anything''. </PARA>
<PARA>What do we do when a 12-year old lives in a shelter with 24-year olds? Do the people in charge of the shelter wait until the boy gets bashed up and go back to the Department and say, `Can you do something now'? It is very unacceptable. Anglicare has said that last year between 120 and 130 people were coming to it for the first time and that another 250 others were coming back. Of those, 30 per cent were under 16 years of age. What hope do those young people who are homeless have? What hope will they have of getting jobs with unemployment the way it is?</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, Senator McMullan, who is just leaving the chamber, talked about the drop in interest rates and this month's wonderful figure for inflation. I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and to the Senate that the interest rate drop we had today and the further predicted interest rate drops are too late for many thousands of Australian families. What use is a reduction in interest rates if people do not have a job to enable them to pay off their family homes? What comfort will a drop in interest rates be to families who have had their homes repossessed? What use will a drop in interest rates be to the hundreds of thousands of small and large businesses which have had to close their doors and lay off their staff?</PARA>
<PARA> As a member of Senator Michael Baume's task force, I have spent some time going around talking to young unemployed people and viewing the efforts made under the Skillshare program and the Jobtrain program, and by the youth shelters in northern Tasmania and in north-western Tasmania. I have identified 111 groups of people in Tasmania, which has a population of only 450,000 people, who are trying to do something to help young unemployed people. Even with all the will and the good intentions in the world, there is no coordination or very little coordination between any of them. They are paddling their own canoes. The church-based groups are doing one thing and the Skillshare groups are trying to do another. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to note that the Skillshare groups and the Jobtrain groups have people queuing up trying to get into these training schemes to do something to get re-employed. What happens once people have been through these training schemes? The sad fact is that they come out into the community where there are no job vacancies. They sit around for a while. The motivation that some of these programs have given them has only built up their hopes to be dashed again when they go out into the cruel hard world of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the homeless youth shelters are seeing the effects of unemployment. They are also seeing the effects of some very clever young people who are using the shelters as a means of touring around Australia. People have told me of their concerns, some of which worry me. One parent in Launceston telephoned me and told me that his son had actually been encouraged by other young people to antagonise them into hitting him so that he could leave home and get a better allowance under the scheme relating to homeless youth. These are the results of this Government's policies and the unemployment. I just despair for the young people in our community at the moment. We can all rejoice about the inflation figure, but there is very little joy in what is happening to the unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish primarily to concentrate on the question of economic management, its relationship with unemployment, and to look at the question of the ethos that prevails in particular countries and try to make some comparison between those that have been successful and those that are currently in recession. I do not think anyone in this chamber does not know that unemployment is both a personal and a national tragedy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia at the moment we are experiencing, in common with a number of other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, a high level of unemployment which is absolutely and utterly unacceptable. All of us are aware of the personal tragedy that involves. All of us fear the question of a build-up of unemployment in this country which ultimately can lead to certain areas literally becoming long term unemployment pockets that will never change. In Australia we have not reached the situation yet where, for example, in the United Kingdom whole regions have been deeply in recession with dramatically high unemployment figures for more than 20 years. That has not yet happened in Australia. It is a matter of some concern to all of us on the Government side, and I believe also to the Opposition, that that possibility is cut out before it becomes a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously when in Opposition, parties look for simple solutions. Primarily parties which are in opposition have to try to show that the Government is incompetent and hard-hearted, and has inadequate policies to deal with particular issues in front of it. Those parties in opposition obviously have to offer some very simplistic solutions which can be understood by the electorate at large. Of course, the difference is that if the members of an opposition actually believe in those simplistic solutions and hope that they will be the answer, they are not only deluding themselves when they ultimately get into government, as they will one day, but they will also be deluding the electorate and doing damage to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I go through some of these issues I might just mention those areas where I believe the Opposition is deluding itself by putting all its eggs in one basket, believing that there are certain policies which will be the answer for Australia's problems. All of us know that Australia has deep structural problems which go back to the 1950s, when we had the opportunity to make decisions and when we could afford to make decisions but slept on behind the protection of high tariff barriers, behind the protection of quotas on imports, and behind the protection of a solid and artificially constrained Australian dollar-or pound as it was in those days. In fact, sooner or later Australia had to come out of its lucky country syndrome, out of its dreamtime. As a government we are now having to deal with that legacy of absolute inactivity-I might say intellectual inactivity, as well-on the part of governments of those days, particularly the Menzies Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As everyone in this place knows, the Menzies Government was a very comfortable, conservative government which made Australians feel good. That is why it got re-elected, with the exception of the 1961 election when it came close to being defeated. Bob Menzies was a past master at making people feel good about themselves and at making sure that Australians relaxed. It was a time when on the whole Australians accepted the status quo and, if ever they were internationalists, were only internationalists in so far as they were interested in test cricket matches between ourselves and England. We had no interest at all in South East Asia at a time when we should have been moving into those markets. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, we had very little interest in the Common Market. Many Australians were dramatically surprised when Britain, for example, entered the Common Market. Suddenly, Australians were faced with the notion that they did not have a favoured relationship with Great Britain any more. In the early 1960s we then decided that we had to look to other markets such as South East Asia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be history, but this is the point: Senator Tambling lives in a State where history is very important. He talks about the Aboriginal people and the importance of history to them. But like half the politicians on his side-and like all populous politicians-he is always looking for the simple solution. He thinks that history is about four or five years. The simple fact is that our economic structure was not created yesterday or during the Malcolm Fraser era; it was created much earlier than that. The decisions that were made should have been made back in the 1950s, at least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us get back to the current situation. There is a large measure of dissimilarity between the way that governments of the OECD countries approach the management of their economies. Let us look at the Keating legacy. A number of people would know that in some ways I disagree with some of the policies of Paul Keating; I do not hide that. Anyone who says that he believes in everything his political party does ought to have his head read, or it must be the most wonderful political party in the world that can incorporate everybody's interests and viewpoints to the extent that everyone can therefore agree unanimously to every policy in that party. </PARA>
<PARA> Paul Keating created an ethos of entrepreneurialism; people thought more about economics and economic literacy was required as a prerequisite for most politicians and journalists. He created a situation in which people started to see themselves as part of a world economy rather than just a regional or national economy. He opened the doors and said, `Let's have competition in this country so that our industries, our entrepreneurs, can start to see themselves as part of a world economy'. Sure, that was a rough and ready approach but it had to be done in a rough and ready way because we did not have any option. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, if we had started to see ourselves as part of a world economy in the 1950s we would not have needed to do it in such a rough and brutal way during the period of this Government. But it was done, and the Treasurer, Mr Keating, must be given credit for dragging Australia in to the 1990s. It will be an uncomfortable process. Some of the finetuning of those policy decisions will sometimes be wrong. It is a question of whether they are able to be fine tuned in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the countries I mentioned before. Let us look outside ourselves and try to get some perspective on matters relating to economic management. Let us take five countries-the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, the United States of America and Australia-the ones that have the greatest similarity in terms of demography, cultural history and, to some extent, economic history. Let us look at the stark figures and make a comparison of unemployment in 1990. It is interesting. Unemployment in the United Kingdom was 6.9 per cent; in New Zealand, 7.7 per cent; in Canada, 8.1 per cent; in the United States, 5.4 per cent; and in Australia, 6.9 per cent. The Australian level is below that of New Zealand and Canada and about the same as that of the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at inflation: the United Kingdom, 8.9 per cent; Canada, 6.2 per cent; the United States, 5.3 per cent; and Australia, 4.9 per cent. I believe that we can validly compare the performance of these countries on two fronts-control of inflation and unemployment statistics. The United Kingdom-the country which in the last decade has most clearly put into effect the policies advocated by the Opposition-has an inflation figure of 8.9 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the United Kingdom. It has an inflation rate of 8.9 per cent, with a 6.9 per cent unemployment level. So Australia's inflation is half that of the United Kingdom. Our unemployment is about the same. Here we are, sitting on the other side of the world, with no ready access to markets the size of the Common Market, and with markets as far away as Japan, the United States and of course Europe. Australia has no peculiar advantages that might be held by the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One looks at those stark figures and wonders how the United Kingdom can perform so badly when it has followed all the policy prescriptions pushed by the Opposition. It has privatised whatever it could, it has sold off the family jewels; it has this magic consumption tax that the Opposition talks about; and it has gone for policies, across the board, which would be absolutely acceptable to the Opposition. Yet it has an inflation rate of 8.9 per cent and unemployment the same as ours. Is the Opposition telling us that, simply by adopting its policies on the consumption tax and on total privatisation, we will improve this country's economic performance?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, union mates. He is basically implying that we ought to be defeating, as is part of the Opposition's policy, the trade union movement, destroying not only its importance in the Australian community but also its relevance to economic activity and to Australian society at large; that we ought to be getting rid of the union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, I guess that Senator Macdonald will be saying that we should be moving towards the New Zealand model: we make sure that the trade union movement has no legal role whatsoever in the relationship between labour and management. Senator Macdonald says that if only we could do that-privatise all the public institutions that really count, bring in a consumption tax, and destroy the power base of the union movement and give it no right to represent workers-Australia would be resurrected and economic management would be vastly improved. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald cannot really believe that cargo cult approach. Every one of those three policies has been tried in New Zealand and in the United Kingdom with disastrous results. In fact, the New Zealand Labour Party was conned into following some of those policy precepts. It was the worst thing that the Labour Party in New Zealand ever did. It ended up paying not only the electoral penalty but also a penalty in terms of its prestige and respect in New Zealand and the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> So one looks to simple solutions. They can be used as electoral ploys, but the real danger is that a party might even come to believe them. If that party really believes them and, by some accident, manages to become the Government of this country one day, heaven help us all. A government should always look internationally at the other economic and political management models that exist around the world, not just at those of the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand and Canada on which it thinks Australian activities should be based. One might go to Sweden, Japan or Germany and ask, `What are the features of those immensely successful economies? What stands out about those economies that we could borrow ideas from?'. </PARA>

What does stand out about those three countries-Germany, Japan and Sweden-first and foremost is the very close relationship they have between a well organised union movement and management and between a well organised union movement and government. Unions are given a rightful role in the management of the economy and of the companies for which the people they represent work. In other words, cooperation is still the most important key to economic management. In German companies German workers sit on the boards as of right. There are formal structures of consultation not only about industrial relations matters but also company investment policies. The Japanese have similar structures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Powell that it is coming too slowly. We are moving towards an acceptance that education and training is a lifetime activity and of value not only to individuals but also to the country at large. These countries have been practising for years the notion that, at the centre of all successful economic activity and sound economic management, is proper education and training. All three countries spend immense amounts on education and training and on research and development. Meanwhile, Australia sits back and says, `Yes, we will move quietly towards improving our expenditure on education and training and we will try to lift the expenditure on research and development in this country'. Those countries are streets ahead of us for the simple reason that they regard education as the fulcrum on which everything is built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will look at the statistics for Germany. Of all people over 15 years of age, 70 per cent go into apprenticeships. Twenty per cent go on to higher education. I will even do the sums for Senator Macdonald. That leaves only 10 per cent who have no training-are not going on to apprenticeships or are not going to higher education-when they pass 15 years of age. At any given time, 39 per cent or more of German workers aged between 19 and 65 are in training. </PARA>

For heaven's sake, we are part of a world economy. I am sick of the debate in Australia being centred on what happens in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand. There are other economies and countries which function better than we do and which are worth borrowing ideas from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are going to be part of that world economy and overcome these problems of unemployment, our balance of trade deficit and the problems in the manufacturing industry, we have to look at the best models in the rest of the world. I make no apology for coming into this chamber and saying, `Let us look at those models and talk about other countries', instead of looking all the time in our own backyard comparing, for example, the Hawke Government with the Fraser Government backwards and forwards and New South Wales with Victoria. In some ways, who cares? Those comparisons involve statistical differences that can sometimes be interpreted one way or the other. The key issue is to go outside ourselves and to look at how it is done elsewhere. It is only when we start to look elsewhere and make those comparisons to find what we can learn from others that will we advance. </PARA>

<PARA> I have really enjoyed educating Senator Macdonald. I was a teacher for nine or 10 years. Occasionally, I would go into a classroom and see about 35 children. In those days classes had about 35 students; then a Labor Government brought down the number of students per teacher in a class to about 24. It was even lower when I was a Minister. When I was a teacher, I used to look at these faces and say, `This is really good. These young people might benefit if I really do my job'. When I succeeded, I got a glow of satisfaction because I would look at each child and say, `That one is not very bright and that one does not want to listen, hear or learn. But if I can just ignite a spark of curiosity and interest, I have succeeded and given them skills'. If nothing else, today I have helped Senator Macdonald and some members of the Opposition to think a little more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad that I speak in this debate after Senator Aulich because, in debating this series of motions from the Opposition-which really represent a litany of the failure of the prevailing economic approach, which is all too much shared by the Government and the Opposition, as almost admitted by Senator Aulich-he has exhorted us to look beyond our shores, to look elsewhere, for inspiration as to what to do about the disastrous economic situation and now the disastrous social pain that is being felt in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I exhort other political parties to look elsewhere, to policies which have been put forward in this place almost ad nauseam as well as out in the community, to policies which provide alternatives, which should be listened to and which should be taken up. I take up that challenge and again lay down an alternative economic approach which is designed on the basis of what the Democrats believe-that is, that government should be working towards a society that is socially and economically just, environmentally responsible and democratically controlled. </PARA>
<PARA> That should be the objective of any Government. Government policy should be designed to influence the economy so that such a society can be achieved. That can be done, but it is not being done by the policies of the Hawke Government; nor will it be done by the implementation of the policies of the conservative alternative government. That is because the Government and the Opposition share deregulatory, free market-driven policy directions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was something of an embarrassment to Senator Aulich to have to complain about the privatisation policies of the Opposition. It is more inclined to more privatisation than the Government. Let us not take comfort in the legislation we have had thus far of so-called partial privatisation. As the Democrats have stood in this chamber and pointed out, the privatisation legislation for the Commonwealth Bank is now a perfect vehicle for total privatisation by either this Government or any subsequent government, as will be the situation for our telecommunications industry, should the legislation that is coming forward pass through this chamber and this Parliament. Nevertheless, it only serves to illustrate the like-mindedness of both the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an officially acknowledged 10 per cent unemployment rate, although the figure is probably more closely in the region of 15 per cent because of the use of lies, damn lies and statistics, as one of the Opposition's motions puts forward. We have a dramatic escalation in the level of unemployment, as has been pointed out earlier by Senator Calvert. A 60 per cent rise in unemployment has occurred in the past 12 months. That is an enormous shock to the system of any community, any society; to the individuals and the families concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> While it may be appropriate to claim that the Opposition is crying crocodile tears, as Senator McMullan has done in this debate, it is surely the responsibility of legislators in this place at least to attempt to do something about unemployment. Our contribution to this debate, at least initially, is to run through briefly the alternative proposals which have been put by my colleagues-including Senator Spindler as Treasury spokesperson, Senator Lees as representative of the social justice portfolio, Senator Bell and Senator Kernot-in past debates on this and other economic issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we have a change; it is now urgent that we have a change. As I have said, this Government and this Opposition are interested and have pursued economic policies of a deregulatory, free market-driven nature. As we say, government must take up its responsibilities and intervene selectively in a targeted way in the economy to achieve the sort of society that certainly we, or any government, should believe ought to be developed for Australians. We have achieved a drop in interest rates and that is one thing that has changed, but we cannot lose sight-and these motions before the Senate today refuse to let us lose sight-of the human misery and the social destruction that has been created as the vehicle for the reduction in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are suggesting very strongly that, if we are going to reduce unemployment, if we are going to create employment, the Federal Government must take responsibility for the elimination of payroll tax, which is a tax on employment. We are putting forward suggestions of ways that that can be done. I want to emphasise our suggestion that there should be a 40 per cent lift in the excise on alcohol and tobacco. Those products are actually costing our community money. To the extent that the pricing regime attached to those products can affect their use, it would not only be a revenue raising measure which then could be used by the Federal Government to reduce payroll tax, but it would also be a major contribution to the better health of our country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that there should be a 5 per cent bounty paid to exporters on new exports in a targeted fashion, so that we can get our exports going, so that we can get our economy back in balance and so that we can support our appropriate industries and create employment. This is now an absolute necessity. In the area of accelerated depreciation-something we have been pushing for some time-we see what has been put forward in the industry statement as being inadequate. It must be increased, especially where it would contribute to our export potential. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is on record recently as chastising the community for wasting the share of profits that the accord has delivered since 1986. We have seen a remarkably greedy business sector, so one thing must be done: we must be assured that company taxes are paid at appropriate rates, and indeed we suggest that possibly the rate of company tax should be increased, if that is the only way we are going to get the corporate sector to pay its way. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich mentioned the need for increased research and development investment in this country. We have an abysmal record. Just as the Government has come up with a training guarantee scheme in order to twist the arms of business and industry to get involved in training programs-a measure which we supported, but had to fix up as it went through-we believe that a research and development guarantee scheme may very well be appropriate in order to ensure that business in this country pays its way in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> Business does not pay its way. It is the exact reverse of the situation we see in countries like Germany, as Senator Aulich has mentioned. In this country, to the extent that we have research and development spending, the great majority comes out of the public purse and the minority, a mere trickle, comes from business and industry, which, in the end, are the beneficiaries. We believe that that is something which government should be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to get involved, and the Government should be generating this involvement, using the development of public infrastructure as a pump priming method. Quite clearly, that is now an urgent need. We have major figures in the Australian Labor Party making those suggestions at long last. I only hope that some of those suggestions will be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be the need for initiatives, perhaps at the grass roots level. In recent days, the Democrats have been discussing our proposal for a community work program, a proposal which was first put forward many years ago in this place and which the Democrats developed and took as far as the then Minister for Social Security, the former Senator Don Grimes. This was back in the very early 1980s. The then Senator Grimes looked at it at the time, but it was lost in a succession of elections and indeed in the process of the Hawke Government's increasing the incidence of jobs and plateauing out employment in the 5 per cent to 6 per cent region. We are calling on the Government to resurface a scheme of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, I happened to be in New South Wales yesterday-the State which the Opposition extols as the great virtuous State which does not have an unemployment problem-where I spent part of the afternoon with unemployed people in the western suburbs. A report of the activities and thoughts of those young people appeared in this morning's Telegraph-Mirror. These young people are seriously looking for work. They are presentable, firm minded and determined young people who are chasing work and not getting it. I discussed with them the Democrats' proposals for a community work program. They were very enthusiastic. They see around their community jobs that need to be done but they and their friends are unable to get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Democrats are saying is that, if government can be flexible about the way unemployment payments are made, a coordinated program-our proposal sees local government as a potential coordinator, although non-government organisations, service clubs and others might be able to be involved-would be able to coordinate putting together the jobs which need doing and the people who want to work. It is a fact that unemployed people want to work. In order to ensure that the unemployed are not exploited-which is what work for the dole schemes are all about-we propose that a service fee be paid on top of the unemployment benefit. This means that when people worked they would not immediately lose that income support which it is our social responsibility to give to people in the community when we cannot and do not provide jobs for them. That service fee would bring these people up to the minimum wage rate, the award rate. They would therefore be doing socially useful work and would not be being exploited. The community would be paying the base unemployment rate to them and that would be topped up by a service fee. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us think about those elderly people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners and superannuants, who own their own homes but who cannot afford to get their fence fixed. Those are the sorts of people whose jobs would be able to be done. Kevin and Nathalie, with whom I spent time yesterday afternoon in the western suburbs at Homebush Bay, could see an area of State government land which needs cleaning up, where there is work to be done. They could see where such a scheme would enable them to work, put value back in their lives and put very important dollars into their pockets. It is a challenge for government, for unions and for the community at large to get behind such schemes as this at the local and community level to see that jobs are done and that people are given work. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich spoke quite a deal about the importance of education. Certainly, the Australian Democrats support the views of Senator Aulich and condemn the inaction and the wind-backs of this Government in that area. We must have an overhaul of the education system. We must consider education as a major resource in our community. In yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald we see the headline `Students turned away as TAFE money runs out'. Many courses around this country are overfull in technical and further education (TAFE). There is an unmet demand for courses in many colleges. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Hundreds of students . . . have been turned away from TAFE courses because TAFE has run out of money to pay for them.</PARA>
<PARA>According to one student, Mr David Stinson, at Katoomba TAFE:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . students enrolled in accounting courses were told last week that they would not be able to continue their studies at the college from 1992 onwards and that no new students would be admitted to the course from the second semester.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether it is this Government's policy that we will not need accountants any more in the future; I hardly think so. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> ``And colleges have suddenly been advised that the budget in TAFE is overspent and key courses cut. Unofficially, principals have heard that TAFE head office miscalculated this year's allocation of funds and is $15m in the red.''</PARA>
<PARA>All those things are no consolation to young people in Australia-and, as Senator Aulich said, 90 per cent of German young people are educated and trained-who are wanting to be educated and are wanting to be trained. Family breadwinners losing their jobs are needing training or retraining, yet courses are full. Those are the people who are now on the unemployment treadmill. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a dramatic cut in apprenticeships, in part as a result of the overcrowding but also as a result of the failure of business to be prepared or to be able to support those apprenticeships. If we look at universities we see that again the demand outstrips places. We have students in overcrowded courses in overcrowded facilities. We need more lecturers urgently. We have not put enough resources into our tertiary education to attract lecturers into it.</PARA>
<PARA> Country students have enormous difficulty accessing courses. Lack of finances is a major problem and, of course, this Parliament has reduced the access of rural children in particular through its miserly approach to the Austudy program, and it stands condemned for that. In 1990, around 20,000 people who qualified for entry to university failed to get a place. I will give the Senate a few headlines from the last few days about the record on education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice of motion standing in the name of Senator Hill, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion, to give precedence to a motion relating to the tabling of written advice, dated 20 March 1991, from the Human Rights Commissioner relating to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not speak to this motion at length because the Australian Democrats have indicated in discussion that they will support the suspension of Standing Orders and that they reserve their right on the substantive motion based on the arguments that are put before the chamber. I will not take an inordinate amount of time of the chamber debating the motion to suspend Standing Orders but to say that this is a fundamental issue which touches the democratic rights and principles of this country and the people in Australia. There can be no more important issue debated in Australian society than the freedom of expression and the democratic rights of individuals within Australia. It is for that reason that I move the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I would have appreciated some notice of this motion other than a bit of a rumour around the place about 30 seconds ago, which did not come from the Opposition. The Government will oppose the suspension of Standing Orders. There are a number of reasons for that, one being the very pre-emptive and undisciplined way in which this matter has been raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing I would like to say to the Senate and Senator Olsen is that I do not know how long he expects this debate to continue. I have made our position clear with respect to those documents. I have to catch a plane not all that long after we get up this evening and go overseas very early tomorrow morning. That puts the Senate in a very difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA> The trip I am going on is for the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Crete, and I have no intention of frustrating my and the Government's commitment to that ceremony. I do not know where Senator Olsen finds himself now. Had he approached this in a more decent way we might have been able to work it out earlier on this afternoon, but any continuation of the debate will place everyone here in a very difficult position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been the Australian Democrats' practice, in the interests of the democratic process and open processes in this chamber, to support suspensions where we did not believe they were essentially mischievous-that is, where we thought a purpose would be served and where we wanted to listen to a debate in order to be guided on a substantive motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am disturbed to know once again-and this has happened before-that, while the Opposition has spoken with us in order to ensure passage of the motion, it has not had the courtesy to go to the Government, particularly where a certain Minister is concerned, to inform it of the process. I was given to understand that if a suspension of this nature was going to occur it would occur before the consideration of General Business. It did not, and that choice was made for some reason or other by the Opposition. The fact that it did not and the fact that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) was not aware that it was going to happen appears to have left the Minister, the Senate and, certainly, me, personally, at quite a loss as to how this matter-if the suspension passes-can be dealt with properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we appreciate the responsibilities of ministerial office which will take the Minister away, I understand, at the dinner break. My Australian Democrat colleagues and I had made a decision to support this suspension, but, as always, my colleagues are perfectly at liberty to vote any way they like when this motion is put. I suggest that there may very well be a division on this matter for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA> I have found it difficult, on this and other occasions, to deal with the Opposition in what I consider to be an honourable and rational way. Frankly, I am angered by this process. In the time that it takes to ring the division bells I, for one, will make up my mind as to how I will vote and I am quite sure those of my colleagues who are listening to me will do the same thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, on that point of order, that standing order relates very much to the normal tabling of papers and those sorts of documents. Taken in its context, standing order 164 (1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Documents may be ordered to be laid on the table, and the Clerk shall communicate to the Leader of the Government in the Senate all orders for documents made by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>To me, that means the tabling of government documents or other documents of Senate committees. I take Senator Ray's point that there is not a power under the Standing Orders for the Senate to insist on the tabling of this document. To assist the Senate and you, Mr Deputy President, in interpreting this standing order, at this stage I refer to a view not from this side of the Parliament but from Sir Robert Menzies who said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. Senator Hill has come a long way. Sir Robert Menzies said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . it would be curious and alarming if an anti-Government Senate could undermine the objectivity and non-political integrity of the Public Service by exposing its senior and most responsible officers to a Parliamentary inquisition from which they had a right to be immune and compelling their entry into a field of political debate. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that would help you, Sir, to interpret the point of order. However, in terms of precedents one can go to Odgers Senate Practice for more of them or, particularly, one can look at the events of 1975, when matters were raised of this sort and it was determined at the time that the Senate did not have the power to insist on the tabling of documents. </PARA>

<PARA> The other time that I believe this matter came up, Mr Deputy President, was in the Tasmanian Parliament in 1960. Fortunately, because of the dinner recess, I have not had a lot of time to research this matter. However, I understand that Prime Minister Holt in October 1967 reaffirmed a similar principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that what we might be setting today is something that has not been done in this Parliament before, namely, demanding a document sent from one person to a Minister. The efficacy of that, given the fact that there are other laws on the discovery of documents, in terms of freedom of information with qualification, is something that this Senate really should consider. We had this sprung on us at 25 minutes past 6, with no forewarning. We may in fact be wrong in the points of order we are making right now but we have not had sufficient opportunity to research the matter and to look to the consequences of this motion, whether it is within the power of the Senate or not within the power of the Senate to consider such a motion. </PARA>

<PARA>An order under paragraph (1) or (2) may be made by a motion without notice moved immediately on the conclusion of the speech of the Senator who quoted the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The key words there are `quoted the document'. Honourable senators will recall that not so long ago we had a similar discussion about Senator Bolkus getting up and quoting from a document. That is quite within the ambit of standing order 168, and no-one challenged that at the time. However, the motion before us asks a Minister to produce correspondence written to him, and table it here. The implication of this eventually for all governments concerns what people write to government. I do not want to see that just ripped up here with a few minutes debate without full consideration. I think it is a separate issue to the sort of issue that we had when we were involved in Senator Bolkus quoting from an internal departmental document. He quoted it here, claimed commercial in confidence and, when we got around that problem, we did not have a problem releasing the document. </PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Bolkus" NAMEID="XE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have two points to raise. First, in terms of clarification, Senator Ray is quite correct. Today I did not quote from any document emanating from the Human Rights Commission. In fact I quoted from no document during Question Time. The document that Senator Olsen is attempting to have produced was not quoted from. I add to the first point I made about Sir Robert Menzies' comments. We should recognise also, as I said before, that Odgers is of some assistance here, in that it is recognised there on page 563, I think, which I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Certainly there are affairs which in the public interest, or for reasons of national security, should be kept confidential; Parliament recognises that principle and the practice is not to press for certain disclosures, such as in relation to Cabinet documents and advice given by officers to Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>The point we are dealing with here obviously is advice that is being given by officers to the Minister involved. As I say, it is pretty clear from the interpretation of the powers of the Senate in the past, not only as recognised by Sir Robert Menzies, but also as recognised by Odgers in his Australian Senate Practice that there is no power in the Senate to so force. If I were to reinforce the point, I would also quote Odgers on page 561 where he recognised, in respect of the loans matter, the plea of privilege that prevailed-as I said, for the time being-and public servants were not by resolution held to be in contempt for refusing to answer questions on ministerial instructions. That assists in defining the sort of power the Senate has. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that Senator Ray was spot on when he asked what if it were the case that the document that was being asked for tonight was an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation report, or a police report, or an National Crime Authority report, or whatever. Basically, the point is that under Standing Orders there is no power and in the way those Standing Orders have been interpreted for quite some time and consistently during that period, the privilege of the Crown has been recognised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on that point of order, Mr Deputy President. There were two matters raised by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Administrative Services that I would like to respond to and draw to your attention. Senator Ray continually referred to the Minister quoting from a document. I draw your attention once again to standing order 168 with its subsections (1),(2) and (3). There is reference first, to a document quoted by a Minister; secondly, to one quoted by a senator, who is not a Minister; and thirdly, to an order made by a motion without notice moved immediately on the conclusion of the speech of the senator who quoted the document. The document was quoted in the sense that it was referred to, not quoted from, which would be in there if it was needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing I would like to draw to your attention, Mr Deputy President, is the fact that the Minister was referring to an `officer'. I ask whether in fact the person concerned is truly an officer for the purposes described in Odgers or whether that person is a statutory appointee and therefore the term `officer' may not be appropriate. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that point of order, I did refer earlier to Prime Minister Holt. I do not know whether that arises in a direct sense here, but the case quoted here was from 17 May 1960. The then Minister for Education in considering this made a statement to which I refer honourable senators, on pages 586 and 587 of Odgers. The only further information I have is to back up what I said before. Speaking in the House of Representatives on 31 October 1967, the Prime Minister, Mr Holt, stated that he agreed with the Tasmanian statement and that it might well be adopted as sound policy. What this also refers and leaves open is the question that may one day arise: what happens if the Senate orders the production of certain papers and the responsible Minister refuses to table such papers? Regrettably no answer was provided there. I suppose that is why we have raised the question today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the second issue, this is a specific case; I think Senator Newman raised the question of whether the person who wrote this particular document or letter-I have not seen it-was an officer. I am not sure; I have not read the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission legislation; I will be straightforward there. The person certainly is not a direct employee of government; I think we all assume that. Again, that is another question of status. I am not trying to delay things because we want to get on with Government Business. I just say that there are greater matters of principle than rushing in for something that I do not even think is going to be a big political advantage if it is tabled and you, Mr Deputy President, will see the essence of that somewhat later tonight, I suspect. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly contribute to this debate. I submit to you, Mr Deputy President, that the passage that the Minister for Administrative Services has just quoted from Odgers, in effect, demonstrates that the Senate does have the power. What it does say, however, is that there is a practice that certain types of documents are not sought under that power, such as Cabinet submissions and matters that relate to national security. Speaking for this side of the chamber, we would not seek to have documents of that nature ordered to be put before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not the type of document that is referred to here as a document relating to national security, the type of document to which the Minister for Defence referred a few minutes ago. It is a document from a statutory body that has not only a responsibility to the Government, but a wider responsibility to the people of Australia that relates to the basic principle upon which proposed Government legislation has been premised. Therefore, it does not fall within the exclusion of the practice that is referred to-and I stress practice rather than a lack of capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> I also suggest to you, Mr Deputy President, that Senator Ray and also Senator Bolkus, to some extent, are blurring the issue of the capacity of the Senate to make the order and also the question of enforcement. We are not here debating the question of enforcement. It may well be, as has been suggested by the Ministers, that there is not a specific power of enforcement. But that is not a subject to be decided in this debate on this particular question of the Standing Orders. Enforcement is something to be settled on another day and, hopefully, in relation to a matter such as this, it will not need to be argued. I separate that debate because I think that it should be separated. But I bring you back to this passage in Odgers which, I suggest, by its very language, makes it clear that in fact the Senate has the capacity to do what is being sought by Senator Olsen. </PARA>

Firstly, during questions and the Minister's response over the past three days, the Minister has referred to advice from the Attorney-General's Department and also to advice that the has been given and discussions that he has had with Mr Burdekin. The Hansard of today indicates a reference to Mr Burdekin and also to advice that the Minister received from the Attorney-General's Department. Therefore, the matter has been raised in the Senate during this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point of order is that in February 1986, Senator Bolkus, in arguing for the establishment of this Commission, referred to it as a body which needs to be the public watchdog for government abuses of human rights. We are talking about a public watchdog and a report from a public watchdog, which is relevant to the matter before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take Senator Newman's point in the technical sense but then I looked at the past practice of the way this particular standing order has been enforced. Generally, we would concede that quotation from a document is the very reason the standing order is there-to protect honourable senators in this place from the Minister coming in, potentially quoting, misusing and misquoting from a document and getting away with it without anyone seeing a document. That is why the standing order is here; to prevent that particular abuse. Therefore, I would argue that my interpretation of what `quoted' and `quotation' are historically has been a more valid one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the first time apparently in 90 years this has come up in the chamber. The fact that it has not come up before means it is not really addressed in that sense in the Standing Orders. Again, it therefore is very difficult for you, Mr Deputy President, I would think, to rule one way or the other because it effectively is the first real ruling on this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks through the record in looking for other guidance in this through parliaments throughout Australia-and no-one has pretended here we have had an extensive search-one cannot find any examples that fully clarify the matter. But again, I know oppositions at times stand on principle and opportunism. I do not know, and I cannot divine, what the motive is here, other than the Opposition is setting a precedent if it says that this chamber can demand any government document because it will affect advice tendered by a whole range of people to government in future. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether this advice was sent to Senator Bolkus on the basis that it would or would not be published. But the Opposition had better be careful in the precedents it sets because the wheel always turns, and it will turn back on the Opposition if it is not careful, and we do not have this thing properly sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA> My initial advice to Senator Bolkus-but he can say what he likes or not if this motion is carried-is at least not to meet the deadline by tonight. If the Senate wants to go to Crete with him and enforce the Act, well good luck to you all. </PARA>

So I am going to ask shortly whether someone would allow me to have a break, say for 30 minutes, so that I can go away and look at the matter properly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assist you further with your deliberations, Mr Deputy President, and refer you to the Hansard of the Senate of 16 July 1975. I do so because at that particular time, the Solicitor-General, the then Mr Byers, in essence the whole question of Crown privilege and the production of documents and witnesses was very much a live issue before this place. At page 2782 of Hansard, Mr Byers was asked by then Senator Withers, `What privilege does the Crown have?', and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am not asserting anything. I am giving my understanding of the law. My understanding of the law is that the privilege resides in the Crown. That privilege may be asserted. It has been. When it has been, the question next arises as to my duty in relation to that assertion. I can see my duty to be no less than keeping secret the Crown's counsel. The duty which the oath of a Federal executive councillor imposes on him is not to reveal matters directly or indirectly. That is my understanding. </PARA>
<PARA>At page 2788, in response to questions by the then Senator Wright, Mr Byers said:</PARA>
<PARA>Again with respect, I do not understand those as but specific examples of the central constitutional notion. The central constitutional notion is the secrecy of the deliberations. That is the central constitutional notion. </PARA>
<PARA>What we have here are very much deliberations and what we also have is an opinion by the first law officer of the Crown at that particular time making it very clear that the power of privilege imposed in the Executive is one that is protected. That is why I say that any interpretation of the Standing Orders needs to take that into account. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be quite a farcical situation if this Senate found that it passed a resolution-as indicated by Senator Hill may be possible-which it could then not enforce in respect to a member of the Senate or an officer, which it attempts to enforce it over. The opinions of Mr Byers, the then Solicitor-General, are fundamentally important when one interprets the Standing Orders in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also suggest that the Parliament has-and the Senate by its committee structure has participated in the development of-a structure which does allow for publication of documents. That, of course, is the Freedom of Information Act. That Act recognises a whole range of exemptions to it. That Act is available to members of the public and members of the Parliament-it has been accessed by both of them. </PARA>
<PARA> That Act was passed by this Senate after some very heavy committee deliberations-a committee that I chaired and I think Senate Hill was deputy chairman. That legislation-the committee's proposal-was there, and provides for us a framework to ensure what documents are provided and what are not in accordance with the privileges that have been protected through history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he relies on Odgers, that is right. Those documents would only be excluded if the Minister concerned could discharge the onus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister claimed that it was a document relating, say, to defence there would be nothing, according to the Opposition, to stop it saying, `We want to see those documents to establish whether or not they relate to defence'. It is my proposition that the onus is not on the Minister but the other way. That would seem to me to flow from the way in which chapter 26 is set up. I shall go to that in a moment. That would seem to be correct. If the onus lay the other way, all that would have to happen for all sorts of documents to be produced is for either side of the House to ask the other for a document. There is nothing under this proposition to stop the Government side of the House saying to the other side, `We want all the documents that in any way relate to the policy that the Opposition will adopt on social security, defence or what have you'. If Senator Michael Baume is right, it would then be incumbent on the other side to prove that it should not be produced. Standing order 26, paragraph 164 (1), reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Documents may be ordered to be laid on the table, and the Clerks shall communicate to the Leader of the Government in the Senate all orders for documents made by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not confined to the government situation; it is general. We could ask the Australian Democrats to produce all the documents that they have relied upon to come to their decision about a particular policy, or all the documents which, say, Senator McLean produced when he was talking to the many people who came to see him about the banking inquiry. In other words, if we open this can of worms we are opening it not only in respect of the Government but in respect of everybody in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I could say now to Senator Powell, somebody for whom I have nothing but the greatest admiration-and I am not saying this in any way to prompt this, but just by way of illustration-`I now call upon you to produce all the documents that you have used to come to your policy on the economy, and all the letters that have been sent to you by your constituents. On the analysis made by Senator Michael Baume, unless you can show that they ought not to be produced, they are to be laid on the table. Our eminent Clerk shall communicate to the Leader of the Government in the Senate all the orders for the document by the Senate, and when we have gone through that process all your documents will have to be put on the table'. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that one of the reasons why, as Senator Robert Ray has pointed out, over 90 years there has not been a precedent for this is that, if tonight this Senate votes for Senator Bolkus to produce the documents, there is nothing to stop Senator Ray coming in tomorrow and demanding all the documents that he wants from the other side. </PARA>

If we are to go on a fishing expedition in respect of Senator Bolkus, we can go on fishing expeditions in respect of everybody here. It would seem to me that, on the basis that this matter has been put forward tonight, it would be a little inconsistent for this chamber to require Senator Bolkus to put forward the documents which those on the other side want should they then refuse to put their own documents forward if we want them to do so tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If, on the other hand, it seems on the face of the debate in the chamber that it is essential for the proper functioning of the chamber that a document should be put forward, it should come forward. But, on the evidence so far, there is nothing to indicate that it is in the interests of the Senate and its workings to know what conversations took place in private or what documents were prepared in private between Senator Bolkus and anybody else. It does not affect the Bill as drafted, excepting that this was another element in the various discussions that took place prior to its being drafted. It seems to me very dangerous to go ahead tonight to look at this document in these circumstances. </PARA>

I do not understand how he can do that. He has suspended Standing Orders to move this motion about a particular document, and then he moves a different motion pertaining to another document or documents. I do not understand how we can let that go by, Mr Deputy President. It is something that should be sorted out. It will not foreclose this debate because it can be moved again, I suppose, in another form, but it may also lead to putting the Minister into a farcical position as to which document he produces. I suspect that if Senator Olsen had given us some notice and typed up the things and circulated them around the chamber-I know that sometimes one does these things on the run, but he has been thinking about the matter for three days-we would not have run into this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief, Mr Deputy President. I want to address the suggestion that a unique application is being made and, furthermore, that orders of this nature have not been made in the past. I suggest to you that when you retire to deliberate on this matter you will find many occasions on which orders similar to this have been made. One that I have put my hand upon at very short notice occurred on only 7 November last year and related to a series of documents concerning the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Durack, who unfortunately had to leave the chamber to meet another obligation, made mention to me of a legal opinion that he was once required to table as Attorney-General. As I said, Mr Deputy President, I suspect that, when you start going through the historical records, as you will when this adjournment is given for that purpose, you will find many instances. There is nothing unusual in this process at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the debate has been about the question as to whether the motion should or should not be carried on its merits. It reminds me of the experience we had just a few days ago when we were seeking from Senator Bolkus the production of another series of documents. We accepted that parts of those documents that were genuinely commercial in confidence should not be the subject of our application, which gets back to the point of practice rather than the point of law. As a matter of practice, we therefore excluded them. In that instance one of the documents was a legal opinion to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We believed that as a matter of practice we should not include that within our motion. Honourable senators may well have said that, had we included it, as a matter of practice they should not have passed a motion if it included such a document that was clearly commercial in confidence. That is a question of the merits on the debate, which is another stage of the issue. This debate is all about whether the Senate has the capacity to carry the motion. I suggest that not only has it the capacity to do so but that it has also done so on many occasions in the past. I bring to your attention simply that one example of 7 November 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful to you, Mr Deputy President, for this brief opportunity to address this point of order. I wish to tackle three arguments put forward by my good friend and colleague Senator Cooney from the other side of the chamber. His arguments were basically these: there is a separation of the Executive from the Parliament; the second argument was that this could lead to a very dangerous precedent because any document could be ordered to be produced; the third argument related to burden of proof of public interest or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cooney's first argument relates to Dicey's rule of law which says that there is a separation between the Executive, Parliament and the judiciary. That is, indeed, the case. There is also a whole string of cases in which actions of one have been subject to the scrutiny of another. The classic case in point is a recognition of that in the Acts Interpretation Act where provision is made for the interpretation of an Act by consideration of what is said in the Parliament. In that respect, I think that Australia is somewhat different from the United Kingdom. It is very important that we draw very careful distinctions in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the other point that, whilst we have an Executive, the authority of that Executive to make decisions is necessarily a delegation of certain powers of the Parliament itself, which is why this Parliament exists to scrutinise and to examine the decisions and activities of the Executive. It has never been a principle in this Constitution or, indeed, within the Westminster system that the Executive is exempt from scrutiny. Therefore, the basis of Senator Cooney's first argument that the documents should not be tabled because our documents belong to the Executive is, with great respect to my good friend, quite simply false. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cooney's second argument was that it creates a very dangerous precedent because any document could be ordered to be produced. I think here there are some unwritten, but nonetheless recognised, distinctions which are made between an honourable senator acting in the capacity as a Minister and an honourable senator acting in a private capacity as a senator. The argument which we made against an order for production of documents from a private senator on the Opposition side or from the crossbenches is that it would be an oppression of that honourable senator's freedoms, which are recognised as part of our common law and which predate the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an argument that a senator, acting in the capacity as a Minister, is subject to the same scrutiny that any other member of the Executive is subject to. Therefore, it is very easy to draw the distinction between which documents could, under the common law which underlies the whole Constitution and underlies the standing orders, be ordered to be produced. Clearly, they are only documents which are official in nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst a document may have a certain status within a party on this side, or on the other side, it is doubtful whether any motion could be carried successfully, or be valid, which would order the production of a party document. I think the distinction has to be made between whether the Senate would have the capacity to order an honourable senator to produce a document which relates to his or her party's activities-on reflection, at this moment, I would have to say that I doubt it-or whether we would require an honourable senator who is a member of the Executive to produce official documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the whole framework of our legislative system-in particular, the freedom of information legislation-recognises certain categories of documents which may be in the possession of members of parliament which are still subject to scrutiny. Therefore, that creates a precedent for the sorts of things we are doing here. It is a well-known principle that the Senate can determine its own procedures. Therefore, Mr Deputy President, I submit to you that the presentation of the document is not out of order; it is within the scope of the Senate so to order. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point relates to Senator Cooney's argument that it would be up to the side moving for the order for the documents to be tabled to prove the public interest. I disagree most strongly. There is a grave difficulty, an evidentiary difficulty, with this; that is, quite simply, this side would not know what the documents were and, therefore, could not prove the public interest of the documents because this side would never know the contents. The Minister, of course, does know the contents of the documents and is in a position to make a case that it is not in the public interest to table the documents. That is my first objection to Senator Cooney's third argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a second objection to his third argument which is this: in Senator Cooney's argument there is a presumption which runs against freedom of both the individual and parliament to determine their own procedures. As I said, it is a longstanding principle that a parliament has a right to determine its own procedures. This is a presumption which would have the effect of fettering parliament's own discretion in respect of its procedures but placing upon parliament, and individual members of the parliament, an evidentiary requirement which they would be incapable of fulfilling. It is a longstanding principle of the common law that no law, ruling, or judgment shall be made which is unenforceable or which brings the law into disrepute by making it an absurdity. I respectfully submit that, for this second reason, Senator Cooney's third argument is also false. </PARA>
<PARA> I close my arguments in relation to Senator Cooney's third proposition by saying that it has been recognised in other jurisdictions which have a common law basis-in particular the United Kingdom-that there are certain public interests and certain public freedoms, the protection of which has overridden statute and sometimes other common laws. I refer particularly to the Official Secrets Act in the United Kingdom under which it is an offence to disclose certain matters which are covered by that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Ponting case-I hasten to add that the father of a very good friend of mine was a judge who sat on that case-it was recognised that, although Mr Ponting had disclosed documents which were covered by the Official Secrets Act, and had prima facie committed an offence to which there was no defence, the jury sitting on the case ruled that, in spite of the direction from the judge to convict Mr Ponting, he be acquitted because it was held by the jury, although it was not subsequently challenged successfully in any court, that there was a public interest category, a public interest defence, which justified certain actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the parallel between that recognition of a public interest argument and the sorts of public interest arguments that this side of the chamber is putting tonight, particularly the importance of the public interest argument, to overturn Senator Cooney's arguments with regard to the burden of proof. Mr Deputy President, I thank you most sincerely for this opportunity to speak. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel there are a few points that should be made with regard to the tabling of this report. As the Senate will remember, an inquiry was conducted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts following a reference from the Senate which, in turn, followed a report of Estimates Committee A, which found that one of the witnesses appearing before Estimates Committee A had lied to the Committee and subsequently wrote to the Committee and confessed that that was the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee considered this matter in great detail. The findings of the Committee concerned the individual players in the illegal secret account-otherwise known as the `unofficial account'-which was established by certain officers within the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO), taking so-called obsolete equipment; namely computers, and selling them for a sum of $88,000. The Constitution was broken; the Audit Act was broken; the Finance Regulations were broken. In fact, there was a culture that pervaded the place that said that they were people who were not covered by the Public Service Act, or the other legislation that I have mentioned, and that they were somehow a law unto themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that had that unofficial or secret illegal account not been detected, it could have gone on being a cipher of funds for an unspecified time. The fact that we were able to detect the existence of that account through the Estimates committee hearings meant that we were able to terminate both the account itself and the practice that had been established. Further, I make the very strong point that I am very pleased to see that secretaries of certain departments have taken the case up and used it as an example in instructing members of their staff that they must properly conduct themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the findings of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts concerning the principal players were very strong and very definite. Indeed, they included a recommendation that one particular party, who no longer works for the Crown, should be very seriously deterred from ever doing so again. That is a very serious finding for the Committee to make. I am pleased to recount that, in reports that come back to me, there is a sense of appreciation that the matters were pursued, firstly by Estimates Committee A and then by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It ensures that the message that all public servants are just that is received by those concerned and informs public servants that they are compelled to comply with the Public Service Act 1922, the Constitution, the Audit Act 1901 and the Finance Regulations by which they are covered. </PARA>
<PARA> I have cited at least one copy of the instructions of the Secretary of a department which are in accordance with the new requirements. They are comprehensive and they have been followed up by that Secretary. I would be most interested to ascertain how many secretaries of other departments have compiled a similar manual and are instructing their staff in the way in which this report of the Public Accounts Committee instructs they ought to be so informed. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat the really worrying and unresolved aspect of this PISO unofficial or illegal account: had we not detected this cipher of public moneys-it was $88,000-what else could have been sold off in the same way? What else could have been pushed through this illegal account and how would that money have been dispensed? If one reads the report, one sees that some of the money was spent on the now infamous weekend at the Hilton Hotel. One will see that the money funded the purchase of all sorts of extraordinary chattels such as a cocktail cabinet to furnish a room for the comfort of the people who were involved. But, in truth, unless this account had been detected in the way it was, there was no way that the practice of selling articles and items could not have gone on indefinitely, for years, without being detected. That is the very worrying aspect because one asks oneself the question, `If it could happen in this department, could it happen in others and, indeed, has it happened in others?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again we relied on the scrutiny process, the efficacy of the Auditor-General and the various committees of scrutiny and finally this Parliament, where a sense of responsibility prevailed. The Senate will remember that the recommendation to refer this matter came not in a partisan way but jointly by all the members-Government and Opposition-of Estimates Committee A calling for this further inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Without sounding the importance of this Committee too highly, in a way it is indeed a benchmark. It does point to the fact that the Public Service must make itself informed of its duties and obligations. It is not open to members of the Public Service to say, `We do not think or believe we are covered by the law in this regard'. It is an important report in that way. It can contribute overall to an improvement in the administration of the expenditure of the taxpayers' dollar and ensure that the taxpayers get value for that expenditure. The final duty that all of us have on both sides of this chamber is to the taxpayer, the constituent and the voter. All those titles can represent the same person, but that is the person to whom we have a responsibility which we must meet. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important report; it made important points. As I have said, I am pleased that those points have been picked up by those who have a responsibility within the Public Service for ensuring that proper conduct is followed. It is beholden upon us all to ensure that not just some of the secretaries of departments follow, maintain and carry out their responsibilities, but that they all do. I guess that slowly, department by department, we will ascertain who is efficient, who is competent and who is not. This report has been an important part of the scrutiny process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make somewhat similar remarks to those of my colleague Senator Bishop in relation to The Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) `Unofficial Account' report. In doing so, I acknowledge the role that Senator Bishop played in this report and her penetrating investigatory analysis that brought so much to light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the focus of this report has been on the immediate participants in the unofficial account as required by the terms of reference to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. However, the Senate should not close its eyes to the lack of top management supervision. While I have a great deal of sympathy for the position of the Presiding Officers at the time, they less than adequately addressed their wider management obligations. Since then they have attended to the detail and systems have been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The PISO report should not have been necessary. It is indeed a sad day for our Parliament and our democratic system. At the lower level within the parliamentary administration events went dreadfully wrong. Here in the parliamentary administration the day-to-day administrators, people who should have known the rules, were not informed and, further, chose not to be informed. However, it is not unreasonable to assume that these executives should not need to be educated in the rudimentary requirements of their offices. Their business is to know. While parliamentarians expect others to have proper systems of accountability, the very basics of the control mechanisms were never implemented by the PISO officers. </PARA>
<PARA> A basic question remains unanswered: why did those responsible for setting up an illegal, unofficial account, into which the proceeds of the sale of Commonwealth assets were deposited and withdrawn for unofficial purposes, go to so much trouble with so little communication and with no official records being kept? Computer Power Pty Ltd, the outside firm in question into whose bank account the public servants illegally deposited the Commonwealth moneys from the sale of those assets, has, in my view, been treated very lightly by the Commonwealth Attorney-General, the Auditor-General and, indeed, by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it totally unacceptable for a firm of this size with considerable dealings with the Government to accept funds into its books illegally to facilitate such a scheme or arrangement. It is really astonishing that those dealing so closely with government expenditure have had virtually no sanction applied to them. One cannot help but wonder whether there is one rule or procedure for the public at large and another for employees or subcontractors working for the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is indeed a sad day for parliament that a report such as this has had to be tabled. I remind honourable senators that initially, had the Presiding Officers taken a more active management role, then perhaps this sorry episode may not have happened. I regret that I have to say this, but the Presiding Officers have the sorts of responsibilities of company directors and should have exercised their powers at the time accordingly. They do now, but they did not then. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that there is a view that devolution of responsibilities through the ranks absolves the delegator, in this case, the Presiding Officers. The Parliamentary Librarian received a verbal wrap across the knuckles for not drawing the matter to the attention of the Presiding Officers and for the length of time taken to call in the Auditor-General to investigate rumours concerning the existence of an unofficial account. He was also admonished for having engaged a consultant whose field of expertise was not auditing and who was therefore unable to provide authoritative advice. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Parliamentary Librarian's responsibilities were by then difficult to exercise as a result of the ambiguous reporting responsibilities, a reporting arrangement which was instigated from above and which was far from satisfactory. But it is one that finds its way into a number of Commonwealth areas. This is rather serious. The managers of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office were allowed direct access to the Presiding Officers on information systems matters, thereby bypassing the Parliamentary Librarian. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of organisational charts taking the place of responsible dotted lines of authority is anathema to normal procedures, and yet this was allowed. We still find it in examinations by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts of many departments and statutory authorities. It is just not good enough. Responsibilities must be clarified and detailed. Organisational charts tend to be the excuse, on the one hand, for unnecessary meddling and, on other occasions, the reason for non-performance. Therefore, I call on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance to focus attention on the shortcomings of diffused accountability and to clarify a very unsatisfactory position which is widespread across the public sector. I add that this dotted line diffusion no longer applies in the case of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office.</PARA>
<PARA> The reporting arrangements put in place by the Presiding Officers tend to diminish the Parliamentary Librarian's ability to exercise his authority over PISO. However, as a departmental secretary, which is what the Parliamentary Librarian is, he had a statutory responsibility to assert his control. In this case it was a formidable task, given the uncertainties of the scope of his authority, when the offending parties had the opportunity of bypassing him. Others in similar roles within the Public Service should take note of this unfortunate situation which arose to ensure that the same thing does not happen to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation was not helped by an absence of internal audit, and thus we have the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts:</PARA>
<PARA>Each parliamentary department that has not already done so should establish, as a matter of priority, an adequately resourced internal audit function. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, there was a lack of minuting of major decisions, which smacks of unprofessionalism in management. The current fashion in the public sector is to concentrate on outputs rather than inputs. Thus we now have a system where senior officers claim to be unaware of financial obligations and unaware of parliamentary requirements with regard to Finance directives. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully, for the first and last time, a situation has arisen where a private account was established into which funds from the sales of Commonwealth assets were deposited. These funds were then used for dubious purposes. Right at the centre of the democratic system such things should never have happened. We expect officers to perform according to the law and to establish correct procedures. The positions of the Presiding Officers are akin to those of directors and managers, but one does not get the fruits of office without the detailed responsibilities of management. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in the initial case the Presiding Officers cannot be absolved from some neglect. However, I am pleased to report that, having taken upon themselves responsibilities in this area, they are now highly professional and efficient, but at the time they left themselves open to question, not that they received any benefit or that they were involved in any way. As the chief executive officers, they had the ultimate responsibility to ensure that there were proper systems and procedures so that these sorts of practices were impossible. The report now acknowledges that the Presiding Officers take a more active role and have implemented adequate control procedures. I regret that this has been necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak for very long, but I want to draw the attention of the Senate to a couple of issues in relation to the report Active Citizenship Revisited. As honourable senators would be aware, the report is the second in about 18 months on the same issue. I think it is fair enough to indicate that, in about a year or 18-months time, we will again look at the issue to see what has been done so far and to see whether, in fact, our original recommendations have been carried out and whether matters have improved throughout Australia in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a very good reason for that. All too often very good Senate committee reports are brought into this chamber, debated and then left on a shelf. Governments respond within the appropriate time. Sometimes governments take up some of the issues and recommendations. On many occasions they do not. Some reports are responded to with a degree of alacrity. Others are not responded to in the appropriate time, and the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has from time to time made comments about that too. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all else, though, it is essential for all honourable senators to ensure that reports that come into this chamber, given that the vast majority of them have been the product of a great deal of intellectual and political effort, ought not to be left to gather dust on a shelf. They ought to be responded to, not only by governments, but also by the bureaucrats who advise governments and who are responsible for carrying out any decisions governments may make as a result of reading and studying the reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Active Citizenship Revisited is the second report in what I hope will be a series of reviews about the way democracy is promoted in our society. I once again remind the Senate that only a handful of democracies have existed continuously since the turn of this century. Luckily, Australia happens to be one of them. Democracy is not just something that drops out of heaven as a gift to all of us and is here to stay forever. It is something which requires the efforts, the understanding, the education and the participation of the whole community in order to ensure that it does continue and is an active method of government. </PARA>
<PARA> This report made many recommendations and assessed the current improvements that have been made in the teaching of active citizenship throughout this country. The State education Ministers at their annual meeting in Hobart accepted that the teaching of active citizenship should be one of the 10 major factors or issues to be taught in the school curricula. In other words, it was elevated to an essentially important position in education throughout Australia. The big question, of course, is now whether or not that theoretical decision to make active citizenship so important a part of the curriculum for all Australian school students will be followed up in practice. In other words, are the resources to be put aside? Is thinking going to be done which will enable, for example, appropriate resources-that is, teaching materials-to be made available? Are teachers to be trained in the appropriate way? Will courses be written which are imaginative and realistic and which encourage students to involve themselves actively in democracy around them-that is, in their own local councils, sports clubs, local communities and, of course, ultimately in politics in general?</PARA>
<PARA> It is a big question and it is something that is not going to happen overnight. It will happen as a result of a long, calculated campaign on the part of all politicians-all people in government, including local government-and all teachers who have an interest in ensuring that Australia remains not only a democratic society but a fundamentally viable democratic society. It is all very well for us to be in this chamber and feel that democracy is doing very nicely out there in the community, thank you very much, but I can assure the Senate that the practice of democracy is not just what goes on this in this chamber. It is also a question of whether, for example, the voters out there are informed, whether they are interested rather than apathetic about political issues, and whether they are prepared to put in for themselves-to say, for example, not `they ought to do it' but `we will do it'. If we are to look for a slogan which summarises the whole question of active citizenship, it is just that: replacing `they ought to' with `we will'.</PARA>
<PARA> That applies to every aspect of people's lives, from the relationships that exist within their own family to the schools which they teach in or go to as students, to the local council, the local sporting club or whatever. It is a question of giving people the skills in order to give them the enthusiasm, the confidence and the self-respect to be active participants in the groups to which they belong. Active Citizenship Revisited is a second report. I hope it will not be the last and I hope that each report indicates a clear progression or improvement in the way we approach the teaching of democracy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> I leave the Senate with one thought in relation to the type of materials which are available in schools not only for students but also for the teachers. Our first report indicated that many teachers are not at all at home with the teaching of political science, let alone the general techniques of teaching active citizenship. That applies particularly in years 11 and 12 where, for example, many students for many reasons deliberately choose not to take political science. That is partly because the subject is not interesting and partly because it does not seem to carry the prestige which would enable one to get a better choice when one enters university. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that I understand that former Senators Macklin, Puplick and Black are currently working on a project which would provide course materials for years 11 and 12 students and for teachers involving a very modern, realistic and imaginative approach to the teaching of politics. The members of this group come from three political parties. I am sure the project will be challenging. They have certainly got their ideas together in terms of the techniques they will use. It will not be just written material but will involve computer files and videotapes-in other words, the whole caboodle. </PARA>
<PARA> In this way, for the first time, we may get some really interesting and exciting material not only into the hands of years 11 and 12 students but also into the hands of the teachers themselves, who in many cases need a lot of education in this area. I wish those three former senators the best of luck in this project. As I said, if I were going to take a punt on whether or not it would sell and be very effective, I think I would choose these three people to put together that particular work. The three major parties in this chamber, no doubt, will all rush out and buy copies of it. They will be waiting for it to appear on the bookshelf. For the first time since I have been in the Senate I am actually doing a little promo for those others who have left this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I thank you for your time. Above all else, I need to say that the cooperation that I have received as Chairman from past and present members of the Committee in this area has been extremely encouraging. It is fair to say that on this Committee there has been a genuine tripartisan approach to the issue, because all of the Committee members recognise just how important an issue this is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad to have the opportunity to support the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, Senator Aulich, on the report Active Citizenship Revisited. I want to make a few further remarks on this concept and the importance of this report. Active citizenship is defined in the report as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a compound of knowledge, skills and attitudes: knowledge about how society works; the skills needed to participate effectively; and a conviction that active participation is the right of all citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>The report clarifies the role of active citizenship as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . participation and empowerment as well as formal knowledge of institutionalised parliamentary and political processes.</PARA>
<PARA>The previous report issued by the Committee entitled Education for Active Citizenship found:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . most young people's knowledge of parliamentary politics remains woefully inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>We also found that there was a serious discrepancy between curriculum theory and classroom practice. The Committee was presented with evidence which created a bleak picture of ignorance and apathy. In Australia there is a lack of knowledge of the political process, a marked lack of interest in the political process and a lack of innovative programs to correct this. The Committee was presented with a number of reasons for this situation. Parents and schools are more inclined towards curricula that appear to lead to employment rather than social education. Initiatives require support which is not available. There is a lack of curriculum materials. Some political studies courses have turned into a boring collection of mental stodge. Teachers tend to retreat to the safety of a neutral approach to the subject-facts and figures rather than stimulating debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that one of the reasons why teachers do not do enough in this area is that they have difficulty with the problem of teaching values, since values vary with individuals and with different social groups. One of the contributions that I was able to make to this report related to this question of values. I indicated that one of the ways of resolving the dilemma was to distinguish between `procedural' and `substantive' values. Substantive values are the beliefs that people hold, such as their views on a particular political issue. A teacher should teach about these values and facilitate informed debate rather than impose their views on students. Procedural values are those values that we all support in a democratic society: freedom, toleration, fairness, respect for truth and respect for reasoning. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the key values which underpin democratic society. It is both proper and desirable for teachers to nurture and strengthen these in students. The Committee emphasises in the report the importance of values learning on the part of students rather than values teaching on the part of the teacher. The Committee spelt this out very clearly, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Teachers should give students the opportunity to examine a range of value positions as the basis for forming their own judgments.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, on political matters. I emphasise that education for active citizenship is a different way of teaching. It is, in fact, active learning. There are a number of activities which are appropriate to this, including mock parliaments, debates on political issues, media tracking and analysis and field trips, to name just a few. The Committee found in its latest report throughout the nation over 20 innovative programs which use these types of active learning experiences. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently in my own city there was an excellent example of an active citizenship program in action. A group of students were brought into the Newcastle City Council chambers and, in a mock parliament, went through all of the procedures relating to the second reading of a Bill. This is exactly the kind of program which the Committee had in mind when we reasserted at the end of the report our strong belief in the importance of providing citizens with a thorough induction into the mechanisms of parliamentary democracy, with a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and with the motivation to participate actively in the creation of the country's future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will now rule on the points of order taken in relation to the motion by Senator Olsen to require the tabling of a certain document. During the adjournment of the debate I have consulted with Mr President and the Clerk of the Senate, and kept in mind the arguments which were presented to me on the points of order. Mr President agrees with the ruling as follows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Olsen signed and handed in his motion. The signed motion is taken to be the motion as moved, and it is on the basis of that motion that I make my ruling. Standing order 164 provides that the Senate may order the tabling of any document and there are no exemptions or exceptions in the standing order. It is for the Senate to determine whether any motion for the tabling of the document should be passed. There are a number of precedents for legal advices and other advices to Ministers being tabled in response to orders of the Senate, and there are also precedents for Ministers arguing that legal advices should not be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA> The argument which the Senate has heard really goes to the question of whether the motion moved by Senator Olsen should be passed, rather than whether the motion is in order. If the responsible Minister considers that there are reasons for not tabling the document, that is a matter which may be argued in debate on the motion. If the motion is passed, it is then for the Minister to decide whether to comply with the order of the Senate. There is no doubt that the motion is in order under standing order 164, and the question of whether the document should be ordered to be tabled is for the Senate to consider and determine. I call Senator Olsen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion that I have moved, I want to deal with it in three parts: the importance of this issue; why advice that the Government has received from Mr Burdekin is important, and why it ought to be available to this Senate; and why that ought to be tabled now. We are talking about issues of fundamental importance which can be best summarised by a group called Article 19. I will quote from a release from that group dated 19 March. I preface my remarks by saying that Article 19 is the International Centre Against Censorship. It is a London-based international human rights organisation which works impartially to defend the right to freedom of expression and to campaign against censorship around the world. In other words, it is equivalent to Amnesty International. In relation to the Government's legislation that we have before us today, Article 19's press release claims that it will:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . constitute an unnecessary intrusion on freedom of political expression. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Australian government's proposals go beyond these acceptable limits. The Government's stated need to guard against corruption should not infringe the right to freedom of expression-the Government shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is common political wisdom that access to the news media gives tremendous advantage to the government party. All-out denial of access to the media whether by denying political advertising or free-time will benefit incumbents and does not create a level playing field for all parties and lobby groups. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The electronic media plays an important role in the democratic right to influence public opinion. Political parties and lobby groups which demonstrate a desire and need to have access to the electronic media should be granted this access. </PARA>
<PARA>Those comments from Article 19-from an organisation protecting the rights of freedom of expression throughout the world-clearly demonstrate the importance of the issue that we are debating here. I think the importance is also underscored by the lengths to which the Government has gone this evening in an attempt to not have this motion debated before this House and the lengths to which the Government wants to ensure that the documentation-the advice received from Mr Burdekin-does not go onto the public record. There can be only one reason for that: the Government is embarrassed by the report of Mr Burdekin, in that it clearly challenges the legislation and the Government's direction as infringing the rights of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last three days I have raised a number of questions which have gone to the heart of this matter: the heart of democracy in Australia, the fundamental right of people and the freedom of expression of people in this country. In these questions I clearly identified-and the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) did not deny any one of the allegations contained in the questions-that the development of this legislation is impermissible under the covenant. He referred to some Attorney-General's advice but he did not go on to rebut Mr Burdekin's advice, which is, I understand, well argued in a lengthy document. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor did he rebut the fact that the Government's legislation takes another step. The most serious effect of the ban relates to the impact on the accessibility to information of blind and other sight-impaired Australians who presently number some 110,000. In addition to that, more than one million Australians are functionally illiterate. As I understand it, the advice goes on to say that a ban on political advertising, as the Government is proposing in the electronic media, is likely to have a discriminatory impact on these people's right to take part in public affairs. What we are talking about here is infringing upon the rights of a group of Australians and taking away their right to participate fully in public affairs of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what Mr Burdekin is putting to the Government and that is the advice that the Government is trying to keep from the Australian people, the Senate and the House of Representatives. Article 19 also makes the point that the distinction between free speech and bought speech is neither sustainable nor helpful in the context of ascertaining our international legal obligations. It has been clearly pointed out by Article 19-whether it be point two or point three-that Australia has international obligations. We guarantee people, as Australian residents, the right to freedom of speech, the right to participate in democracy and the right to be activists within our community. That is what we are talking about: individual and fundamental rights for Australians. The Government's proposal would remove those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> A London-based organisation, which is the equivalent of Amnesty International, has clearly highlighted how the Government's proposals are removing those rights from Australians. The Minister for Administrative Services, in response to the questions I have asked in the course of this week, has not denied that there are 110,000 people in the Australian community who are sight-impaired in some way and that there are one million people who are functionally illiterate whom this legislation will discriminate against. The Minister offered no defence in answering the questions that I put to him during this week-no defence at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that on each occasion I asked that he put that advice before the Parliament so that we can make a value judgment on it. In addition to that, I stressed today that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune, to which the Minister consistently in this House, in press releases and in the public arena has used as the basis for the need for this legislation--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Parer" NAMEID="KI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Abused.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DU4">Senator OLSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he has, because it is misleading and incomplete in some respects-apparently we had Mr Burdekin's advice to the Government-and to the extent that the report may have materially misled the Government. If that is the case, why is the Government pursuing this matter? Why is the Government not prepared to take this advice on board? I understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in the House of Representatives today-he made some acknowledgment-that the Government is going to re-assess its position on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I certainly hope that that happens, and quickly, because what the Government is proposing denies what are fundamental rights of Australians. Article 19 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights is quite clear and specific as to what it guarantees to Australians. It is important that these rights be maintained. Article 19 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA>Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that what is clearly spelt out in Article 19 of that covenant, to which we are a signatory and of which we are a supporter and which we attempt to guarantee as part of our international obligations, is being thwarted by the Government's legislative direction. Mr Burdekin has said as much to the Government. I find it interesting, and perhaps a sad irony, that in February 1986 Senator Bolkus, in arguing for the establishment of the Human Rights Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that our legal protections fall short in many respects of internationally accepted standards. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Bolkus said in 1986, yet here he is today the architect of legislation that takes away the internationally accepted standards to which Australia is a guarantor and a signatory. We need to ensure that Australia's undertaking to uphold the right of free speech is actually put into practice, that we practise what we preach, and that we put into effect what our international obligations are. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government set up the Commission so that it could act as a public watchdog as regards public abuses of human rights. That is its charter. It is an independent body charged with the responsibility of protecting the human rights of Australians. In this instance, the Government has conveniently chosen to muzzle the Commission, I suggest, in order to mislead and misinform the public. This calls into question in a very serious, fundamental and important way the direction that the Government is taking. </PARA>
<PARA> The documentation that we are asking to have tabled goes far beyond the category of departmental or ministerial information. It contains advice that is crucial not only to the internal politics of our country but also to our standing overseas. That is how important and how crucial this issue is. It contains advice which tackles the issues of freedom of expression and freedom of speech. To use the words of Franklin Roosevelt in 1941:</PARA>
<PARA>The world must be founded upon four essential freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA>The first of them is freedom of speech and expression, which is tackled by the Government in the legislation before the Parliament. Why do we want this advice? Surely the Parliament has a right to see advice from the Australian Human Rights Commissioner that legislation to ban political advertising is a contravention of our basic democratic right of freedom of expression and speech. To refuse the Australian community access to this information is a crime far beyond even that of the political advertising legislation. Surely, no Minister or government has the right to hide or ignore advice from the Human Rights Commissioner about an infringement of the freedom of speech and expression of Australians. This goes to the very point of calling into question our obligations internationally to meet the guaranteeing and standing up for those international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question is: why now? The issue is important. That is clear beyond doubt. The Human Rights Commissioner's view on this is important. He is the public watchdog on human rights in this country, as established by the Parliament. I have demonstrated clearly how the proposed legislation infringes on the fundamental human rights of Australians. Why should we have this right now? We want this advice now because the matter is to be debated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday week, 28 May, where the guillotine is applying at the moment. The Parliament is expected to debate this important piece of legislation without very important and fundamental advice being made available to the Parliament so that it can judge that legislation. </PARA>

It is interesting that Senator Powell should be using the Government's defence, which it has used for a couple of days. The Government's defence is that the advice that it got from Mr Burdekin was before the Bill was drawn up. On Tuesday this week, the Minister had a meeting with Mr Burdekin in his office--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, and the point I make is that the advice that was given earlier to the Government over the course of this period and the advice given to the Government subsequent to the Bill being introduced in Parliament has not changed. That is why Mr Burdekin was summoned to the Minister's office on Tuesday night, where they had a very frank exchange of views, and the Human Rights Commissioner has not changed his original advice. Whether that advice was tendered the day before the Bill was introduced or one month before the Bill was introduced is irrelevant. The advice of the Human Rights Commissioner is the same today as it was a month ago. The Government's defence that his advice was based on something other than legislation is totally irrelevant to this argument. The advice is the same today as it was a month ago. Therefore, the advice tendered is the advice that this Parliament ought to have in its possession, and is the advice on which it will make a judgment about this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

That advice tendered on whatever day is relevant to this Parliament in making an assessment as to how the passage of this legislation will proceed between the two Houses and what amendments might or might not be acceptable to the two Houses. The point I make is that if in a week's time we are going to have to address this legislation, surely we are entitled to the advice from the public watchdog, the independent statutory authority-the Human Rights Commissioner-and to know what his attitude is. We are not asking for a Cabinet document. It is not a memorandum specifically from one of the officers of the Minister; it concerns advice forwarded over a period of time to the Minister from the Human Rights Commission, the public watchdog, on behalf of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is why this advice is important, why the issue is important, and why it is important to this Parliament to have that advice now so that we can consider it in considering the legislation about to come before the Parliament. The denial of that information to the Parliament, on which it can make a value judgment, is denying the Parliament the opportunity to look at what is clearly important and fundamental advice to the Government on a very important and fundamental piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's only excuse for not presenting that advice-and it went to some length to tell us-was that it did not have to present that advice. I note Senator Ray's comments earlier wherein he said that, if the motion were passed, his advice to the Minister would be not to table it. `It is not enforceable. Go to Crete. Do not worry about it for the next week or 10 days'. That is the advice that Senator Ray is proposing, so from those comments I assume-and I hope that it is not right-that, if the motion happens to be passed by this Senate, then the Government will perhaps accept that advice and not table it. If the Government were to proceed with the course of action suggested by Senator Ray, that would be a very serious matter. This advice demonstrates the concern of the Government about this advice, and how it undermines the thrust of its legislation. Therefore, it does not want to have that advice out now. It does not want its legislation undermined. It does not want the truth out about its legislative proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that, by all means available to the Government, it is going to attempt to suppress this advice that has been tendered over the past month or two by the Human Rights Commissioner. I commend the motion to the House. I trust the Senate will acknowledge that this issue is fundamentally important to Australia-not only now, but also for our future-and that Mr Burdekin's advice is important. It is his advice as the public watchdog that we should, in my view, be entitled to see. It is important that we have it now because the Government is bringing the legislation on in a week's time and is applying the guillotine in another place to the passage of that legislation. For all those reasons, I trust that the Senate will support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to reiterate the fact that the Government opposes the motion before the chamber. We oppose it on two grounds, the first of which has been substantially canvassed already in this place. It is the long-held view of the Government-both this Government and former governments-that it is untenable for governments to be forced to publicly release advice and other forms of consultation. Already I have referred to Odgers on this issue. We have referred to eminent Prime Ministers-I referred to Sir Robert Menzies and my colleague the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) mentioned Mr Harold Holt-who have also reinforced that attitude. I do not think I need to reiterate that now. The basic point is that the decision is up to government; it is privilege of the Executive to decide what documents should or should not be tabled and that is a position to which I adhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to this document or any other document, my view is that, even if the Senate were to pass the motion tonight, I would make an assessment of that document and then make a decision as to whether it should be tabled. It is not up to the Senate to decide-that has been pretty well established. Even in your ruling this evening, Mr Deputy President, you made the point that there is a discretion for the Minister to decide whether to comply; I think those were your words. That reinforces the position I have put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> It is even more important in that we are talking about documents which Senator Olsen believes were tendered to the Government before the proposals were formulated. The Bill was not formulated on the date on which the documents that Senator Olsen requests are supposed to have been sent. In fact, the Bill was not formulated until early May.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I do not want to labour this particular point for very long, because as I say, it has been canvassed already. I reiterate the point I made earlier that there are mechanisms for the disclosure of documents. The Senate and Senate committees have deliberated on those mechanisms; freedom of information legislation was the product of that and I suggest that that legislation provides the legal framework for the release of documents. In closing on this point, it is a long-held principle that it is up to the Government to decide what documents are or are not disclosed. In this respect, regardless of the resolution of the Senate, the Government will consider the document in question and decide what to do with it accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is rather ironic that the basic principle expressed by Senator Olsen goes to the question of human rights and freedom of speech. It is quite ironic that it comes from the Opposition side of the Parliament. As I have said many times over recent weeks, it has been that side of Parliament which has consistently, in this forum and outside, opposed measures to entrench, either through constitutional amendment or by legislation, the protection of basic individual rights in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have to go through a long record but, for the sake of interest, I go briefly to examples in recent years. In particular, let us look at the body we are talking about tonight, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This Commission was put in place to implement a covenant signed by the Whitlam Government and ratified by the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Once in opposition, the coalition lost its interest in supporting human rights. In 1985-86, the Opposition vehemently opposed this Government's attempt through Bill of Rights legislation to entrench the covenant in law. It was this coalition which opposed the creation of the new Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1986. The Commission was responsible for monitoring Australia's observance of our obligations under the covenant. Is it not ironic that Opposition senators, who are still committed to abolishing the role of Mr Brian Burdekin, to abolishing the Commission, come in here and look to that Commission-in some sort of fantasy that Senator Olsen seems to be involving himself in-and see it as an arbiter of human rights?</PARA>
<PARA> If it is so important in entrenching and protecting human rights in this country, why do Senator Hill and Senator Olsen not change their policy? Why do they not support its existence, its continuation? They have had a policy of opposing it as a creation for a good part of five years and they still have that policy. So they should not come in here with utter hypocrisy and claim that we should entrust our legislative framework to the Human Rights Commissioner when they want to abolish him and his role. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just that. We have tried to entrench human rights through basic freedoms in our Constitution, through constitutional amendment-amendments which were proposed and endorsed by a very broad ranging committee of Australian citizens, including the former Liberal Premier of Victoria, Sir Rupert Hamer. The Constitutional Commission proposed a number of amendments to our Constitution to protect some basic rights: rights to freedom of religion; a right to vote; the right to one vote one value; the right to trial by jury; fair compensation and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Who opposed them? Who opposed them stridently in this place by way of filibuster? Who opposed them out in the electorate? Who led to their defeat in terms of their potential to be enshrined in our Australian Constitution? It was the Opposition. The Opposition's attitude has not changed. The degree of duplicity that has been shown over the years by the Opposition continues. Only last weekend we saw a press statement put out by Senator Olsen, of all people, wishing once again to mislead the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> What did he say in his press statement? He said two things. The Government's Political Broadcast and Political Disclosures Bill was `a trick' he said. It is not true disclosure because we are not covering our trade union-I think the word is in there somewhere- `mates'. </PARA>

The trade union movement has had that obligation for years. Those fees will be even more transparent under this proposal. They have been transparent in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what about the other point of trickery? Very much in line with what has been presented tonight, Senator Olsen says-and I must admit, he is a new boy, so he may not have known about this-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>We are determined to ensure that Senator Robert Ray's statements to the Senate in November 1983 and again on 19th February 1988 when he said, `with regard to Disclosure, there will always be a way round'---</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Olsen says that the Opposition will make sure they `do not become law'. The reason why there has been `a way round' the last few years has been the trenchant opposition from the other side. Opposition senators are the ones who rendered ineffective the spot audit provisions in the legislation. As recently as 18 months ago the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters said:</PARA>
<PARA>Spot audits on a random basis at the whim of the Commissioner, however, would introduce a further increment of bureaucratic power that would be intolerable to democracy. The purpose of such spot audits,-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is a real gem-</PARA>
<PARA>as expressed by the Commissioner would be to enable the AEC to say with a clearer conscience and more confidence that `everything appears to be satisfactory'. </PARA>
<PARA>What did Opposition senators' comrades say?</PARA>
<PARA>This is not sufficient reason to trifle with free, democratic processes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the reason why we have the disclosure legislation that we have now. The Government made it very clear at the start of this process that we recognise and respect the international covenant on civil and political rights. I have also made it very clear from the start that we have had very clear advice from the Attorney-General's Department-our advisers-that we are within the ambits of that covenant. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite easy for the Opposition to quote in here and outside article 19 (2) of that covenant. It is a very specific and general provision. But there is 19 (3). Article 19 (2) provides and guarantees the rights to freedom of expression. This right is not and never has been absolute. When it comes to things like censorship legislation, banning videos, and things as trifling as telephone indexes, it is the Opposition that recognises that there can be an exception on the grounds of public health or morals in that case. Article 19 (3) of the covenant says that we can make exceptions for the protection of national security or of public order. From the start, we have recognised the steps taken--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. The point I was making was that we believe our ban on political advertising is a proportionate and necessary response to these problems. Article 19 is general but it is not absolute and there are quite a number of instances, whether it comes to the airwaves or anywhere else in our society, where the qualifications to that article are spelled out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the advice the Government has received has recognised that steps to prevent corruption or undue influence of the democratic process would fall within the limitation of public order, that being under article 19 (3) of the covenant. There is only one person who actually argues strongly against that and that is `Professor' Olsen, but let me say that the considered view of our advisers is that we fall squarely within that limitation on public order, and we have stated that consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech we stated the Government is satisfied that the proposals are a necessary and proportionate response to the threat of potential corruption and undue influence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Olsen has pointed out that I was a supporter of legislation in 1986, and I in fact support it now. But I am mature enough to understand that there are qualifications in that covenant and I am also advised, very firmly, that what we are doing is within those qualifications. Let me reiterate: all the advice that we have had has recognised that steps taken to prevent corruption or undue influence of the democratic process would fall within the limitation of public order. So we are satisfied that the ban, for the stated purposes, does not constitute a breach of potential corruption of our obligations under international law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is some cynicism about this particular point-the proportionate and necessary response to the problem. But the threat of corruption and undue influence was demonstrated not only in the report of the Joint Standing Committee but it has been recognised by the Fitzgerald inquiry and by Commissioner Roden of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. They have referred to the threat in their reports and I do not have to go through those reports once again to indicate their level of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> There are royal commissions currently under way in Tasmania and Western Australia. They are considering related matters. The Saulwick national poll arising out of all that indicated very strongly that 76 per cent of respondents believed political donations were made to buy influence. That is the sort of threat to public order the Government is concerned about and that is the sort of threat we are tackling, and we are tackling that in the only way possible-the only necessary and proportionate response to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to $17m was spent on electronic advertising at the last election. This point should not be missed because it points to the potential threat of corruption and undue influence to our democratic process. We believe that that threat requires an urgent response and we have considered all the options and all the alternatives. We have looked at free time, caps on expenditure and disclosure in itself. Free time and caps on expenditure do have problems. Disclosure on its own does not answer the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Even John Howard, the former Opposition Leader, has made that point-disclosure of its own does not solve the problem. It only addresses one part of the problem. Unless the need for funds is stopped this interrelationship between the corporate sector and government will never be stopped in terms of supplying funds for campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a proportionate response. It is a necessary one. It applies to advertising alone. I do not really have to go on at length on this particular point but what are we talking about? We are talking about advertising. News, current affairs and editorial comment will continue to operate. We are talking about political advertising, a commercial transaction, which members of the Opposition in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on this matter indicated their position on very clearly. They rejected as absurd the assertion that political advertising is socially good. I will not say much more on this. All I will say in conclusion is that we are advised, and we are quite sure, that we are acting within article 19 in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of this particular document that has been asked for tonight, whether the motion is passed or not, I will have to make a decision on the merits of that document as to whether I table it or not. What I will say though is that we are talking about, allegedly, a document that goes to the Government's proposal. Commissioner Burdekin has not advised us on the Bill. He received that late last Thursday night. We are having discussions with him, and I anticipate that we will get some constructive proposals from Commissioner Burdekin during the course of those discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> When I get advice on the Bill, I will sympathetically consider making that available, but of course I will have to take everything into consideration, including the view of the Senate as it may be expressed, but more particularly the advice of the Commissioner and what is embodied in it. I give the undertaking that when that advice on the Bill is received, as opposed to on the proposal, I will sympathetically consider making that available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have listened to some debate supposedly on a motion put forward by Senator Olsen. Much of it has not been relevant, in my view, to the motion, so I think it is important that we know what we are talking about. Senator Olsen wants the Senate to require the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) to table written advice received from Human Rights Commissioner Burdekin dated 20 March referring to a proposal by the Government which subsequently has come before the Parliament in the form of legislation. That legislation came before the Parliament-it was tabled in the House of Representatives-last Thursday, 9 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have noted the Minister's remarks both in his answer to the question today put by Senator Olsen and at the end of his response to Senator Olsen's motion just now. The Minister in answer to the question today commented that Commissioner Burdekin had some difficulties with the Government's proposal, and I think we all read in the newspapers that that was the case. The Minister then went on, as he did just now, to say that now that there is legislation, which Commissioner Burdekin has to hand, there are discussions going on and he expects to receive some advice, and that if he does he will consider making that advice available to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point made by the Minister is one for us to focus on, and that is about the Government's right to make public or not to make public certain documents. I believe that if a government-any government-is to be asked to table documents of advice and to make them public, there needs to be a very strong argument of public interest. Where that is in the public interest, those documents should be made public. Therefore, I listened to Senator Olsen's remarks on that basis. If any government is to be asked under such a blanket standing order as standing order 164 to make documents available, there is a very strong argument of public interest. I believe that when there is advice from an important figure in this discussion, such as Commissioner Burdekin, as I believe there will be, on legislation which we will be considering here, and which will be considered in the House of Representatives prior to that, there could very well be a strong element of public interest in that advice being available to legislators, and through the Senate that might well be able to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from what the Minister has said and from what one has read in the newspapers that there was some adverse reaction by Commissioner Burdekin to the Government's original proposal, I think we can remember that there was an adverse reaction from a great many people to the Government's original proposal. Indeed, there was an adverse reaction from the Opposition, and the decision has been made to reject the Government's proposal for a blanket ban on all political advertising. There was an adverse reaction on that very point also from my own Party and we, too, have made the decision to oppose a blanket ban on all political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are now facing, as Senator Olsen said, is legislation which the Government has gone ahead with, putting a proposal for a blanket ban on political advertising, even though it knows that neither the Australian Democrats nor the Opposition is prepared to support that legislation. Therefore it knows that that legislation will be amended. It is that legislation and the preparation for amendments which I think is the issue-not necessarily the proposal which was floated in a press release with a couple of pages of attachments by the Minister, which led to the public debate and to the decisions already made by the Opposition and by the Democrats. That has been done. It has gone; it is not relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> What is relevant is the Bill that was introduced in the House of Representatives last Thursday night. I submit to the Minister that it is relevant and of interest. Unless he can argue for some reason or other when he does get the advice and information from the Commissioner on the Bill--</PARA>

I find it difficult, first, to find whether that is relevant; and, secondly, to understand how Opposition senators can say that some advice is the same as advice which the Minister tells us he has not yet received. I do not see a strong public interest argument. My Party has made up its mind on the blanket ban; the Liberal Party has made up its mind on the blanket ban. What we are now required to do is look at the legislation and decide on amendments. I would value the advice of the Commissioner for Human Rights, if he has a view.

First, I was disappointed by the response by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), who acknowledged that the motion was in order and acknowledged that the Senate can pass a motion calling upon a Minister to take a course of action but said that he, the Minister, will make a judgment as to whether he wants to comply with that resolution of the Senate.

In telephone discussions that I have had with the Human Rights Commissioner this week, he has clearly indicated to me that the advice he has tendered is consistent with the advice he gave the Minister on Tuesday night and is continuing to hold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that in a telephone conversation with me today Mr Burdekin indicated that the advice he has tendered to the Government will be consistent with any subsequent advice that he might be giving to the Government. Therefore, it is consistent; therefore, it has not changed; and therefore, it is relevant because it contains the arguments that I put earlier when supporting the motion as to why this matter is important, why Mr Burdekin's advice is important, and why it is important for that advice to be available to us now. I do not think that the Minister's response deflected from that. In fact, this evening the Minister's response went on to disclosures and my press release. I am rather pleased that he has taken some notice of a press release that I put out. In other words, he went off and drew a total red herring in regard to the motion before the Senate as it relates to the advice given by the Human Rights Commissioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister did not have substantive argument or rebuttal, so he used the old ploy of going off on a tangent and being irrelevant. The Minister quoted article 19.3 of the International Covenant. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in the present Covenant may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms recognised herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided in the present Covenant.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Government is proposing to restrict freedom further. Article 19.3 clearly identifies that that cannot be done. I am absolutely sure that Mr Burdekin's advice to the Government said that article 19.3 does not support what the Government is, in fact, putting in place. </PARA>
<PARA> A motion such as this is not moved lightly. It is not moved regularly, as clearly demonstrated by the debate that took place earlier in this chamber, which recognises the importance of this issue before the chamber. I just want to re-emphasise the point that if we are expected to debate an issue of such fundamental importance to Australians, the advice that has been put forward ought to be available for Australians to make a value judgment on the Government's direction. The denial of that right is merely to restrict the debate, merely to ensure--</PARA>

<PARA>STUDENT ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973. The Act constitutes the statutory basis for the Austudy scheme and provides a debt management regime for student assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax file numbers</PARA>
<PARA> A major provision in the Bill is to provide that assistance will be paid only when students have provided their tax file numbers to the Department. The requirement will also apply to parents or spouses if the means test applies to the parents or spouse. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will help ensure that assistance goes to those genuinely in financial need. It is part of a broader package involving data matching of client records between the Departments administering income maintenance schemes. The package has already been substantially implemented by the enactment of the Data Matching (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 and amendments to the Social Security Act 1947. </PARA>
<PARA>Restructuring the late payment charge</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also addresses the problem of delays in the repaying of student assistance overpayments. The Bill will restructure the existing late payment charge to provide for a flat charge of $100; this reflects the fact that the cost of recovering an overpayment is independent of the amount involved. In addition, the Bill will provide that interest will run from the date when the debtor is notified of the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise that the charges for late payment are designed to encourage debtors to repay promptly. The late payment charge and interest do not apply if the debtor repays the money within three months of being contacted by the Department or arranges repayment by instalments. Additionally, the Minister and prescribed Departmental officers can remit the charge or interest in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Assistance Review Tribunal</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will require the Student Assistance Review Tribunal to give written reasons within 10 working days of handing down its decision. This change seeks to address concerns by the Administrative Review Council about delays in resolving appeals. </PARA>
<PARA>Ministerial determinations</PARA>
<PARA> When the Student Assistance Act was last amended, the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills noted that Ministerial determinations under the Student Assistance Act are not subject to Parliamentary review. The Government accepts the Committee's concern on this point, and the Bill will rectify this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Immunity of student assistance files from subpoenas</PARA>
<PARA> Another provision in the Bill will protect personal information in student assistance files from subpoenas. The proposal parallels a provision in the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Phasing out of Post-graduate Awards</PARA>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Act at present provides for the granting of Postgraduate Awards. These were competitive awards for study in Masters and Doctoral courses. They have now been phased out, being replaced by a scheme of institution-based Australian postgraduate awards funded under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The Bill accordingly will delete references to the former awards from the Student Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, the provision of tax file numbers is part of a broader package involving data comparison; the package should lead to estimated savings for student assistance programs of $7m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Restructuring the late payment charge is expected to generate revenue of up to $1m in a full year, though the main impact will be to encourage debtors to repay promptly or arrange repayments by instalments. </PARA>
<PARA> The other provisions in the Bill will have no significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill, which gives additional details on the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL 1990</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to make three important changes to the Copyright Act 1968. The first will enable unrestricted commercial importation of non-pirate copies of all new books appearing in the future, other than those first published in Australia or first published simultaneously in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment will suspend a copyright owner's control over importation of non-pirate copies of books first published in Australia, or first published simultaneously in Australia and overseas, when the owner cannot supply copies for more than 90 days. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment will allow the importation of single copies of non-pirate copies of books at any time to fill documented orders from customers for their private use. </PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA> For a number of years there have been complaints from some Australian booksellers and from consumers that the right of copyright owners to control the commercial importation of their books has restricted the availability of imported books and inflated their prices. In 1983 the Government therefore asked the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) to report on whether the provisions of the Copyright Act establishing the copyright owners' control over importation should be modified. </PARA>
<PARA> In a report in September 1988, the CLRC recommended relaxation of the importation provisions where the copyright owner could not make copies available within a reasonable time. The CLRC's recommendations received substantial support, and prompted widespread discussion and media coverage. In making its recommendations, the CLRC made the comment that there had been insufficient evidence before it to determine the question of the effect of the present legislation on the price of books in Australia. Consequently, the then Minister for Consumer Affairs decided to refer the question of book prices to the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). In an interim report in September 1989, the PSA concluded that Australian book prices were higher than those in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. It recommended total repeal of the copyright owner's right of control over importation of books, subject to 2 exceptions, namely, Australian authored books published separately in Australia and pirated copies. </PARA>
<PARA> The PSA's proposals were strongly supported by consumer groups, media commentators and many booksellers. However they were opposed by authors, publishers and other booksellers, who said that wholesale repeal of copyright owners' control over imports would seriously damage authors' incomes and Australian publishers' viability. They also asserted that the proposed singling out of Australian books would be inconsistent with Australia's obligations under the Berne Copyright Convention. They urged adoption, instead, of the CLRC recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Possible Options for Reform</PARA>
<PARA> Given that both reports recommended changes to the importation provisions of the Copyright Act and that all protagonists in the debate favoured adoption at least of the CLRC's recommendations, there was an overwhelming case for modifying copyright owners' control over imports. The PSA's findings on the comparison of Australian and overseas book prices strongly suggested that a more fundamental reform than the CLRC's recommendations was needed. My predecessor interviewed representatives of a number of interests with various views on this issue. It became apparent from comments received on the PSA report that adoption in full of its recommendations was likely to give rise to a number of adverse consequences. I shall summarise some of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, while in world terms a reasonably substantial consumer of books, is nevertheless a small player in the world English language book market, the bigger players being the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. If all restrictions were removed on the importation of books, the influx of cheap overseas books produced for much bigger domestic markets would threaten economic loss to both Australian publishers and Australian authors. While consumers might benefit from such abolition by gaining access to the cheapest priced overseas books, they as well as Australian authors and publishers would suffer from the resultant decline in distinctively Australian literature. </PARA>
<PARA> The question whether the presently available range of books would improve or decline on introduction of an open market is hotly disputed. However, there seems sufficient doubt to question seriously whether there would be any overall improvement in present distribution arrangements. Finally, it is noteworthy that two of the bigger players in the world English language, the United Kingdom and Canada, have recently introduced new copyright laws reaffirming copyright owners' control over imports. In the case of Canada, protection of local culture was an important consideration. In those circumstances it seemed foolhardy for Australia, given its size in the world English language book market, to unilaterally expose its writers and publishers to competition from which writers and publishers in the larger English language countries remain protected. The Government concluded that complete repeal of the importation provisions would pose too great a risk to Australian literature in general and to both Australian authors and Australian publishers in particular. We therefore looked for a solution short of complete repeal. From the discussions and submissions that my predecessor and I and my Department had, a solution emerged which now finds its expression in the Bill I am introducing. I acknowledge the value of the contributions made by the various interests who took part in the discussions and made the submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>Benefits of the Reforms</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill, owners of the copyright in overseas books which are not first published in Australia will lose the right to control imports of legitimate copies of the book into Australia, that is, to exclusively supply the Australian market. It should be noted that books `first published in Australia' will include books first published abroad that are subsequently published in Australia within 30 days. This is because it is already so provided in section 29(5) of the Copyright Act, and the Berne Convention states that a work shall be considered as having been published simultaneously in several countries if published in two or more countries within 30 days of first publication. </PARA>
<PARA> The PSA proposal for singling out Australian authors for preferential treatment could risk censure as contravening the requirements of the Berne Convention to give national treatment to authors of all other Convention countries. The Bill avoids this problem by not distinguishing between books according to the nationality of their authors.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment in the Bill will mean an open market in Australia for new books not first published in Australia, as defined, and thus their early availability here. As a result, the cheapest editions will be able to be brought in and, consequently, there could be some marginal downward pressure on book prices generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Owners of copyright in books first published in Australia will, as now, have control over imports. In conformity with the Berne Convention this will apply regardless of whether the author is Australian or foreign. However, to the extent that foreign authors or copyright owners will seek to preserve their control over imports by publishing in Australia within 30 days of first publication abroad, Australian publishers may stand to gain extra business. Australian consumers will stand to gain from the resulting earlier availability of the books concerned. As regards availability, Australian consumers will gain whether the overseas book is published within 30 days in Australia or not. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Authors</PARA>
<PARA> Australian authors who publish first in Australia will retain their exclusive rights. That is, the changes to the importation provisions will permit Australian authors to deal with their copyright as they do now. The approach adopted by the Bill will overcome concerns expressed about importation of cheap, low quality copies, the remaindering of overseas copies in Australia with a consequent loss of revenue for authors and the so-called devaluation of copyright. Authors at the start of their careers need not fear that prospective publishers will be justified seeking world rights, and can expect that there will continue to be opportunities to have their works accepted for publication to meet the local Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Booksellers</PARA>
<PARA> Booksellers as well as consumers have been concerned about high prices and delays in availability in Australia of stocks of new overseas books. They have not been able to meet legitimate consumer demand at a time when public interest is high, resulting in a loss of potential sales. Under the new law a bookseller will have the right to import directly, for commercial purposes, books which are first published in a foreign country and not in Australia. Just as importantly, the amendments will enable a bookseller to import books first published in Australia where the copyright owner is unable to supply the books to the bookseller within 90 days of a written order. Moreover, the bookseller will be able to continue to import until such time as the copyright owner is able to fill the order, that is, is able to resupply the local market. Honourable members should particularly note that this right to go offshore when the copyright owner is unable to maintain supplies will apply to all existing titles as well as titles published after the amendments come into operation. Where the copyright owner has first published a title in Australia by release of hardback copies and a paperback edition is released overseas, a bookseller can import paperbacks 90 days after placing an order for them, unless the copyright owner can supply that order within that time. It is not sufficient if, in response to the order, the copyright owner offers hardbacks.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as part of the CLRC's recommendations, the Bill will introduce the right of booksellers to import a book at any time-regardless of its place of first publication or availability from the copyright owner in Australia-on the written order of a customer for that customer's personal use. As honourable members may be aware, it is permissible for any person now to bring a book into Australia or order a book from overseas if it is not done for the purpose of commercial distribution in Australia. The changes to the legislation will mean that, if the Australian rightholder of a new overseas title wishes to maintain his or her exclusive right to supply the Australian market, he or she will be required to publish simultaneously in Australia and to maintain adequate stocks of copies, including paperbacks. Otherwise, there will be an open market for the book, either generally after 30 days from overseas publication-if there is no publication in Australia within that time-or, for those booksellers whose orders the copyright owner has been unable to fill for more than 90 days, until supply from that source is restored. This will provide booksellers with speedier access to stocks and, in some cases, enable them to provide more cheaply priced books. </PARA>
<PARA>Publishers</PARA>
<PARA> The changes introduced by the Bill also accommodate the legitimate needs of book publishers. They will be able to protect their investment in the Australian market provided they supply it promptly. It must be recognised that the investment made by publishers and their contribution to the Australian economy and its work force are substantial. Furthermore, the changes will enable publishers to continue to support authors whose works are destined primarily for the Australian market. This is important for Australian culture.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Consumers</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian consumer has, in some cases, been denied access to overseas works as the copyright owner has, for one reason or another, not seen fit to supply the local market. In other cases, the time taken to supply the market has been unduly slow. The changes will ensure that the consumer will have early access to overseas works as there will be an open market if the copyright owner does not supply it. </PARA>
<PARA> This is very important in the case of educational and technological titles when unavailability denies access to information which is essential to maintain a competitive position or `knowledge equality'. In the case of price, there has been considerable concern about the price of works and, in particular, about the inability to purchase lower-priced paperbacks. The changes effected by the Bill overcome the problem of access to paperbacks as these may be imported if the copyright owner does not choose to supply them. In the case of new overseas titles not published in Australia within 30 days, consumers stand to gain the benefit of the cheapest overseas editions. Review of Legislation</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government thus believes that it has achieved a balanced reform in the amendments, it recognises that the amendments are a substantial departure from the existing law. Accordingly, the Government has decided that their effect should be reviewed after they have been in operation for a time. It is proposed that after three years from their commencement an appropriate reference will be given to the Prices Surveillance Authority to determine the impact of the amendments on book prices, which was one of the original concerns giving rise to the reform moves. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments effected by this Bill will have no direct impact on Commonwealth expenditure. However, the Bill is likely to lead to reduction in prices of some books supplied to Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA> It contains measures to extend normal mainland Australian taxation arrangements to the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also contains amendments that relate to the measures enacted by this Government last year to deal with the avoidance of Australian tax through the use of controlled foreign companies and trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will give effect to the changes the Treasurer announced on 13 December 1990 to the taxation arrangements for foreign employment income derived by Australian residents. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will greatly simplify a complex part of the tax system that affects individual Australians working overseas and will benefit in particular Australian missionaries and volunteer aid workers engaged in foreign service in a country that does not tax their income. </PARA>
<PARA> Following consultations with the finance industry, measures are included to give effect to minor concessional modifications to the thin capitalisation provisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the land degradation provisions to give effect to the measures announced in the 1990-91 Budget arising from the review of Landcare objectives are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also provide for taxpayers to be able to claim a deduction for both current and capital expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1991 in the course of rehabilitating mining or quarrying sites. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to various provisions relating to the quotation of a tax file number for the investment phase and to simplify the provisions of the Act relating to pensions, benefits and allowances are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will extend the taxation relief presently available for securities transferred between lenders and borrowers under securities lending arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The gift provisions of the income tax law and the law in relation to the assessment and payment provisions for companies and superannuation funds will be amended. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as part of its continuing commitment to the fight against organised crime, the Government has decided to extend access to taxation information to three law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Cocos (Keeling) Islands</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will give legislative force to certain taxation measures that are part of a number of reforms to be introduced under the Government's commitment to give effect to the vote by the Cocos Malay people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to integrate with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, under the proposed changes, residents of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands will, from 1 July 1991, be subject to Australian tax obligations in respect of presently exempt income and capital gains. In addition, previously exempt fringe benefits will become taxable from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes, the main features of which I will briefly outline, mirror those set out in a Memorandum of Understanding that was signed by the Prime Minister and representatives of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands community on 7 March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Personal income tax is to be phased in so that tax in respect of previously exempt income and capital gains will be reduced by 50 per cent during the 1991-92 income year. Full rates of personal tax will first apply to such income and capital gains in the 1992-93 income year. As Cocos (Keeling) Islands residents already have access to Medicare benefits, normal rates of the Medicare levy will apply from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Full rates of company tax will apply to previously exempt income and capital gains of Cocos (Keeling) Islands resident companies in the 1991-92 income year. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital gains tax rules will now apply to all assets disposed of on or after 1 July 1991 by residents of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. However, in respect of previously exempt assets, only the gain which has accrued on or after 1 July 1991 will be subject to the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A consequential effect of the proposed amendments is that residents of Norfolk Island will, in the 1991-92 and later income years, be liable to tax on income or capital gains derived from sources in the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the same way as they are presently liable to tax on income or gains from sources in mainland Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue from these changes is estimated at $260,000 in 1991-92 and $750,000 in 1992-93, although this will be offset by other aspects of the integration package for the Islands. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Source Income</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments in this area reflect the Government's willingness to act on proposals for the smoother implementation of these measures. In this vein, the Bill will exempt from Australian tax certain dividends paid by a controlled foreign company from income that has been taxed under another country's accruals tax measures, and will clarify that distributions from non-resident trusts that qualify for the rebate of tax on winding up will not be subject to the interest charge. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, I must also emphasise this Government's determination to ensure that these measures have their intended effect in countering tax avoidance. Some of the amendments will therefore streamline the provisions that were enacted to deal with tax avoidance through disguised distributions of profits, while others will ensure that offshore money lending businesses cannot claim excessive deductions for bad debts. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation of Foreign Employment Income</PARA>
<PARA> Under present law an Australian resident person working overseas on certain approved projects, or otherwise as an employee, may be entitled to a full exemption from Australian tax as long as the foreign service is not less than 12 months, or a partial exemption for periods between 3 and 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The law also makes the exemptions subject to the tax treatment of the income in the other country, and require complex calculations to take the exempt income into account when taxing other income of the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considered several representations concerning difficulties arising under those provisions, including the position of Australian missionaries and volunteer aid workers who generally receive only a modest amount of remuneration and were often disadvantaged by the existing rules. </PARA>
<PARA> I am therefore pleased to say that the measures proposed in this Bill will provide a more generous level of tax treatment to these volunteers who contribute to Australia's foreign aid program by working abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government concluded also that the variable tests and complex calculations under the existing law should be rationalised in accordance with the Government's announced policy of simplification of the income tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will therefore amend the income tax law to:</PARA>
<PARA> * extend the exemption in some circumstances where the foreign earnings are exempt from tax in the other country;</PARA>
<PARA> * reduce, from 12 to 3 months, the length of time a person must work overseas to qualify for full exemption (a consequential amendment will give a similar result under the fringe benefits tax law; and</PARA>
<PARA> * apply an average rate rather than a marginal rate to the taxpayer's non-exempt income and thus effectively reduce the Australian tax on that income. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will apply to foreign earnings derived on or after 1 July 1990 and are estimated to cost about $3 million in 1991-92 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Thin Capitalisation</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes minor modifications to the thin capitalisation provisions of the law which operate to limit interest deductions for Australian companies or other entities on borrowings from related foreign sources. </PARA>
<PARA> The first modification will exclude from the definition of foreign debt of an Australian company debentures eligible for the section 128F interest withholding tax exemption which are temporarily held by a foreign related party for the purpose of distribution overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other minor technical modifications will extend the existing thin capitalisation concession for a foreign owned resident holding company which partly owns a resident bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue effect of these cannot be estimated, but is not considered to be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>Land degradation</PARA>
<PARA> The deduction available to primary producers for capital expenditures designed to prevent land degradation is to be extended to taxpayers who derive business income from rural land. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment will allow both primary producers and rural businesses to claim a deduction for fences erected to separate different land classes in accordance with an approved farm plan designed primarily and principally to prevent the degradation of land, whether or not it is already degraded. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments, which see to fruition an undertaking given by this Government in its July 1989 Statement on the Environment, will have effect, broadly, from 22 August 1990 at an estimated cost of $2.7 million in 1990-91, $4.2 million in 1991-92 and $5.0 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA>Mine site rehabilitation</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the Government's 1990-91 Budget announcement that current and capital rehabilitation expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1991 is to be immediately deductible against income from any source. </PARA>
<PARA> Rehabilitation expenditure will qualify for the deduction where it is incurred on a site where exploration, mining or quarrying operations have been conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional measures in the Bill will ensure that the rehabilitation process is treated as part of a mining operation for the purpose of deductions available for housing and welfare and plant or articles under both the general and petroleum mining divisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the amendment is $10 million per annum in 1992-93 and later years. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax File Number Changes</PARA>
<PARA> These changes, which will have a negligible effect on the revenue, are in response to representations from investment bodies and investors and will lessen the administrative burden associated with the reporting requirements of the tax file number arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The law will be restated to make it clear that where a person makes an investment in a capacity as trustee he or she may quote the tax file number of the trust estate even though the investment is not held in the name of the trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the quotation rules will be streamlined where a person invests in an investment body through an interposed entity that is a solicitor or a body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA> Where all of the primary investors are identified in the investment made on their behalf by an interposed entity, the amended quotation rules will allow each primary investor to quote his or her tax file number to the investment body directly. </PARA>
<PARA> If all of the primary investors are not identified, the interposed entity will be able to quote a reference number-to be called the ``investment body remitter number''-instead of its own tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments proposed by this Bill will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to vary the date on which investment bodies must remit amounts withheld. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the existing exemption from quoting a tax file number where the income being paid is subject to non-resident withholding tax is to be tightened. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption will apply only where the investment body paying the income is actually required to withhold the tax, or would have been so required but for certain exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally in this regard, the Bill will remove the requirement-which is technically defective-that a deduction be made where a tax file number is not quoted for certain deferred interest securities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to introduce new rules in the Budget Sittings to deal with such investments. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensions, benefits and allowances</PARA>
<PARA> A project to improve the readability of social security and veterans' entitlements legislation by the use of a clear English drafting style and format is nearing completion and required consequential amendments to the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> In giving effect to these changes in this Bill, the opportunity has been taken to simplify the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act that exempt from tax certain pensions, benefits and allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> The new legislation is intended to reflect existing policy and, accordingly, will have no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>Securities Lending Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> The existing concession for securities lending arrangements will be extended to remove the restriction that currently denies relief if distributions are made or rights or options are issued or exercised during a borrowing period. Relief will be available where lenders receive any such distributions, rights, options, new securities or a compensatory payment. The allowable borrowing period will also be extended to less than twelve months. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments follow consultations with the Stock Exchange and other parties involved in introducing improved settlement procedures in the securities industry. They were foreshadowed when the Government introduced the concession last year, and will have no effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Company and Superannuation Fund Self-assessment</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to correct a technical deficiency in the assessment and payment provisions for companies and superannuation funds that commenced to apply in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision of tax information</PARA>
<PARA> Access to tax information is already given to certain other bodies including all Australian police forces, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the National Crime Authority and the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to communicate, in specified circumstances, taxation information to authorised officers of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the Independent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales and the New South Wales Crime Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner will be allowed to disclose taxation information to the authorised officers where he considers that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence-that is, an indictable offence-has been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> He may also release information relating to a person convicted of a serious offence for evidence purposes for a post conviction proceeds of crime proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements of secrecy applying to taxation officers and other persons privy to confidential taxation information extend to officers to whom taxation information is to be communicated. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA> The gift provisions of the income tax law are amended to reflect a change in name of the College of Nursing, Australia, to the Royal College of Nursing, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Hungary and Australia and Kiribati. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will insert the text of those agreements into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as schedules to that Act. The agreement with Hungary was signed on 29 November 1990 and that with Kiribati on 25 March 1991. Details of each agreement were announced and copies were made publicly available at the time of signature. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements allocate taxing rights over all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and Hungary and Australia and Kiribati respectively. The agreements substantially accord with other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Conclusion of the agreement with Hungary reflects Australia's support for that country's decision to adopt democratic structures and move towards a market economy, whilst negotiation of the agreement with Kiribati is in keeping with Australia's recognition of the development aspirations of regional developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As with Australia's other modern tax treaties with such countries, the agreement with Kiribati provides for ``tax sparing'' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by Kiribati under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. This means that where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives and is subject to Australian tax, a tax credit is to be allowed by Australia as if the Kiribati tax forgone had been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> By this means, the development incentives will retain their attraction for Australian investors and allow them to compete on favourable terms with investors from other countries, as they will not be negated by Australian tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Each of the respective agreements will enter into force when diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that the last of the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in the respective countries has been completed. The enactment of this Bill will complete the processes required of Australia for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and the treaty partner countries, but it is not possible to predict their effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. It also amends a number of other enactments, which are, with one exception, consequential upon the amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act. The exception concerns certain machinery amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. The Bill also incorporates amendments made in the other House. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill are explained in detail in the accompanying explanatory memorandum. I will, therefore, confine my comments to the more noteworthy of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 are contained in Part 2 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Particularly noteworthy are the provisions relating to the calculation, approval and payment of contributions or ``premiums'' by Commonwealth Departments and authorities for compensation cover for their staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 also contains amendments of a minor policy nature, and amendments designed to restore the original effect of the Act in certain areas. These amendments are mainly technical in nature and contribute to the Act's more effective operation. Some are of particular assistance to claimants under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees, commonly referred to as Comcare, was established in July 1988 to effectively manage the Commonwealth public sector workers' compensation function. Comcare operates under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. This legislation introduced income related benefits and emphasised Comcare's role in the prevention of workplace injury and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also introduced Comcare's premium system which commenced on 1 July 1989. The premium system is a key element in Comcare's strategy to control the cost of workers' compensation in the Commonwealth sector by making agencies financially accountable for compensation costs as well as providing them with incentives to develop effective accident prevention and rehabilitation strategies. The scheme is fully funded. That is, the premiums received by Comcare in a particular year are calculated so that they cover the full cost of injuries sustained during that year over the life of those claims. The premiums are also responsive to changes in an agency's performance from year to year. Managers are financially accountable for the full cost of injuries occurring in any year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes new provisions dealing with the calculation, approval and payment of premiums to improve and streamline these procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, the new premium system is similar in structure to the existing provisions of the Act dealing with the calculation, approval and payment of contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, however, the Act is too restrictive and inflexible to accommodate the financial concerns of both Comcare and Departments and authorities. The proposed amendments expand and clarify the existing features of this system and set out the procedures involved in the calculation, approval, review and payment of premiums in a more logical and complete way. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed new provisions Comcare is to reduce a premium if payment is made early or increase a premium if payment is deferred or made by instalment. This will maintain a fully-funded scheme and will also enable Departments and authorities to nominate methods of payment which are best suited to their needs, whilst providing an incentive for early payment and compensating Comcare for deferred payment or payment by instalment. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the changes to the provisions relating to premiums, which I am confident will benefit all participants, the Bill makes a number of amendments of a technical nature. Currently Comcare may only invest temporarily surplus funds in excess of $100 000 with the approval of the Minister. This is an unnecessarily inconvenient situation. The proposed amendments will remedy this problem and operate retrospectively to the date of commencement of the Act to ensure that past transactions cannot be called into doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments included in the Bill are intended to improve the operation of the Act by clarifying certain transitional provisions and correcting some errors and omissions. The need for the amendments has become apparent since the commencement of the Act on 1 December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, an amendment is included which will ensure that employees who were entitled to compensation under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 will remain entitled to compensation under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 without having to satisfy the liability tests in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment will give the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the discretion to make an order for the payment of a claimant's costs in certain proceedings brought by the Commonwealth under the Act. The Bill will also remove any possible doubt concerning the validity of such orders for costs by the AAT in the past as well as past payments of claimants' costs by the Commonwealth or a determining authority in the absence of such an order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also allow certain Territory owned corporations to be declared to be covered by the Act. This amendment has been requested by the Chief Minister of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments relating to premiums have no financial implications. The remaining amendments will not have a significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes a number of amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and consequential amendments to other Acts. These are contained in Parts 3 and 4 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal function of the Remuneration Tribunal is to inquire into and recommend or determine the salaries of specified categories of office holders including Ministers of State, senior public office holders and the federal judiciary. The Tribunal comprises 3 part-time members appointed by the Governor-General for periods not exceeding 5 years. It is particularly important that there be flexibility to appoint Tribunal members with appropriate knowledge and experience, including an appreciation of current industrial relations issues and government administration. Currently, however, a person who has been a member of Parliament, a public servant, a holder of a public office, a holder of federal judicial office or a holder of an office with the status of a judge of a federal court is precluded from appointment to the Tribunal for a period of 7 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing 7 year disqualification period has created difficulties in finding replacement members of the Tribunal with the necessary skills and experience to enable them to operate effectively. Members of the tribunal are required to have regard to the wage fixing principles of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and therefore need to be cognisant of the principles of contemporary wage fixing arrangements. Accordingly, a more flexible provision is required. An amendment is therefore proposed to the Act to reduce the disqualification period from 7 years to one year. The independence and impartiality of the Remuneration Tribunal must, however, be preserved. It is, therefore, proposed that the reduction in the disqualification period be balanced by the insertion of a new disclosure of conflict of interest provision. The provision will require a member of the Tribunal to disclose any pecuniary or other interests which could conflict with the proper performance of the member's functions in relation to Tribunal proceedings. The provision will reflect the position, which I am sure, would quite properly be taken by a Tribunal member if he or she was in such a position. In view of the changes proposed to the disqualification provision it is desirable to make explicit what might formerly be considered to have been implicit. Such provisions are commonly found in Commonwealth legislation relating to other federal tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Tribunal members, the disclosure is to be made in writing to the Chairman of the Tribunal who may direct the member to sit on the matter. In the case of the Chairman, the disclosure is to be made to the Minister. Where this is done, the Chairman is not to sit on the matter concerned unless the Minister consents. The difference between the positions of the members and of the Chairman is to ensure that there can be no perception that the Minister has the capacity to disqualify the Chairman unjustifiably or interfere in the conduct of the Tribunal's business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes amendments to extend the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine the recreation leave entitlements of full-time holders of certain senior public offices, on the same basis as that of fixed-term senior public servants. The amendments follow a recommendation in a special report of the Remuneration Tribunal. Currently, holders of these offices are granted recreation leave but do not accrue an entitlement to a specific quantum. This has the consequence that an office holder who ceases to hold an office is not entitled to be compensated for accrued leave not taken on the basis applicable to Government employees generally. Long standing practice is to make ex gratia payments on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will facilitate payments to office holders in respect of recreation leave accrued but unused on cessation of office. It may therefore result in some minor cost to the Commonwealth. This cannot be readily calculated, because it is wholly dependent on leave actually taken by office holders. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are cast so that the new provisions will operate only where consequential amendments are made to the Acts establishing the relevant offices. The Schedule to the Bill makes appropriate consequential amendments to a large number of those Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to the Remuneration Tribunal Act is also proposed to enable the remuneration of the Vice Chief of the Defence Force to be determined by the Tribunal, complementing the provisions of section 9B of the Defence Act 1903. </PARA>
<PARA> Further amendments will clarify the jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to certain offices in higher education institutions. The Tribunal was given this jurisdiction when the Academic Salaries Tribunal was abolished on the commencement of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. As a consequence of the transfer of part of the jurisdiction of the Academic Salaries Tribunal to the Tribunal, some ambiguities have arisen in the relevant provisions of the Remuneration Tribunal Act. Clarifying amendments are proposed to ensure that the original intention behind the legislation is reflected in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill will give legislative effect to the package of measures associated with the petroleum resource rent tax announced by the Government in the 1990-91 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will extend, from 1 July 1990, the resource rent tax to Bass Strait, replacing the complex and arbitrary excise and royalty regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure will not only permit the generation of a fair return to the community from the production of hydrocarbons, but will do so in a manner which encourages the producers to efficiently drain the Bass Strait province in a manner which has greater regard to the producers' capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also introduces a generous concession to exploration activities, permitting the deduction of exploration expenditure incurred from 1 July 1990 in respect of all offshore operations subject to the RRT, against RRT liability on a wider basis than at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Exploration expenditure incurred by a person will now be deductible for the purposes of the resource rent tax against the RRT liability of any of the projects held by that person, rather than only those projects undertaken in the relevant permit area as at present. This is a significant reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The package of measures will provide a more certain and efficient basis for the taxation of petroleum production and encourage exploration activity in offshore Australia, our most prospective area. </PARA>
<PARA> The resource rent tax is based on achieved profits rather than production levels and is, therefore, sensitive to changes in prices and costs. </PARA>
<PARA> This responsiveness will remove the pressure for continual changes to the taxation regime in the Bass Strait as production declines or market conditions vary. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the resource rent tax to Bass Strait will, as I indicated earlier, promote the optimal recovery of Bass Strait petroleum reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> New fields will become viable and recovery from existing fields will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> This is expected to lead to the recovery of a further 200-300 million barrels of oil from Bass Strait and, over the longer term, it can be expected that gas production will also be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of wider deductibility for exploration expenditure will improve the efficiency of the resource rent tax and stimulate the exploration effort in offshore Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously, deductibility was limited to individual permit areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements make the after-tax cost of exploration within RRT paying permits the same as the cost outside those permits. </PARA>
<PARA> The current disincentive to explore in frontier areas will, therefore, be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> An important change for the discovery of new hydrocarbon accumulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the significant benefits to industry of wider deductibility of exploration expenditure, the existing carry forward arrangements for undeducted expenditures under the RRT will be modified. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangement will reflect the relative likelihood of recovery exploration and development expenditures, in contrast to the existing composite carry forward rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The carry forward rate for general expenditures incurred from 1 July 1990 will be reduced from the long term bond rate plus 15 percentage points to the long term bond rate plus 5 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> Undeducted exploration expenditure will continue to be eligible for compounding at the long term bond rate plus 15 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, when the Treasurer introduced this Bill in the House of Representatives he announced a minor change in the treatment of resource rent tax payments under the income tax law. Under the existing provisions, RRT is deductible for income tax purposes only after the final assessment has been made (typically in the income tax year following that in which the instalments are made). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that instalments of RRT should be deductible for income tax purposes in the income tax year in which they are paid. </PARA>
<PARA> This change, which will apply to payments of instalments made on or after 1 July 1991, is consistent with general principle that an income tax deduction should arise when a payment is made. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation giving effect to this change is expected to be introduced into the Parliament as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government has been aware of concerns that the transition from excise and royalty in Bass Strait to the more efficient resource rent tax could cause changes to Victorian gas prices, with possibly disruptive consequences for industry and domestic consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also announced when introducing this Bill in the House of Representatives that the Government has, therefore, decided to provide the Victorian Government with a special grant of $30 million for each of the first two years of application of resource rent tax, to minimise any transitional pressures on gas prices. </PARA>
<PARA> This payment is in addition to the commitment made in last year's Budget to ensure that Victoria will receive revenues in 1990-91 and 1991-92 equivalent to the royalty revenue it would have received under the excise/royalty regime.</PARA>
<PARA> In this way, Victoria will not be exposed to any significant short term adjustment pressures as a result of the extension of the resource rent tax to Bass Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Victorian economy, and Australia generally, will benefit from the long term improvements in efficiency and additional investment and production that resource rent tax will generate in Bass Strait.</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to outline some specific features of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Bass Strait</PARA>
<PARA> Resource rent tax will apply to petroleum recovered from 1 July 1990 in the area of the Bass Strait permit known as VIC/P1. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the tax all production licences related to the Bass Strait permit will be treated as one project and all expenditures incurred before 1 July 1990 will be taken to have been deducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the resource rent tax is the effective secondary tax regime applying to Bass Strait from 1 July 1990, producers have continued to be liable for excise and royalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of excise and royalty paid by the producers up to 30 June 1991 will be used as a credit against their final resource rent tax assessment for the 1990-91 year. </PARA>
<PARA> Any excess payments will be refunded to the producers. </PARA>
<PARA>Wider Deductibility</PARA>
<PARA> Where a person has excess deductible exploration expenditure from one project that is incurred on or after 1 July 1990, that excess will be transferable to other projects held by that person that otherwise have a tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA> For company groups expenditure will be transferable on a group-wide basis. </PARA>
<PARA> To prevent potentially significant revenue losses under wider deductibility, compounding of undeducted expenditure at the long term bond rate plus 15 percentage points will be limited to expenditure incurred within 5 years before the year in which the production licence was granted in relation to the project against which the expenditure is being deducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Exploration expenditure incurred more than 5 years before the relevant year will be eligible for compounding at the GDP deflator. </PARA>
<PARA> This is consistent with the existing project basis carry forward arrangements which limit compounding of the long term bond rate plus 15 percentage points to expenditure incurred within 5 years before a project's production licence came into force. </PARA>
<PARA> The transfer provisions for wider deductibility of exploration expenditure will contain certain anti-avoidance measures. </PARA>
<PARA> These will require a person to have an interest in both the project in which the expenditure was incurred and the project to which the expenditure is being transferred at the time the expenditure was incurred, at the time of transfer and any intervening period. </PARA>
<PARA> This will prevent a person from, say, acquiring a project with an income stream only to absorb undeducted exploration expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> In all circumstances transfer must be made to the project with the most recent production licence and the oldest eligible expenditures must be taken up first. </PARA>
<PARA> To minimise the risk that project-specific expenditure for unsuccessful or marginal projects would not be deducted, the amendments will provide for an order of deductions that will ensure project-specific expenditures are written off first. </PARA>
<PARA> The order of deductions for RRT liable projects will be non-transferable project expenditure, including general expenditure and pre-1 July 1990 exploration expenditure, project-specific exploration expenditure, closing down expenditure and other project transferable exploration expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> These important changes to the resource rent tax have an estimated cost to revenue of $305 million in 1990-91 and $450 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> A revenue positive outcome is expected in 1992-93 and in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes come at a substantial cost to fiscal policy in the first two years of the operation of the new measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this is a price worth paying for the greater efficiency and certainty which these taxation arrangements provide. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, therefore, that the elements of the resource rent taxation regime be held constant in future years when the new RRT arrangement starts to recoup revenues for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Put more bluntly, the producers will have secured a windfall benefit in these early years of the new arrangement and will not be entitled to a change of arrangements when the RRT starts to bite in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter on the adjournment this evening in relation to parliamentary delegations to Australia from other countries. Past practice has been that these delegations are conducted on a bipartisan basis. In fact, when such delegations take place, quite frequently the parliamentary friendship group that associates itself with that particular country hosts a lunch or a dinner. That is also conducted on a bipartisan basis. What happened yesterday, I hope, was just a minor and occasional blip in what is the accepted practice. I certainly hope it is not an indication of how the Government intends to use these delegations for the remainder of its term. I wish to detail my concerns to the Senate in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday a parliamentary delegation from Italy visited Parliament House. In the morning it had a number of discussions. I think it had discussions with the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson; then with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, Mr Con Sciacca; then with the shadow Minister for social security, Senator Alston; and then with Senator Patterson who, as a shadow parliamentary secretary, has a particular interest in social security matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Social security matters were of particular interest to the Italian delegation. The Australian-Italian parliamentary friendship group hosted a lunch. At that lunch, I was surprised to find myself at a table with a staffer from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security. I was not surprised to be at a table with a staffer, although one wonders whether government staffers are meant to be included in these friendship group luncheons. But that is not a matter I wish to raise. I am not sure at whose largess the particular staffer was there, but that is not a matter which concerns me. What concerns me is that the staffer from Mr Con Sciacca's office leaned across the table and asked a Public Service interpreter from one of the departments-not from the Department of Social Security, I understand-`Well, what did Senator Alston discuss with the delegation this morning?'. That is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> If parliamentary delegations cannot come to this place and speak with all parties in confidence-whether or not we all know that the issues raised are social security matters-it is a serious problem. It is a serious problem if the staffers of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are going to sidle up-either at a parliamentary friendship group lunch or in the corridor; I do not care where it happens-to Public Service interpreters and ask, `Well, what did Senator Alston discuss with this delegation?'. That kind of activity puts every delegation that comes to this Parliament on notice that, if it is not talking to the Government, it is not talking in confidence. It is a disastrous situation; it is a deplorable situation. I would be pleased to hear what the Minister, who may be responding tonight, has to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA> What was more deplorable was the reply from the interpreter, who was also sitting at the table at which I was seated. There were two interpreters arranged for the delegation, but I am talking about only one of them. I was told that this particular interpreter was not required for all of the meetings. I assume, as I was not at any of them, that was because a good deal of the membership of the Italian delegation was able to speak English. But the interpreter was in the vicinity. In response to the question `What did the delegation discuss with Senator Alston this morning?', the interpreter said words to the effect of, `Well, I was only able to eavesdrop momentarily or for a few minutes'. He then related the subject of one of those discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are two instances which represent a serious breach of the bipartisan approach which should be taken to these delegations. I do not give two hoots if the interpreter decided for himself that the particular subject that he related was common knowledge. There may have been lots of others or it may have been the only subject-as I was not there, I do not know-but as I gather, by his remark, that he was able to `eavesdrop' only for a limited period of time, there may have been only one discussion. But it is not up to interpreters to make an assessment of whether a matter is one of common knowledge or not. It is certainly not up to a staffer from Mr Sciacca's office to seek information from an interpreter about what the Opposition has discussed with a foreign delegation. It is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this happened at a lunch raises the question: if these friendship groups are to survive, be effective and continue to be conducted on a bipartisan basis, as they have been in the past on all occasions to my knowledge, what is the purpose of having a Parliamentary Secretary's staffer there? I have no objection to an interpreter being present because some members of the delegation who may not speak English may like to have a discussion privately with one of the senators or members. </PARA>

In such a case the services of the interpreter or translator would be required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the question of staffers from offices is a very serious one. I see no reason why, if Government staffers are there, everyone else should not take their staffers along to these functions. We would all have a very nice party. It is a serious matter, Mr President, and it is one in which you have an interest. I hope that you and the Speaker will raise this matter with Government Ministers, get to the bottom of it and make sure that this sort of thing never happens again. The bipartisan approach to the friendship groups and parliamentary delegations is at risk, and it is a disgrace to this Parliament that we are in that situation. </PARA>

Firstly, the delegation is not an official delegation from the Italian Parliament; it is a committee that is visiting this country. I believe that the Italian Parliament has paid for its members to visit, so this does not fall into the usual category of bilateral delegation visits. I do know that at times the Speaker and I have had serious difficulties in trying to get enough people to attend lunches and official dinners to show courtesy to the visiting delegations, and members from Ministers' staff, my staff, the Speaker's staff and from shadow Ministers' staff have been invited. I do not know of the circumstances to which Senator Vanstone has referred tonight, but I will make inquiries about them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to raise certain matters relating to the administration of the State of New South Wales-matters which fall within the jurisdiction of the Government of New South Wales and which are relevant to the general election of 25 May. Tonight I wish to discuss the draining of the public purse by the Office of the Premier of New South Wales and to expose the use of polling by the State Government for absolutely blatant political purposes which serve only the interests of the Liberal Party of Australia. A public servant, Mr John Stirton, works in the office of the New South Wales Premier. Previously, he was the prime mover in the now notorious organisation known as Community Polling, an arm of New South Wales Inc., the illicit agency of the New South Wales Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 30 June 1988, the New South Wales Premier issued a confidential memorandum to all his Ministers. A copy of that memo has been given to me. It is to all Ministers from the Premier and is dated 30 June 1988 regarding market research and opinion polls. The text reads:</PARA>
<PARA>In order to have all information on hand relating to Government Market Research and Opinion Polls, I have asked John Stirton of my office to be responsible for co-ordinating this project. </PARA>
<PARA>Please advise your departments and statutory authorities that Mr Stirton should be informed of all proposed research so that a central register can be kept in my office. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim of this change is to streamline market research, combine some projects to lower expenditure and improve the current tendering procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Where a Minister is interested in the responses to one or two poll type questions, this can be arranged with John Stirton on a weekly basis.</PARA>
<PARA>It is signed `Nick Greiner, MP.' The memorandum's real significance is revealed when the New South Wales Opposition asked for assurances that:</PARA>
<PARA>Publicly funded market research is not being used for party political purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The Premier of New South Wales refused to give that assurance. Its significance is further revealed in a letter dated 13 March 1991 from Mr Ken Hooper, Chief of Staff for the Premier of New South Wales, to Mr Bruce Hawker, a policy adviser to the leader of the New South Wales Opposition, Mr Bob Carr. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Hawker,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your Freedom of Information request of 30 January seeking access to documentation relating to market research and opinion polling, conducted by or co-ordinated through the Premier's office since April 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Your request has been carefully considered but it has been decided that access should be refused on the grounds that the material will be exempt under Clause 8 of Schedule 1 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Ken Hooper,</PARA>
<PARA>Chief of Staff</PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at clause 8 of schedule 1, one sees that it bears absolutely no relationship to government research. Why on earth could not this material be made freely available? Under further questioning in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Mr Greiner admitted to having circulated the memorandum, which I have quoted, and confirmed that the polling was not done by the Liberal Party. If it was not done by the Liberal Party and in the absence of other information from the Premier, the clear inference which may be drawn immediately is that this work was being paid for by the Government for and on behalf of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the memorandum was circulated the public was still unaware of the existence of the organisation known as Community Polling. But as we now know in this chamber and beyond, Community Polling had three specific functions: first, to conduct covert fundraising operations for the Liberal Party prior to the 1988 New South Wales elections; secondly, to conduct opinion polling for the Liberals; and, thirdly, to conduct covert funding of dummy Independents whose preferences would flow to the Liberals in the March 1988 election. At that poll, the New South Wales Liberal Party produced a how-to-vote pamphlet that extended preferences in all of the 109 seats. I will return to that point later. </PARA>
<PARA> The owners of Community Polling included the former Minister for Education, Dr Terry Metherell, and the abovementioned John Stirton, also at that time an adviser to Mr Greiner. So Mr Greiner's pollster in opposition is now his pollster in government, as indicated by the memorandum. The research is paid for by public money, public dollars, public taxes. It is public waste. The $900m public waste of the Greiner-Murray Government extends to its research program. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Opposition has since attempted to use the totally inadequate New South Wales Freedom of Information Act to establish precisely what market and research and opinion polling Mr Stirton was conducting at taxpayers' expense. I have read the response; it is a complete stone wall. </PARA>
<PARA> In March this year the Premier's office refused the request, as detailed in Mr Hooper's correspondence, stating that Mr Stirton's opinion polling was exempted because it was research material. It was research material for what purpose and for whom? What on earth is the secrecy? What is there to conceal? Why can it not be disclosed? In other words, what the Premier of New South Wales said was: `Yes, it is true that polling is ongoing, but the public cannot have the material. The public and the Parliament are not entitled to the material.' He said that he was simply doing opinion polling on behalf of his Ministers, but for what purpose? This case is not disputed; it is confirmed in the Parliament. It is a matter of public record and it is not in doubt. The opinion polling was ongoing. </PARA>
<PARA> We also know that Mr Stirton, a public servant, is currently staying with the Premier in five-star comfort and travelling with him in Lear jet circumstances. But the Greiner-Murray Government's misuse of public moneys does not stop there. The company engaged by the Premier to do the Liberal Party's advertising for these elections is none other than Clemengers, a company headed by someone very close to Mr Greiner, Greg Daniels. Mr Daniels previously worked for Campaign Palace, the New South Wales Liberal Party's 1988 campaign advertising agency. The coincidences do not stop there. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, Campaign Palace donated $18,000 to Mr Stirton's business, Community Polling. This reflects the incestuous nature of Liberal Party Government/Community Polling deals. The tie is very clear. It is unmistakable. Subsequently, Mr Daniels and his new company, Clemengers, picked up some very handy advertising contracts from the Greiner-Murray Government. In fact, Clemengers obtained contracts for Elcom and a $13m State Lotteries account, which includes Lotto, draw lotteries and instant lotteries, to name but two. Elcom, of course, is the most compliant Government business enterprise in New South Wales. Honourable senators will have witnessed some of the recent board appointments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question which demands to be answered is: what tendering went on before these contracts were awarded? What was the process? Why did the tenders go in that particular direction? There is no doubt that Liberal Party polling in the hands of this agency can be used, and indeed has been used, to finetune and target these politically motivated advertisements. Elcom is now totally politicised. Again, that is not in doubt. That is not disputed. The job awarded to the Elcom account was to make political advertisements disguised, or concealed, as legitimate public advertising on behalf of the Greiner-Murray Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Could it be that Mr Stirton's opinion polling and market research was tied up with this scam? Is that an unfair question? Was it the basis for the advertisements? Perhaps Mr Greiner will care to deny it. The one simple fact of New South Wales politics now is that we need believe nothing until Nick Greiner denies it. We then know that it is true. The New South Wales Government, to date, will not say anything. It has refused to give any information to the Opposition or to the New South Wales public. In the absence of any further statements from Mr Greiner or Mr Stirton, it is fair to assume the worst. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may be interested to know that the other company which picked up the bulk of the advertising account of the Greiner-Murray Government was George Patterson, a company well and favourably known to the Federal Liberal Party. It is, of course, the Federal Liberal advertising agency. This company, together with its subsidiaries, now has a $21m advertising contract with the New South Wales Government. As I mentioned, George Patterson, by coincidence, just happens to be the Federal Liberal Party advertising agency. This is incestuous indeed. The master media agency for the New South Wales Greiner-Murray Government is listed as Jamieson House Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of George Patterson-another coincidence. Between January and the first week of April this year, 94 per cent--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Aulich is right. It is disgraceful. We have the State Liberal account, the Federal Liberal account and the Greiner-Murray account becoming totally blurred, with public money being poured into their coffers. That 94 per cent figure represents at least $2.5m in actual billings, some $300,000 minimum to the master media agency. In a full year, this would represent a minimum figure of $1m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thing that offends me and a lot of other people most is not the obvious tie between the Federal Liberals and the State Liberals. The tories are entitled to have their advertising agencies. I do not believe that they are entitled to tie them up with the New South Wales Government, which is what they have done. But, in the case of one of the agencies, we are not even talking of an Australian agency. It is a subsidiary of a foreign company. Which foreign company? Saatchi and Saatchi. This is Thatcher's agency, the agency that did so much to strengthen the social fabric of the United Kingdom under Thatcher. We have special favours being awarded and a government tied to special interests. We will see what Mr Greiner says tomorrow. As I say again, we need believe nothing about New South Wales politics until Nick Greiner denies something. </PARA>
<PARA> The rorting of the public purse with these overtly political advertisements became so extreme that the New South Wales Auditor-General-not the Labor Opposition; not the media-was forced to write to the head of the Premier's Department, Mr Dick Humphry. I have a copy of Mr Humphry's letter of 21 February to the New South Wales Auditor-General, Mr Robson. It states in part:</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 24th January, 1991 drawing my attention to the need for the Government to have regard to advertising which may be considered as promoting the incumbent Government during periods leading up to the State elections . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that Mr Humphry took a full month to reply to the Auditor-General. During that time, the Greiner-Murray Government's paid political advertising, disguised as Government advertising, continued unabated. Indeed, it continued right up to the calling of the general election. In fact, just a week ago the New South Wales Minister for Police used the internal police network, which is used for operational police matters, to promote Liberal Party propaganda. Perhaps this is not surprising, given Ted Pickering's record. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are clear. Mr Stirton was a key figure in Liberal Party opinion polling, before the election of the Greiner-Murray Government, in the organisation known as Community Polling. He continued in that role when he became a public servant-and at taxpayers' expense. He continues his role in Liberal Party politics tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an unnaturally close relationship between the polling activities of Community Polling and the blatantly political government advertising campaigns conducted by Clemengers and George Patterson. Note the financial ties that we can see all the way through this web of interlocking relationships between Clemengers, Pattersons and Community Polling. Now Clemengers have the New South Wales Liberal Party advertising account. This whole thing would be intolerable in private enterprise. It ought not to be tolerated in the State of New South Wales. </PARA>

He has popped in to give us a little chat on his concern about what has been going on in New South Wales. While he has been away in Kathmandu, he has missed all the lovely juicy-what a shame; Senator Loosley is not going to stay. I am sure that other people will be quite interested in listening. Let us see what Senator Loosely has had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One cannot help but feel that it was but a pathetic attempt to allay what must have been to him the devastating effect of the Burkegate expose which has been going on while he has been in Kathmandu. Not only that, but he has been away while we have seen the unemployment figures come in showing that only New South Wales has employment rates that are growing; while we have seen Victoria slip more into the mire financially; while we have seen the State Bank of South Australia lead the plummet of South Australia into oblivion; and while we have seen the murky mire in Western Australia become murkier and murkier. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Loosley has missed the contortions of Senator Evans and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) trying to work out ways that they can give money to Mr Burke. Indeed, as I pointed out earlier today, they finally fixed up a way to give him that lump sum and in a way in which he can attract a lesser tax rate on it. Altogether, he has missed a whole lot of things that have been going on. Not only that, but he missed the wondrous bringing down of the report of the Resource Assessment Commission, and because he was not here he missed all the questions that were asked during the Estimates hearings concerning that Commission. In particular, he missed the questions that Senator O'Chee asked concerning the community attitudes survey conducted by the Resource Assessment Commission. Surprise, surprise, if one looks at this questionnaire, which had a bar code on it-and people who did not respond were sent a follow-up letter-one sees on page 4 in question A.6 nice, important statements, including the following:</PARA>

<PARA>Closer to the National (Country) Party-3</PARA>
<PARA>Closer to the Australian Democrats-4</PARA>
<PARA>If the answer is `Other', we gets a five. Then the survey asks in question A.8:</PARA>
<PARA>Would you call yourself a very strong, fairly strong or not very strong supporter of that party?</PARA>
<PARA>Then we get a rating of one, two or three. The extraordinary thing about that very vital information-which is clearly the business of the Resource Assessment Commission, and absolutely necessary for any work it will do!-is that the Commission then published a report entitled Forest and Timber Inquiry Consultancy Series. But guess what? There is not one syllable in it about political parties-about how closely one was to the political party, how one felt about the political party or, indeed, whether one thought that income and wealth should be redistributed to ordinary working people. So one asks: where did it go?</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, I go one step further and recall an inquiry before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts where we dealt with the question of the number of awarded accounts given to Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd (ANOP). That is Mr Rod Cameron's company-we remember him, do we not? He used to be the first best friend of Mr Loosley, as he then was. But Mr Cameron and Mr Loosley had a falling out because they had a different view about the way in which ANOP served the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> But not to worry: when we had a Public Accounts Committee hearing we had question upon question being asked and witnesses come and testify about the number of awards that were made to ANOP to do research for various Government departments, and-surprise, surprise!-we did not get so much as a sniff of a report. We did not even get a print-out and neither did the Department. Furthermore, we did not even see the questions that were asked. At least with the Resource Assessment Commission we have seen the questions, we have seen the report and we have seen the lack of information being published. </PARA>
<PARA> But in the other area we did not see the questions and we did not see the print-outs. Neither did the departments, because we asked them the question. Furthermore, we did not even see answers published anywhere. So I said during Senator Loosley's speech that we were getting very near the old analogy of pots calling kettles black. I said that he was looking remarkably kettle-like.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Give me time, Minister. It was nice of Senator Loosley to drop by and attempt to drop a bucket, because I have distinct recollections of the John Singleton agency being awarded the Buy Australia campaign. If my memory serves me correctly, there was a little committee called the Publications Committee which vets, for and on behalf of this Government, all advertising contracts which are awarded. I think the main person who sits on that Committee is one Senator Graham Richardson. I happen to recall that we had a long debate in this chamber about the fact that the tender process went out and a recommendation was made by a committee established to evaluate the submissions made. The recommendation did not happen to include Mr Singleton. So, guess what? This time it was Senator Richardson who intervened in the tender process. He instructed the Committee to kindly reconsider the people who had applied. The person who was then admitted was none other than Mr John Singleton, who was ultimately awarded the contract, which was worth, I think, $2m at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now we have this whole sort of episode being perpetuated with Senator Bolkus intervening in other sorts of tenders. As we have seen, Senator Richardson was able to do it, so I suppose that Senator Bolkus thought the precedent had been set. So I hear the hollow words coming from Senator Loosley, who had his own brush with things that were difficult in New South Wales: I hear the pious words fall from the lips of an apparatchik of the Labor Party who is part and parcel of the push to have advertising banned so that we will no longer be able to have the words of political parties and independent people heard in the political process. And guess what? We are going to have the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, headed up by Mr Peter Westerway, determine what can go to air. So the question of what departments have to say is going to become much more relevant. Someone has just dropped on my desk a nice little press release, too; it is an important one. I think we would all be enlightened by the additional information here. It is put out by my good friend and colleague Senator Kemp, who said--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel rather sorry for Senator Loosley. He was sent in here to try to save a sinking ship and he was told to talk about opinion polling. Little did Senator Loosley know that we on this side of the chamber already had a substantial amount of information about opinion polling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Bishop said, that information was the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) community attitude survey on forests and the timber inquiry. Senator Loosley is disappearing again; I suppose he is going to see whether his press release got a run. When I put questions to the departmental officers in Estimates Committee A, they did not even know about the survey in question. They had to take all the questions on notice. I would like to read from the answer those officers provided to Estimates Committee A on my question on notice. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Political beliefs, (Questions A.7 and A.8) are a significant component of social and cultural values and are important in setting an historical context to the development of attitudes to the environment in Australia. Inclusion of the questions on political beliefs also permitted comparisons with surveys on environmental issues conducted previously in Australia and overseas which use similar or identical phraseology. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us just take that portion of the answer and pull it apart bit by bit, because I am going to enjoy this, as I am sure everybody on this side of the chamber will as well.</PARA>
<PARA> It says that political beliefs are a significant component of social and cultural values. Well, if they are a significant component of social and cultural values, why are details not given in the report? It is very simple. They are just too significant a component of social and cultural values to be put in the report because they will be kept by the Resource Assessment Commission. The RAC reports to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. I will get back to that later. However, if political beliefs are so significant, one would have expected to find details in the report, yet they do not appear. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Inclusion of the questions on political beliefs also permitted comparisons with surveys . . . overseas . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Why was the comparison to be made? It was not for the purposes of the Resource Assessment Commission or for the purposes of the public, whose dollars funded this shoddy little exercise. The comparison was to be permitted for the purposes of the Labor Party, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. That is why those questions were put in there and why the information was withheld. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, in the adjournment debate tonight, Senator Loosley had the audacity, or perhaps the naivety, to try this shoddy little political stunt. Little did he know, of course, that we on this side of the Senate had the arguments and the answers to throw back at him. Senator Loosley so infringes the customs and traditions of this place that he did not have the courtesy and good manners to remain in the chamber to hear the reply to his speech. That is the sort of attitude that Senator Loosley has towards this chamber and towards the Parliament in general. I believe that Senator Loosley ought to abide by the traditions and customs of the Senate and stay in the chamber to hear what is said in reply. But he does not do that, and it is because he is not interested. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the questions themselves, and I would invite any honourable senator in the chamber to show me the link between the following five statements and forests:</PARA>
<PARA> Income . . . should be redistributed towards ordinary working people. </PARA>
<PARA> More money should be spent on reducing poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the unemployed just don't want to work.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot find any link with forests in relation to those statements. Further:</PARA>
<PARA> The trade unions in this country have too much power. </PARA>
<PARA>I might agree with that, but I cannot find any link with forests. Now comes the fifth chance for the Minister and the other senator present on that side of the chamber to find a link with forests:</PARA>
<PARA> Trade unions are necessary to protect the workers. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I cannot find any link with forests there. I could run through all the parts of A.6 in the survey, but I shall not do so. The references I have made are sufficient to show that this questionnaire was nothing but a sham on the part of the Government and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet-and remember, it answers to Mr Hawke, the temporary leader of the ALP. Only his department and the Resource Assessment Commission have the answers to this survey. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as Senator Knowles says, it was all paid for by the taxpayers. Senator Bishop has already referred to question A.7. It asked whether people felt themselves closer to the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the National Party, the Australian Democrats, or others. Question A.8 asked how strongly they felt that affiliation. I suspect that the results of the survey must have been alarmingly disappointing for Prime Minister Hawke. Given the enormous plunge in the popularity polls currently being experienced by the Labor Party and honourable senators opposite, I think the Prime Minister would have felt that the response to question A.7 was alarmingly disappointing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we can go through and find other questions in this survey. I will take just a random sample. Question D.8.c asked people for whom they worked. It asked whether they were self-employed, private company, business employee and so on. Question D.9 is very interesting also because it ties in with Questions A.6, A.7 and A.8. Question D.9 asked whether people belonged to a trade union or a staff association. They can answer yes or no to those questions. As I said, there is a very good link between questions A.6, A.7, A.8 and D.9, but I cannot find the link between any of them and the forests. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this displays what a sham this survey was. What I find particularly disturbing is that the copies that were distributed to respondents, unlike the copy which I have with me tonight, had a bar code on the back. The answer to my question on notice was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Each questionnaire was bar coded to allow follow up of non-respondents. </PARA>
<PARA>I am going to be very fair to the Government here, and give it a free kick. The answer continued as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>This is normal practice in mail surveys to ensure the highest possible response. Cross-referencing of the bar coding to addressees was destroyed by DATACOL after each questionnaire was received. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us take that on face value. Let us assume, for the time being, that that was destroyed. That does not stop my constituent's fear that personal political beliefs would be kept and made available to the Government, the Australian Labor Party and any of their friends. That is a very real fear. I do not care what is said in answer to one of my questions. For me, the fear and perception of my constituent are the most important things. I think that this was a disgraceful effort. My constituent received not one, but a number, of follow up letters which she thought were of a threatening nature. Of course, this is how the Resource Assessment Commission and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Prime Minister Hawke and his friends on the other side of the chamber get their information. It is funded by the taxpayer and uses methods that many respondents find intimidatory and offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Loosley came in here and delivered his speech it was not for the real purpose of making a speech, but, I am sure, merely for the purpose of ensuringthat it appeared in Hansard so that he could cover himself with regard to the press release which he undoubtedly put out some time beforehand. We see that Senator Loosley and the so-called gentlemen senators who sit opposite have very little reason to come into this chamber and pontificate. I am sure that Senator Collins will get up and try to run some of the more useless arguments that he has been running about political parties on this side of the chamber. He has been running them for a while and they have not been terribly successful. No doubt, he will try it again tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the comment I make is that every time a Government senator tries that sort of argument, it sounds less and less convincing. As the enormity of the losses in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia mount up, it sounds less and less convincing. As the enormity of the financial impropriety in Western Australia mounts up, it sounds less and less convincing. When Senator Loosley came into the chamber tonight to try his shoddy election stunt in this Federal Parliament, it sounded even less convincing than anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> All I would say is that I really do feel sorry for Senator Loosley. He has just come back from Kathmandu, no doubt having learned a lot from his trip. I saw a report in the paper which said that he had found out a lot about election rigging and about the stealing of ballot boxes. No doubt that is something he might want to bear in mind at a future date. But I say that Senator Loosley should not come into this chamber and try this sort of stunt. It displays a contempt for the Senate, a contempt for the chamber and a contempt for the procedures of this place. His whole attitude and his speech this evening have been indicative of that. I think Senator Loosley has done himself no credit. </PARA>

<PARA> I was aware that the delegation that came out here from Italy was not actually a formal, official Italian delegation; not that that makes any difference at all to the concerns Senator Vanstone raised. The only point I want to make is that, if the conversation that Senator Vanstone reported took place, it was most unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been overseas only twice in 15 years in politics, which must be some sort of a record. They were both CPA trips; one trip was to Africa and the other to the Isle of Man. I enjoyed those trips immensely because of the great courtesy-and any honourable senator who has ever been on a CPA delegation will know what I am talking about-that was shown to us as visitors by parliamentarians in those countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I am responding to specifically-and although the President has covered it, I want to say it myself-is Senator Vanstone's concerns about staffers attending these functions. I speak in defence of the staffers, because as Vice-President of the Northern Territory branch of the CPA, I have requested staffers to attend functions twice this year on my behalf. At times we have great difficulty in relation to delegations, particularly in the dry season, the winter. Many delegations which visit the Northern Territory want to visit Kakadu National Park and to be shown around Darwin and so on. With a total membership of only 25, the CPA in Darwin often finds it difficult to extend to those people the proper courtesies that most parliamentarians want to extend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A multitude of delegations come to Canberra; a week does not pass without that happening. It is occasionally embarrassing that at the functions that are put on-we need to make some sort of a show-we often cannot get members of parliament to attend because of their busy schedules. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;l absolutely agree with that. I am sure that this matter will be investigated by the President who, I know, is particularly concerned about matters like this. If the comment that was referred to was made, it was entirely inappropriate and unfortunate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply want to say that I am grateful to the members of my staff who, as a matter of courtesy, twice this year have on my behalf attended functions held for delegations from overseas, when I could not attend. They have extended the courtesies that need to be extended by members of parliament to those delegations. I am personally grateful to those members of staff who do that. But I make the obvious point-and I hope it is taken-that members of staff who assist in providing those courtesies should be sensible enough to realise that they should behave courteously at these functions which they are attending on behalf of the members of parliament. I have no doubt that the President will make inquiries about the particular function that Senator Vanstone referred to in order to ensure that if the incident did happen, it does not happen again. </PARA>
