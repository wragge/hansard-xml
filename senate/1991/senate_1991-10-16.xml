<TITLE>AIDEX Exhibition</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>  A humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>  Attention is drawn to Australia's increasing role in the militarisation of the Pacific region and in particular to the current Government-led arms export drive.</PARA>
<PARA>  The arms trade is not only detrimental to Australians affected by the diversion of public money away from socially beneficial areas--for example, health, education and social welfare--but is an integral factor in the oppression and poverty of the people of the Third World.</PARA>
<PARA>  Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will:</PARA>
<PARA>    Cease all military aid and training to governments engaged in repression of their own people.</PARA>
<PARA>    Direct all Federal and State Government Departments and instrumentalities to withdraw from participation in and support for AIDEX and similar arms fairs in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>    Close down AIDEX 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>    Establish a register of all applications for arms transfers and offset agreements which would be subject to public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA>    Redirect all monies currently being used to promote the arms industry to socially useful research, development and production.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pensions: CPI Relativity</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>  The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that pensioners are being burdened with an increase in the cost of living and are receiving no compensation for it. Because the CPI is not specific to the spending patterns of pensioners, a decrease in the cost of living has been shown as 0.1% which therefore cuts out a rise for this September. CPI has shown a negative movement because within its basket of goods, are luxury items that have dramatically decreased in price and therefore cover the increase in basic consumer items that are relevant to the spending patterns of pensioners. Also the wage/tax deals that have occurred between the Federal Government and unions has meant that Australian workers have received an increase in their take home wage but we have seen no counterbalance occur for pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA>  Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to negotiate with the Federal Government to introduce a pension CPI measurement that takes into consideration the spending patterns of pensioners. Also that a $4.50 rise be granted to pensioners to compensate them for the wage/tax deals that occurred in January `91.</PARA>

<PARA>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill implements the recommendation of the First Report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act that, as a matter of priority, the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to fix a maximum age of 70 years for judges of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Family Law Act was enacted in 1975 there was no maximum age for judges appointed to the Family Court. Judges had life tenure in accordance with section 72 of the Constitution, as it then stood. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1976 report on Retiring Ages for Commonwealth Judges of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommended that a compulsory retiring age should be introduced for all federal judges. The Committee recommended that the appropriate maximum age for justices of the High Court should be 70, and that, after an appropriate amendment to the Constitution, Parliament should legislate to prescribe a maximum age of 65 for judges of other federal courts. The proposal to amend the Constitution to provide a compulsory retiring age for all federal judges was accepted in the 1977 referendum. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the referendum in 1977, section 72 of the Constitution was amended to provide a maximum age for federal judges of 70 and to provide that Parliament may make a law fixing a maximum age for judges, of a court created by Parliament, at less than 70 years. The only law made, pursuant to section 72, fixing a maximum age for judges at less than 70 years is in relation to the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 23A of the Family Law Act 1975, which fixes the maximum age for judges of the Family Court at 65, was inserted in the Act in 1977 following the constitutional amendment. At that time the provision of a maximum retiring age of 65 was a reflection of community concerns that Family Court judges should be aware of and keep abreast of current social values and attitudes and took into account the demanding and arduous nature of some, if not all, family law disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Joint Select Committee believes that the reasons for fixing a retiring age of 65 for the Family Court are no longer valid. The Committee concurred with the views of the Family Law Council that it is important for Family Court judges to be aware of current social values and that there would not be a substantial difference, in this area, between judges who were 65 and those who were 70. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment will not require judges to remain on the Court past the age of 65. Judges will still be able to retire at an earlier age, and if over age 60 will be entitled to receive the maximum judicial pension if they have served 10 years or more as a judge. </PARA>
<PARA>For some time criticism has been made of the nature of the Family Court and its operations. For example, in 1985 Chief Justice Gibbs made some criticisms of the specialist nature of the Family Court in his address to the 23rd Australian Legal Convention on the State of the Australian Judicature. </PARA>
<PARA>His Honour noted the limited scope of the jurisdiction of the Court and questioned whether the work of the Court required strengthening. He also suggested that the limited scope of the jurisdiction of the Family Court was unlikely to attract lawyers who might be expected to be appointed to Supreme Courts or the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the experience of the Family Court over the past 15 years has demonstrated the wisdom which led to its establishment. The past 15 years have not been easy. Nevertheless the Court has maintained the highest standards in the administration of justice. Since its inception in 1976 the Court has attracted judges and other officers of a high standing in the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA>In recent years the Government has taken some initiatives to ensure that the Court continues to have the capacity to attract high calibre lawyers. For example, following the recommendations of the 1987 report of the Advisory Committee to the Constitutional Commission on the Australian Judiciary the Government legislated to increase the jurisdiction of the Court. </PARA>
<PARA>The Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Act 1988 provided a mechanism whereby the Family Court could exercise jurisdiction under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Trade Practices Act 1974. Further, Commonwealth and State cross-vesting legislation allows the Court to exercise the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and various State Supreme Courts in appropriate matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Following this increase in jurisdiction the Government legislated to bring the salaries of Family Court judges into line with Federal Court judges. The amendment to the Family Law Act to increase the maximum retiring age of judges from 65 to 70 years will ensure that the terms and conditions of judges of the Family and Federal Courts are equivalent. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Family Law Act by repealing section 23A which fixed the maximum retiring age at 65. The provisions of section 72 of the Constitution, providing a maximum age of 70 for federal judges, will apply to all future appointments to the Family Court. When the legislation is passed the existing judges whose commissions are limited until age 65 will be given new commissions in terms of the new age limit. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also amends section 41 of the Family Law Act to provide that judges appointed to State Family Courts are permitted to hold office until age 70. This is to ensure that judges of the Family Court of Western Australia, the only State Family Court established under section 41, may also hold office until age 70. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY</PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENT BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill contains several proposals which are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness  of the  operations  of the  National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The major reform contained in the Bill will prevent the disclosure of the existence of process issued by the NCA in the course of its investigations. It will also prevent disclosure of any information about the reference, the investigation or any hearings or proceedings to which the process relates. Previously some recipients of NCA summonses or notices, such as financial institutions, felt obliged to inform their clients of the receipt of these documents. This has resulted in suspects being alerted to NCA investigations and concealing or destroying evidence or going into hiding. The amendment will help to prevent this happening again, and will clarify the legal position of these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to this, the amendment will also serve to protect the reputation of suspects at a time when the allegations have not been properly investigated. The recipient of the summons or notice has to be given sufficient details about the suspects so that they can determine what information is required. The potential for damage to the reputation of these people through disclosure of the existence of the summons or notice could be significant. </PARA>
<PARA>It is for these reasons that the decision to make a notation restricting disclosure can only be made where the NCA is satisfied that failure to prohibit disclosure might prejudice the safety, reputation or fair trial of a person, the effectiveness of an investigation, or it is otherwise in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision has been designed in a way which is consistent with the NCA's desire to be more open and accountable. Instead of a blanket prohibition, this provision will only apply where, subject to the criteria I have just mentioned, a decision is made to restrict disclosure in a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that the provision contains a number of other safeguards:</PARA>
<PARA>  Under the amendment, disclosure will always be permitted to allow the person served with the NCA process to obtain legal advice or legal aid in relation to the process or matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further, where process is served on a legal practitioner, disclosure can be made to allow the practitioner to comply with any legal duties of disclosure arising from the professional relationship with the client, or to obtain instructions in relation to legal professional privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>  Depending on the particular case, disclosure may also be permitted in other circumstances specified in the notation on the summons or notice. </PARA>
<PARA>  A further safeguard is that the prohibition will only remain in force for a maximum period of five years or until the investigation is concluded, whichever occurs first. If the investigation is concluded and the NCA has been advised by the prosecuting authority that no prosecution will be undertaken, or there is no evidence of an offence, or in other cases criminal proceedings arising from the investigation have been commenced, then the prohibition will no longer apply. Where this occurs the NCA will be obliged to notify those to whom the summons or notice was addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>The NCA is giving a higher priority to the co-ordination of efforts by State and Commonwealth law enforcement agencies against white collar and corporate crime. It is evident from past experience that these complex investigations also lead to the disclosure of major tax evasion, proceeds of crime and money laundering offences. White collar crime transcends State boundaries and effective control can only be achieved by the co-ordinated national activities of agencies such as the NCA. The power to obtain documents had proven to be a powerful tool in NCA investigations of fraud and related criminal activity, which are often document based. This amendment will improve the effectiveness of investigations in these important areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also contains three more minor amendments which will help to improve the functioning of the NCA. The first will enable the NCA to apply for a warrant of apprehension where a witness fails or refuses to appear at a hearing. Currently, such witnesses may be fined or imprisoned under the Act, however, the current penalties do not in themselves ensure attendance at a hearing. Access to a warrant for the arrest of such people would assist the effective conduct of NCA hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>The second of these will allow the Chairman of the NCA, rather than the Attorney-General, to appoint counsel to assist the Authority. This amendment is in line with recent Government moves to devolve such powers to authority heads to improve efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the amendment will authorise the NCA to inform relevant members of the Inter-Governmental Committee about general investigations being conducted in their particular State or Territory. At present there is a cumbersome procedure whereby the information has to first pass to the Commonwealth Minister before dissemination to the State or Territory Minister. It is the view of the Government, the NCA and all the States and Territories represented on the Inter-Governmental Committee that the States and Territories current access to information regarding references and special investigations be extended to include general investigations and to improve accountability. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe this Bill contains important reforms which will improve the effectiveness of the NCA as a national law enforcement body. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>HEARING SERVICES BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before the Senate provides for the establishment of the Hearing Services Authority from 1 July 1992. This Bill gives effect to Cabinet's Decision of October last year that the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) Hearing Services Program become a statutory authority, to be known as Australian Hearing Services. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will repeal the Acoustic Laboratories Act 1948 and amend section 9A of the National Health Act 1953, to bring the delivery of hearing services under one piece of legislation. Some may ask what changes will eligible clients experience? I can assure you that eligible clients will experience enhanced quality, cost effective, timely and relevant hearing services, both rehabilitation and hearing impairment prevention. </PARA>
<PARA>The new legislation will require the Authority to consult with relevant Government, business, commercial, industry, and consumer bodies in delivering services to eligible clients. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be no change to eligibility under the new Act--the Authority will continue to provide hearing rehabilitation services to Department of Social Security pensioners with a Pensioner Health Benefits Card and their dependants, Veterans' Affairs pensioners, anyone under the age of 21 years, people referred by Australian Defence Forces, Comcare, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and the Australian Government Health Service. These services will include hearing loss assessment, the selection and fitting of appropriate hearing aids and devices and counselling at no charge to the client. It is only in respect to the repair and maintenance of hearing aids and devices and for the annual supply of batteries that clients, other than those in receipt of the Family Allowance Supplement and children of eligible clients, will continue to be required to make a small contribution. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will cover veterans for this cost. </PARA>
<PARA>The reorganisation of NAL as a statutory authority represents just one part of the reforms for the delivery of services to public interest clients who have a hearing impairment and who would but for this service not be able to afford the hearing aids and devices supplied by the private sector. It was for this, among other reasons, that the Government decided last year, not to follow the Industry Commission's recommendation that the whole hearing services market be opened up to two way competition. </PARA>
<PARA>Senators will be pleased to hear that considerable progress has been made with the joint venture between NAL and its commercial partner, Australian Hearing Aids (AHA). AHA is a joint venture between the Commonwealth (NAL) and AHA (which is a joint venture between Crystalaid Pty Ltd., a wholly owned Australian company and Ascom, a Swiss communications consortium) for the design, development and supply of the third generation of programmable hearing aids to NAL's clients and for exports markets in Asia, the United States and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>This arrangement was possible because of the high international regard for the National Acoustic Laboratories and the Government's Hearing Services Program. It means that NAL will be able to supply world leading programmable hearing products to eligible clients from 1 January 1993. The establishment of NAL as a statutory authority underpins this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the objectives of the Authority will be to participate, as far as is practicable, in promoting and establishing export markets for the jointly designed and developed hearing products. From this NAL stands to earn royalties from both the hearing aids and remote control units sold overseas. The government has been guaranteed minimum royalties of $2.6 million on all exports with projected royalties of over $9 million over the period of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA>As with many Government services some may consider this scheme excessive in the current economic climate, however, when one considers that nearly one in every ten Australians has a hearing impairment and that this ratio increases to one in every three people over the age of 65 years, then this more than justifies the need for a readily accessible and affordable program to assist those people. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's NAL Hearing Services Program employs a team of highly trained and caring people, including university trained audiologists, some of whom specialise in either paediatric or adult services, technicians and administrative staff to ensure that eligible clients receive the level of service they require to enable them to communicate effectively in their everyday life. These services are delivered through a network of over 100 permanent and visiting NAL Hearing centres to ensure that all clients receive the same level of service across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>NAL provides a comprehensive hearing health care program which is aimed at improving the quality of life for many pensioners who could otherwise be cut off from everyday life. The services provided by NAL also target children to ensure that their early development and learning is not impeded by their hearing impairment. NAL currently sees some 200,000 hearing impaired people. Last financial year NAL assessed some 50,000 new pensioners, veterans and children and fitted a total of 80,069 hearing aids. NAL's technicians repair about 270,000 hearing aids and devices each year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill does not alter the delivery of services to NAL's traditional hearing impaired clients, it simply makes changes to the administrative and operational aspects of the Program. The provision of hearing rehabilitation services to the traditional clients of NAL, including the fitting of appropriate hearing aids and devices, their maintenance and repair as well as batteries will continue to be provided by the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Another of the Authority's major activities will be research into hearing loss, hearing assessment and rehabilitation, hearing loss prevention and the effects of noise on people. A further activity for the Authority, which fits with its more commercial orientation, will be the hearing impairment prevention services provided by NAL. These activities fit well with the Government's overall objective of promoting better health in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>The new organisational arrangements for the delivery of hearing services to eligible clients set out in this Bill will see the appointment of a Board of Management which will report direct to the Minister. Members of this Board will be by Ministerial appointment and will consist of representatives from business and consumer organisations as well as the General Manager of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The Board of Management of the Authority will, in accordance with the legislation, develop and operate under a Corporate Plan that sets the financial and operational targets for the Authority. As with all Government bodies and programs the Authority will have to perform against set targets and performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA>The day to day operations of the Authority will be managed by a General Manager and the organisation will be restructured to facilitate these arrangements. The General Manager will also be appointed by the Minister. Staff of the Authority will continue to be appointed and employed under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority will continue to operate under a Group 2 Trust Account, which was established on 1 July 1991. All monies and payment of all expenditures and disbursements relating to the Authority's operations will pass through this account. The Authority will also be subject to the same reporting requirements in relation to estimates and receipts of expenditure for each financial year, as any government body. Similarly, the Authority will be subject to the Audit Act and its reporting mechanisms as with any statutory body. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the new arrangements the Authority will continue to be primarily budget funded with monies being appropriated to the Authority by the Parliament. Although the Authority will be exempted from taxation, including payroll and sales tax, it will be required to pay customs duty, as it currently does. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision is made in the Bill for the levying of charges for products, services and facilities. Such charges will be set by regulation as is currently the case for any fees or charges levied by NAL. The Authority can enter into contractual arrangements up to $1 million without the approval of the Minister, but must have ministerial approval for any contract above this amount or for the sale or acquisition of property. </PARA>
<PARA>The rights of clients are protected by the inclusion in the Bill of both independent internal review, by the General Manager and external review of decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affecting the rights of clients, including the imposition of charges. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's endeavours to streamline the operations of NAL has already borne fruit, with the introduction of computer systems and dramatic reductions in waiting times in all Hearing Centres. As a statutory authority, NAL will have the flexibility to achieve further improvements in the cost and timeliness of its services, and as a bonus will have low cost state-of-the-art hearing aids for Australians together with technology transfer and export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  Debate (on motion by Senator Reid) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Last night Senator Knowles raised a few questions in relation to the conduct of former Ambassador Burke under this heading. I wish to raise a couple of matters on the same subject. As Senator Knowles is not here at the moment, I will do that now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the Committee will recall, there has been an issue relating to the sale of a number of cars by Mr Burke which, on the face of it, would have been contrary to the guidelines for ambassadors. The Estimates Committee was advised during the hearing that it had been determined that then Ambassador Burke was not in breach of the guidelines because the Government was satisfied that he was not aware of them. Arising out of that, in relation to the four cars that Ambassador Burke sold, I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans)--although details of the mileages on cars that were not sold under diplomatic privilege have been provided--what the mileages of the two cars sold under diplomatic privilege were. </PARA>
<PARA>  I raise that matter because part of the guidelines provide that it is a requirement that cars purchased and resold under diplomatic privilege are not so purchased and resold for the purpose of making a profit. This is something that the DFAT officials would have been aware of when they sought further information from former Ambassador Burke in relation to this prima facie breach of the guidelines by him. It would be helpful to me and to the Committee, I am sure, if the Minister would now tell us what the mileages on the two cars sold subject to diplomatic privilege were. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Hill has already been advised in a written answer to the question, which appears on page 39 of the Estimates Committee B: Additional Information Received Volume 1 as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The vehicles were sold privately by Mr Burke without access to diplomatic privilege. Attached is a copy of a Third Person Note from the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs confirming that the requisite duties and taxes on these two vehicles would be paid prior to their sale. Under these circumstances there is no record of the mileage readings at the time of disposal nor is there any requirement that such records should be available. </PARA>
<PARA>The short answer is that there is no such information available. There was no breach of any Irish rules relating to entitlement to purchase vehicles, nor did any breach occur of the Australian Government guidelines in this particular matter. The disposal of the vehicles using diplomatic privilege would have been, had it occurred in this way, outside departmental guidelines, but Mr Burke became aware of those guidelines and their application to him before a sale on this basis took place. Therefore, unlike what Senator Hill said at the outset of his question, there was no actual breach of the guidelines. It was not simply a matter of that breach being somehow mitigated or balanced by an absence of intent. The breach did not, in fact, occur. I think that answers all aspects of the question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I understand the position, it is different from that which the Minister has just related. In fact, there were four cars involved in this difficulty, two of which were traded in or sold in order to purchase the further two cars which were referred to in the answer which the Minister mentioned which appears on page 39 of volume 1 of the additional information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My question relates to the first two cars, which I understand were under diplomatic privilege and were sold under diplomatic privilege. I ask:  what was the mileage on those cars?  If they were not being sold for the purpose of profit, why were they sold such a short time after the then Ambassador took possession of the cars and took up his post?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am somewhat astonished because what we were told at the Estimates Committee hearing was that there was a full investigation to see whether in fact Mr Burke had breached the guidelines. One of the guidelines is that diplomats are not to purchase and resell cars under diplomatic privilege for the purpose of making a profit. In any proper investigation, it would clearly have been a subject that the investigating officer would have considered. I would have thought that the investigating officer would have sought details of the sale of the trade-in vehicles, the mileage and whether those vehicles were sold at a profit. Is the Minister now telling the Committee that these matters were not considered in the investigation of the possible breach of the regulations? If that is not the case, and in fact they were considered, will the Minister please obtain the details and bring them to the attention of the Committee in due course?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-All I can say is that, as appears on page B39 of the Estimates Committee Hansard, two years after the purchase of the original vehicles they were then traded in and new vehicles purchased. A two-year time gap would not seem to raise any questions at all of the kind which seem to be on Senator Hill's mind. As I understand it, at the termination of Mr Burke's posting, those two vehicles were proposed to be sold by Mr Burke. It was made clear to him that they could not be sold under benefit of diplomatic privilege at that stage; to do so would have breached the guidelines. On that basis they were sold privately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There were two vehicles purchased originally and traded in after two years in favour of two more vehicles. There was the further complication of one vehicle being a replacement as a consequence of accident, about which there seems to be no dispute. There was a further vehicle that was purchased as a result of express permission from the Department in the context of Mr Burke's large family of car driving age people, all of which was fully explained. It is not a matter of trying to avoid any further scrutiny of this particular matter. We believe the relevant matters have been clearly made out. They do not give rise to any colour of concern of the kind that Senator Hill was suggesting. </PARA>

In this instance, as I said a moment ago, the Government has excused former Ambassador Burke from his apparent breach of regulations on the basis that he was not aware of the regulations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is an issue that was taken up with me by representatives of the Jewish community in Australia before the Estimates Committee hearings. As I recall, it was the subject of some passing attention in the Estimates Committee discussions. Be that as it may, I have followed up the issue by requesting the Department to find out what it can in relation to our own practice and the provisions--such as they are--that are on the books at the moment in order to govern our reaction to this and, in particular, to do a comparative exercise in relation to what other countries equally concerned about the boycott are doing by way of ensuring that no aid or comfort is linked to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think there was almost an implication in what the Minister said that there may well be ways in which the Australian Government has given some comfort directly or indirectly to the Arab boycott. I accept what the Minister has said--that he has now called for a report and that he will examine the report. I ask him not only to examine the report, but also, in due course, to advise the Senate of his determinations in that regard. If, in fact, the Australian Government is directly or indirectly supporting the boycott, would he come clean and advise the Senate accordingly? If it is not and if, as a result of this report, he has altered practices of the Government, would he advise senators of the altered practices in order that this particular concerned section of the Australian community might have its concerns rendered null and void?</PARA></TALK.START>

I have said nothing to indicate either way a basis for the sort of concerns that Senator Hill has expressed. I think it is quite premature to make any assumptions of the kind that he has that there is anything to `come clean' about or to indicate that the Australian Government has been less than rigorous in opposing the boycott.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is again a matter that has been consistently raised with me by members of the Australian Jewish community who are concerned about the plight of the Syrian Jewish community and the way in which it is subject to significant human rights restrictions, particularly limitations on whole families emigrating. We as a government certainly share those concerns. We have made direct representations to the Syrian authorities through our Embassy in Damascus on the circumstances and conditions of members of the Syrian Jewish community and on other related issues of human rights concern. Those issues were also raised by us at ministerial level in 1984 and 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We believe that these representations to the Syrian Government, in conjunction with representations that have of course been made by other governments, have brought results in improving the situation of both Jews, and non-Jews for that matter, in Syria. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in answer to a question on notice in August 1989, the Government has not raised the situation of Jews in Syria in international forums. It is the Government's view that such a course of action is not warranted at the present time and that representations direct to the Syrian authorities are more likely to be effective in assisting Jews suffering from discrimination and other forms of human rights abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is a position that has been carefully arrived at on the basis of a judgment as to what is likely to be most productive. That is a judgment that we will, of course, keep under close review with the stimulation of further representations, no doubt, from Mr Kaplan and other members of the Jewish community in Australia who are very closely monitoring this issue. We will do our best to ensure that the pressure is maintained and that positive results flow for those people who have been very hard-pressed for a very long period by a less than sensitive administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My understanding was that, quite apart from all the very specific documents from AIDAB to which Senator Harradine sought access, and with which I provided him yesterday, he also sought access to the departmental brief that had been prepared for the China human rights delegation and which those people took with them to China. There was obviously quite a deal of confidential material in that brief. It was that to which I was referring last night. Senator Harradine is welcome to have access to that brief if he seeks, through his office, to make arrangements for that to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the Minister. That brief presumably is the one that emerged from the human rights section of the Department. When we discussed this matter in the Estimates Committee in 1990, the Department made it clear to the Committee that there was a human rights section of the Department which was responsible for collating information about human rights violations, assessing it and making recommendations both internally and through the secretary to the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Can the Minister indicate whether I am correct in assuming that that is the section which really has responsibility for assessing human rights violations in all of the areas which are of concern to the Minister, to myself and to the whole of this Parliament, including all of those areas that the Minister mentioned were appropriate and desirable for the human rights committee to investigate during its visit to China?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is the case that the human rights section within the Department has the primary responsibility for collating this information and working out operational priorities. It certainly had the primary responsibility for compiling the brief that accompanied the delegation to China. However, all of the work that the human rights section does in this respect is done in very close consultation and cooperation with the relevant geographical desks in the Department which often have more specific expertise and knowledge available to them about the situations in particular countries. So it was, in the context of this particular exercise, that there was that close liaison between the human rights section and the China desk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There was also close liaison with AIDAB because a number of the issues that the human rights delegation had to address--including ones with which Senator Harradine has been particularly concerned, such as population policy and so on--were very much within the primary competence of AIDAB. Again, there was consultation and liaison with AIDAB accordingly in preparing that material. There is no short answer to these sorts of questions about organisational responsibility; that responsibility is shared where the expertise lies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I now turn to the area of responsibility in regard to the admitted gross violations of human rights in China because of its one child per family policy. I want to assess, and I feel that it should be for the Committee to assess, why the human rights section of the Department did not undertake an examination of the violations of human rights in that area. Why did it allow AIDAB--which has a vested interest in this particular area--to take the running on the advice in this area? Indeed, why did AIDAB contract out this task to Dr Terry Hull of the ANU?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Information was supplied to me last night that $12,000 was paid to Dr Hull in May 1991 for a paper entitled Human Rights and Family Planning--Aid Issues and Priorities; $9,000 was paid to Dr Hull in June 1991 for a paper entitled Recent Population Policy in China; $3,180 was paid to Dr Hull in May 1991 for appraisal, comments and specialist advice requested by AIDAB; and $1,800 was paid to Dr Hull in June 1991 for the preparation of a report entitled An Investigation of Reports of Coercion in the Indonesia Vasectomy Program. I ask this quite deliberately, bearing in mind that when we are dealing with human rights questions we have to get the issues right. We cannot accept an individual who has a publicly expressed predisposition of support for population control programs which inherently involve violations of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not suggesting that Dr Hull supports violations of human rights; I am quite deliberate in what I have said. He is on record as supporting population control programs which inherently involve violations of human rights. An amount of $27,000, or something like that, was paid to Dr Hull, an employee of the university. Dr Hull made recommendations that one way to alleviate the problem of violations of human rights was to pay money to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities--UNFPA. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are talking about China. The UNFPA Executive Director, Nafis Sadik, recently made a comment about the China population control programs. On 8 April 1991 she told the Chinese Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade that China should feel very proud of its achievements in effectively controlling the growth of its population and of the remarkable results in implementing UNFPA's cooperation programs. It is clear that there are gross violations of human rights in this particular area in China. Whoever gave the advice to the Australian human rights delegation to China in respect of these matters has obviously led the delegation to present a report to this chamber which in this regard is fatally flawed. On page 47 of the report of the delegation to China it states:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Delegation raised allegations that compulsory abortion and compulsory sterilisation were used to enforce the one-child policy. It was assured by Chinese officials that these practices were strictly proscribed and contrary to policy, although the officials conceded that such abuses of rights did occur in the early days of the family planning program. . .</PARA>
<PARA>One of the appendices attached to the delegation's report is the family planning regulations for Sichuan province--the only province, it appears, where the delegation met family planning officials. The appendix is incomplete; the full text of the regulations should have been included. The full text includes article 13, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Couples who have serious hereditary diseases including psychosis, mental deficiency, and malformation must not be allowed to bear children. Those who are already pregnant must terminate the pregnancy. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 14 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Either husband or wife should adopt sterilisation measures after they have two children. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 23 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Those who refuse education and give birth to children not covered by the plan will be fined from the month the child is born. . . Regarding pregnancy not covered by the plan, both husband and wife will be imposed a fine of 20 to 30 yuan a month during the period of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy is terminated, the fine imposed will be returned. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 27, which I will just mention as an aside, deals with illegal removal of intrauterine devices. So much for the acceptance by the delegation to China of the statements by Chinese officials that those practices, that is, compulsory abortion and compulsory sterilisation, were strictly proscribed. In fact, they are prescribed by the very regulations only part of which the delegation included in its report to this Parliament. If that is the way the Department is to treat human rights in this area, I believe it should take a good look at this matter. In my view, it should not spend taxpayers' money to provide an opportunity to Dr Hull, who for a long time has been a vigorous protagonist of the UNFPA and of population control programs, to assess the issue of human rights in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade--and I respect his stand on human rights--that we are talking about a very important issue. I would probably be ruled out of order if I were to debate the issue, but here we are talking about the money that has been paid to an outside consultant who is a supporter of population control programs and who makes recommendations to governments as to the way in which to inject voluntarism and care into population control programs. It is being given to the very people who are putting pressure on governments of developing countries to adopt these programs in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am indebted to Senator Harradine for expressing confidence in my Department and the Human Rights Branch in that at the outset of his remarks he indicated that he would prefer it if all these matters were dealt with by that group. I share his assessment that it is an outstanding group of professional officers. The difficulty is that there are only four of them in the Human Rights Branch of the Department. The officers have a huge brief in terms of multilateral issues, forums and bilateral representations. It is physically impossible for them to do directly and personally the kind of detailed research that this and related issues demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The story is very similar in regard to AIDAB. There are resources within AIDAB which have been devoted to monitor information about the operation of these related programs. But, as elsewhere in the Department and in the Public Service as a whole, those resources are extremely stretched at the moment. Senator Harradine has asked AIDAB repeatedly to follow up on press reports and other issues that he raises, and there are not the kind of in-house resources available to undertake this research in the necessary detail. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this area as in others from time to time AIDAB has engaged and necessarily will continue to have to engage consultants to undertake this work. They will be selected using standard government procedures. That is what happened in regard to the selection of Dr Terence Hull. For the record, I should mention Dr Hull's qualifications. He is Senior Research Fellow in Political and Social Change at the Australian National University. He is a very widely respected demographer whose recent work includes, as we know, examination of population issues in China and Indonesia. He has been involved in a number of projects in international organisations, not only the UNFPA, to which Senator Harradine adverted, but also the international development program at Australian universities and colleges. He has recently been commissioned by the Australian Academy of Science to do a piece on social and ethical implications of population growth. I am told that he has written articles which have been quite critical of a number of countries' population programs, including most recently the Indonesian program. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are talking about someone who perhaps, as Senator Harradine has said, although I do not know, is a proponent of the UNFPA and of population programs generally, and he is not alone in that respect. I proudly wear that particular badge myself, as Senator Harradine knows, as I have told him on various occasions. I have made no secret about my support for that organisation and for the kind of programs generally that it has been responsible for pursuing and promoting. Indeed, I say with the utmost respect to Senator Harradine that I think the great majority of parliamentarians would have a similarly supportive attitude towards properly conducted--and I emphasise properly conducted--population programs. They share the kinds of concerns that I and many others have about explosive population growth as a contributor to poverty and underdevelopment. This is a long policy argument which no doubt we will continue to have in instalments every year in this place. But I do not think Dr Hull's views, if they are as Senator Harradine has described them, would make him in any way unusual in either the larger public community or the specific demographic professional community in the way that has been described. </PARA>
<PARA>  The particular tasks that Dr Hull undertook by way of consultancy for AIDAB, in return for which he received the sum of $27,000, as has been indicated, included the following: a study of charges of coercion in the Indonesian vasectomy program, which was published as a separate AESS development paper that was made available to Senator Harradine; and a study of family planning and human rights in China, which was provided as a background paper to the recent parliamentary delegation on human rights. That report is also to be published as an AESS development paper, but has not been published yet. Dr Hull also did for this sum an overview of family planning and human rights, again to be published as an AESS development paper, and produced some briefing notes on contraceptive methods. AIDAB found Dr Hull's services in terms of quality of work and value for money expended to be thoroughly satisfactory. There is little I can add in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA>  As for the China human rights delegation report, it is a report of a parliamentary committee and must speak for itself. Obviously the committee had a very wide ranging brief of matters to cover in the 10 working days that it spent in China. The family planning issue was discussed, as paragraph 39 of that report makes clear, not only in Sichuan but also in Beijing and Lhasa, as well as in the capital of Sichuan, Chengdu. The only on-the-ground visit involved a family planning clinic in rural Sichuan. It was one of a number of human rights issues that were being pursued and the degree of detail that could be devoted to this in terms of the delegation's activities and its report was necessarily limited. Senator Harradine will acknowledge that the report is not uncritical of what it saw and heard, even on that limited basis.</PARA>
<PARA>  Certainly the Government has not been uncritical of aspects of the population program in China. Our basic position--and we have communicated this to the Chinese Government on a number of occasions--is that, while we do recognise the immense problems that are facing China in terms of population growth, we are concerned about reports of human rights abuses in the implementation of its family planning policies. Those concerns were reiterated by the delegation and articulated by Dr Blewett, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, when he wrote to the UNFPA in February to put on record his firm view that Australia does not support the use of coercive practices in China's family planning program. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Senator Harradine well knows, I have made this clear in earlier statements to Estimates Committee B and to this chamber. Dr Blewett has taken an identical position in his reaction to this. We have made our position very clear to the UNFPA. We do not believe that the UNFPA is at all supportive of such coercive policies. The difficulty is that, in a complex program being run in a country as large and complex as China, aspects of that country's policies will no doubt continue to cause concern from time to time. But, in our judgment, that does not justify a withdrawal of this kind of support and activity. It demands constantly being alert to the issues, constantly raising them and constantly putting pressure on the Chinese authorities to cease and desist whenever any information of such practices emerges. We are doing that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister has not explained the inherent inconsistency of the China report, which appears to rely, and presumably relies, on advice given by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or by Dr Hull to the Committee and paid for, according to the information we have, with something like $12,000 in May 1991. Dr Hull may be engaged in other activities in respect of that paper, which is called Human Rights and Family Planning--Aid Issues and Priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This is a very serious matter. When the dictators in China are overthrown by the people, the people's anger will go against those who have imposed policies onto their very personal lives under the threat of violations of human rights. Not only those dictators but the international population control organisations and their institutional strengthening academics in various countries will be blamed by the people who have suffered. So it is a very important point. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister has not explained why the China report accepted the assurances of Chinese officials that the practices of compulsory abortion and compulsory sterilisation were not in force in the one child per family policy. He has not explained why the appendix on the Sichuan family planning regulations is only partially there. Why does the report not include the full regulations or at least those to which I referred dealing with people having certain diseases, including psychosis, mental deficiency and malformation; in other words, the eugenic provisions of those regulations?</PARA>
<PARA>  The regulations also state that those who are already pregnant must terminate their pregnancies. So certain practices are in fact prescribed in the regulations. What I want to know and what I want to have publicly is all the information provided to the delegation--this should not be a matter of secrecy--in respect of violations of human rights in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want the Minister to consider whether, in an area as important as human rights, it is really appropriate to leave these matters to somebody contracted by AIDAB and not by the human rights section of the Department. The Minister has not indicated where UNFPA has come out strongly critical of the population control program in China. I have quoted a statement by the Executive Director of UNFPA only last April, where she praised the population control program in China. The person who is contracted by AIDAB to make recommendations and assess the situation of human rights comes from a department which receives income from UNFPA. Is it reasonable for AIDAB to pay all this money to Dr Hull? I have had a brief look at some of the things he says in this document entitled An Investigation of Reports of Coercion in the Indonesian Vasectomy Program. This is a political document printed by AIDAB. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that the Minister supports UNFPA. He is a politician, as I am. I do not expect that we should pay taxpayers' money to somebody in the ANU to do a political job on human rights. Human rights are too important for that. Nothing that I have seen of Dr Hull's writing goes to the essential character of human rights or their indivisibility or universality in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I want to mention two things to the Senate. First, I believe that this matter and all these amounts paid out to Dr Hull are not about human rights. They are about the Congress of the United States of America. We all know that there is a campaign running through UNFPA, IPPF and other international population control programs to get money from the United States Congress and the EC. I heard it when I was in Europe just a couple of weeks ago. There is an enormous push to get academics and others to make sure that there is more money paid by taxpayers throughout the world to population control organisations such as UNFPA and IPPF. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have said before in debates in this chamber, poverty is political and if we put our eggs in this basket, as it were, we are going down the track of violations of human rights and we will not rectify the problems of poverty. Secondly, and incidentally, I should indicate that whilst Dr Hull has received all this money his wife, Dr Valerie Hull, who is head of the relevant section of AIDAB, also received a contract from AIDAB to do a population kit for members of parliament which infringed human rights questions. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not really care what happens in the political area; that is up for grabs. Politics is up for grabs. But we are dealing with important questions of human rights and I believe it is important for the Department and for the Government to ensure that when they get advice on and assessments are made on human rights they obtain information from people who are objective and able to assist them from a principled background. I wonder whether Dr Hull's contracts were supported by the human rights section of the Department. </PARA>

<PARA>  Equally, in all fairness, Senator Harradine should be willing at least to give prima facie credence to the integrity, sincerity and credibility of others who perhaps take a different policy view than his own, including in this instance Dr Hull, and he should not make judgments about professional integrity or appropriateness or capacity to do these sorts of jobs based simply on what he perceives to be a difference of basic perspective. </PARA>

The work he has done is professionally sound, as I am advised and as it seems to me on, admittedly, a very brief and cursory reading. I find it difficult, other than on the most extreme definition of what counts as political, to accept Senator Harradine's characterisation of the report by Dr Hull on the Indonesia vasectomy program as being a political report. Equally, I have difficulty in accepting otherwise than at its face value the piece of work on recent population policy in China that Dr Hull did on commission from AIDAB as a prelude to the human rights delegation's visit, which report was made available to Senator Harradine last night.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes. With minor editing changes only, I am told, this was the work that was done on commission from AIDAB, specifically in the context of the impending visit of the human rights delegation. It will be published as soon as the process works itself out. So there is no gap between any of this material in terms of what was privately made available to the delegation and what will be, in due course, in the public domain. The time delays will be the normal delays that occur in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As to the content of this particular report, it must speak for itself, as the parliamentary delegation's own report must speak for itself. It is a report to me, but not one that I influenced in any way as to its content. I have to simply take it as it appears. One of the themes that does emerge from Dr Hull's paper is that, while it is supportive of the work of bodies like UNFPA, it is supportive from the perspective, in the context of these human rights issues, that the work of foreign donors in China, far from legitimising abuses that may in fact occur there, helps counter those abuses, helps counter coercive practices, and promotes the principle of voluntary participation in family planning. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator Harradine</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Where is the evidence for that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is a judgment that is made and the judgment is made on the basis that external presence of this kind provides first-hand observation of how programs work, provides opportunities for policy dialogue and provides opportunities for the kind of pressure to be imposed that is the only thing likely to produce results. Moreover, apart from that kind of dialogue and policy level communication, by providing technical advice and better contraception, there would appear to be little rational doubt that foreign assistance will also help reduce the number of abortions. After all, the UNFPA does provide three million improved, I am told, IUDs a year, which is estimated to result in 300,000 fewer unwanted pregnancies each year than might otherwise occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The other argument which underlies all this and which I think also appears in Dr Hull's paper--whether you agree with it or not, it is at least a credible prima facie argument--is the argument that defunding a Chinese family planning program would only result in more authoritarian practices, as cadres sought to achieve the same targets that are given but with fewer resources to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are matters we cannot debate in full on this occasion, any more than this environment has allowed us to debate these matters in full on any previous occasion. I simply ask Senator Harradine to accept a little more readily the good faith of those whose basic views about the appropriateness of population policies are different from his own, just as I can assure him that I and others in my Department, those in AIDAB and those who are involved in this process do accept his own good faith, his own integrity, and his own genuineness of commitment to the values and principles that he espouses. </PARA>
<PARA>  By all means let us debate the policy. By all means let us debate the factual material, the objective material, that is made available. Let us debate whether conclusions follow from premises. Let us debate the causality, the effectiveness, of these different arguments. But do not, please, let us work from the premise that somehow there is an inherent bias and unprofessionalism, a lack of integrity or a lack of principle on the part of any of the people who are doing their best to wrestle with these very difficult issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  On one final specific matter, Senator Harradine mentioned the position of Dr Hull and Dr Hull's wife, Dr Valerie Hull. I am advised that she has recently returned to AIDAB after a two-year leave of absence and that AIDAB is ensuring, with her active cooperation, that she is not in a position of authority over any population consultancy contracts which might involve Dr Terence Hull. That is an obvious precaution that has been taken of the kind that one would expect a professional outfit such as AIDAB to take. I hope that will lay to rest at least one of the fears that might exist about the Hull family's involvement in population policy matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I object to the Minister indicating to the Committee that I may not respect Dr Hull's integrity. It is not the point at all. So far as his view of the world is concerned, I respect his entitlement to have it. All I am doing is raising questions about taxpayers' money spent by the Government and paid to Dr Hull in the very important area of human rights violations. He has been involved in a campaign of support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Minister says that he supports UNFPA. He is a politician. I suppose Dr Hull is entitled to support UNFPA. His Department gets money from UNFPA. He asked the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for more money for UNFPA and other population control organisations. He has done this over a number of years. Dr Hull's track record is there. If the Department wanted an objective analysis of human rights violations in China, why did it get a man with that track record of support for population control programs  which by their very nature are coercive, though he personally opposes those coercive aspects?  Nobody has denied that Nafis Sadik, the Executive-Director of UNFPA, praised the China population control program. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I said that this document is political, I said it deliberately. This document was produced by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, written by Dr Hull--AIDAB paid Dr Hull for it--as a response to what a member of the House of Representatives said in a speech. It is political all right. Honourable senators should listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA>Critics of coercion in family planning, like Mr Bradford--</PARA>
<PARA>the member of parliament in the other place--</PARA>
<PARA>have called for the withdrawal of funds for national programs and from the international agencies which support national programs. The above discussion shows that this suggestion is simplistic and that there is no evidence that foreign funds or advice are the cause of coercion, except indirectly through the promotion of management techniques involving targets which provoke authoritarian bureaucratic systems to put pressure on clients to invoke compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>The program in Indonesia complained of by Mr Bradford was, in fact, the result of pressures put on the Indonesians by the United Nations Population Fund, by the World Bank and by the World Health Organisation. As authority for that I quote Dr Hull et al in an article entitled `Indonesia's Family Planning Story: Success and Challenge' which appeared in the Population Bulletin Volume 32, No. 6 of November 1977. In that article Dr Hull stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The turning point in government policy--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Indonesian policy--</PARA>
<PARA>came with an invited mission of foreign experts in the fall of 1969, sponsored by the United Nations, the World Bank and the World Health Organisation. The mission judged family planning achievement to that time as disappointing, primarily because of inadequate organisation and administration. Later embodied in a first Five-Year Family Planning Program . . . their recommendations included . . . a doubling of the five-year target for new acceptors from three to six million. Organisationally, the mission advocated government involvement on a massive scale, from a Central Family Planning Institute with a chairman nominated by the President, down through provincial, regency and subdistrict institutes chaired by governors, regents and subdistrict heads. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have an admission that it is the pressure from these international organisations that is the problem. We certainly have a political document here, published by AIDAB, the bottom line of which recommends further funds for these international agencies which were the cause of the problem in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>  If that is not a political document, I do not know what is. All I say is that if the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is to adopt a principled approach and have these vital issues assessed and discerned professionally and objectively it ought to go to somebody who does not have a vested interest--I talk about vested interest in a polite sense--in these particular types of programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Chairman, we are talking about taxpayers' money. As the Minister said, we can have debates on these issues at other times. However, I have looked at Recent Population Policy in China and it is also fatally flawed. In its appendices--I have just had a five-minute look at the paper--it proposed to include critiques of the book by John S. Aird, but only negative ones. Some highly respected Chinese scholars have praised Aird's book. The way that the paper happens to deal with my contributions is--I will not say `contemptible'--political. On these important matters of human rights I ask that the Department get someone who will be able to professionally discern the issues relating to human rights and go to the questions, the philosophical discussions, about human rights, not somebody who is following the party line.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I know by now that I will never get the last word in any of these discussions with Senator Harradine;  so I do not want to prolong this debate unmercifully, except to say that I really do think the quality of these publications and these research documents should be looked at entirely on their own terms and not by reference to some perception as to the basic position of the person writing the articles. The reason that the person mentioned, Dr Hull, was chosen to undertake this various work through a transparent, competitive, contract process was his expertise in matters of demography and the technical issues that are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If there are biases revealed in the way in which he has dealt with the material or has drawn conclusions, let those biases be the subject of debate or criticism on their own terms in a proper way. I do find a little troubling, as Senator Harradine will appreciate, the suggestion that, because someone is generally supportive of population policies and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, in particular, that person is thereby somehow incapable of being objective about the limitations or serious problems that may be associated with particular programs. It is not my understanding that Dr Hull is insensitive in that way. We may be destined to differ about that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can only ask that these matters be looked at as calmly and objectively as possible in exactly the same way as I and, I hope, my Department looks at any evidence that Senator Harradine brings forward in a calm and objective way, notwithstanding that we know that the basic position or principles from which Senator Harradine starts in addressing these issues are very different from our own. He starts with a prima facie belief in the inappropriateness of this particular strategy to deal with poverty and the wrongness, in principle, of these sorts of programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Harradine starts from that position, but that is absolutely no reason for me or anyone else to question the legitimacy of his concerns, his motives and the accuracy of his material in drawing attention to particular examples of worrying, coercive practices. We will look at that material on its own merits. We simply ask Senator Harradine to look at the material that we do our best to produce in reply on its own merits without quite such a disposition to be concerned about the starting point of the people in question. I hope that we can leave it at that at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can assure Senator Harradine that I will continue to be concerned about evidence of coercive practices, whether it occurs in China, Indonesia or anywhere else. I will continue to be concerned to maximise the effectiveness of the international strategies--political and otherwise--to deal with the situation as it arises. But I will not be deterred from a position of basic support for the legitimacy of population policies generally. The question is how they are implemented, not the inherent policies themselves. Maybe we differ on that. </PARA>

Could the Committee have the details of the advertisements that were placed, who was involved in the selection process and how many applications were received for all of the proposals which were given to me last night?  Also, why does AIDAB not print other views, whether they be political views or otherwise?  Why does it confine itself to this particular line which is pursued constantly by AIDAB and its contractors?  I would also like to know whether the human rights section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade made this recommendation, and whether it suggested that somebody outside that section investigate the area of human rights. If so, how does it distinguish violation of human rights on the grounds of a one child per family policy from violation of human rights on the grounds of the Government of China's opposition to trade unions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As to the last question, I am not aware of the precise views or role that the human rights branch of my Department might have had in this particular matter. I will do my best to find out and advise Senator Harradine subsequently, to the extent that it is relevant. It is worth saying that the branch head, Mr Sheppard, was a member of the human rights delegation that went to China. A unanimous report is being prepared by that delegation, of which he is a member. To the extent that there are views expressed on these issues in that report, they are supposed to be taken as the views of, at least, the branch head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As to why AIDAB publishes material with the line it does, all I can say is that it is the best professional judgment of the AIDAB officers involved that this material properly reflects the factual situation on the ground and the kind of policy perspectives that we think are appropriate. If that is what they want to publish, it is essentially their role and responsibility to do that. It is for others who take the view that such a set of conclusions or approaches is misconceived, wrong or inadequate to say so publicly, as Senator Harradine has no hesitation in doing. But AIDAB is a professional expert agency, and I have to leave it to its best judgment as to how to address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  Again, I do not want to get into the substance of this, except to say that all the material which has been produced in this respect does show a sensitivity to problems of coercion. There may be different conclusions about how those problems can be best addressed, but at least there is some sensitivity there. AIDAB may have as a fundamental premise the validity of population policies, which is a premise different from that which Senator Harradine brings to these discussions, but that, again, is a matter of judgment which can be tested in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to the competitive process that was involved in Dr Hull's selection to do these projects, yes, we will make that information available. The amount was less than the threshold at which public advertisements are required but that is not to say the process is not competitive and not transparent. The details of that will be made available to Senator Harradine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It may well have been, but I have been away. I turn to my final question in relation to what is known as `Africa other' and the response that AIDAB gave to my question about sub Sahara Africa. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What activities will be supported under this vote for 1991-92?  Which activities have not been restored following a decrease in funding under this vote for 1990-91?</PARA>
<PARA>The bottom line that AIDAB is giving to us is this:</PARA>
<PARA>Due to budgetary constraints new funds were not approved in 1991-92 for further phases of the Southern Zone project in Ethiopia and the Regional African Grain Management Program. Support has not been recommended this year for either activity as Australia fully met its commitments through to the conclusion of the relevant phases of these projects. </PARA>
<PARA>What I am seeking from the Minister is information as to why there has been a shift from aid to this particular part of Africa. Last year the Minister expressed concern about the need through budgetary constraints to cut development assistance aid in this particular area of Africa--which I understand is called `Africa other' these days. Given the fact that the situation in Ethiopia and Eritrea shows greater promise today than it has for many years, why cannot the Government restore to this particular area the level of funding that it had three years ago?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I do not think Senator Harradine will be surprised to hear that the problem is essentially budgetary and a question of priorities. We have had significant commitments building up over the years--more particularly in the last two or three years--in southern Africa with our commitment first to allocate and then to maintain this very substantial $110m over three years to activities in southern Africa and, in particular, South Africa. That has created huge stress on our capacity to give funding elsewhere on the scale that we would ideally like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are under pressure with the aid budget with draw-downs from the international financial institutions and subventions coming in larger dollops almost every year. That pressure is immense. We are also under political pressure to confine aid to our own region, to the Pacific and to South East Asia, and not to do any aid funding at all in Africa, other than perhaps some humanitarian crisis funding around the edges. If there were more political support within the country, including from across the chamber, that might assist the kinds of objectives that Senator Harradine has in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>  A few days ago, Mr Fischer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia, said on radio that when we poured aid into certain countries elsewhere in the world--he was referring to those outside our own immediate region--some of those funds ended up in the Swiss bank accounts of the dictators in the areas involved and some ended up in political agendas of consequence. He said that he felt strongly about this and that the coalition would cut back the size of the foreign aid program. I refer to that not in order to score any cheap political points, but to make the point that there is a disposition--grotesque on the part of some elements of the Opposition, but also existing elsewhere in the community--not to have any sympathy at all for the development needs of these African countries and to say that that is entirely somebody else's business. That is not the position that we have adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have tried very hard to keep a significant aid program going in areas of Africa other than just southern Africa, which is obviously a legitimate preoccupation at the present time. We will continue to try to do that, but in the budgetary environment that we face, it is impossible to fund everything on the scale that we would like. I cannot offer a more extended set of reasons than that. We have to set priorities, beginning as we have with our obligations to the multilateral bodies and then to multilateral and bilateral aid to our own region. There is very little money left to devote to anywhere else in the world, including the areas that Senator Harradine refers to. We will do our best. I know that Dr Blewett is trying very hard to find ways of keeping some of these projects going, but that is the best we can do at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA>  My question was focused on Eritrea and Ethiopia. The position there, as the Minister will be well aware with his foreign affairs cap, is that there is great political hope in that area. If we accept that problems of poverty are very much political, then the problems of poverty in Zaire are very much political; and the problems of poverty and starvation in Ethiopia have been very much political.

This gives us enormous hope and encouragement because one item in this year's allocation was $300,000 which was directly to support Professor Hollows' program in that country or in that part of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I should say that the other Africa program aid went up, in fact, from $3m to $3.2m in the shift from 1990-91 to 1991-92. In addition, emergency assistance aid has been maintained. The level of assistance to the Horn of Africa and to Mozambique and Malawi in 1991-92 will be similar to that of last year, but the full amount of that is yet to be determined. </PARA>

No such report has been made available to the Committee in time for the Estimates and the report has not been received, in fact, in time for this Appropriations debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Mr Chairman, you would be well aware of the fact that the Senate does not view with much favour departments that are unable to get an annual report to the Senate in time for this important annual debate. I would hope for an explanation as to why the Department of Defence has not provided its annual report this year to the Senate by now. I also wish to raise some matters relating to the ready reserves. Perhaps the Minister might like to respond to the annual report after I deal with the ready reserves issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yesterday, during the second reading debate, I spoke on the question of the force structure review. Of course, I have spoken on the force structure review many times in this Parliament since the Minister made his statement last May. I have also taken every opportunity that I have been able to get publicly outside the Parliament to talk about the matter because the Opposition has very serious concerns as to what is happening to the defence of this country as a result of force structure review. I do not intend to go on at</PARA>
<PARA>any length about that now except to flag that our concerns have not been satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to the Ready Reserve. During the Estimate Committee hearings we asked a number of detailed questions about the Ready Reserve and particularly about costings. Although I do not intend to pursue this matter now, it remains a contentious issue which I do not think will be resolved until the figures are in. </PARA>
<PARA>  Today I want to talk about what happens after the money has been spent; after the reservists have actually been trained. What guarantees do we have to ensure that they will stay and do what they have been trained and paid to do? The answer is simple: we have no guarantees. There is no legislation in place to ensure that trained and paid ready reservists will be required to render the specified service that the Government has set down for them in its new force structure. They do not have a return of service obligation. One wonders how this could have been introduced without the taxpayers' interests being protected. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has always surprised me how easy it is for a government to spend other people's money without concern for what happens after it has been spent. This Government spends a great deal of money on paying for the final year of education, often an honours year, of promising university students who are brought into government departments as cadets after they have graduated. But there is no obligation on those who win this final year of government sponsorship and financial gain to take a cadetship in a government department. I have heard of some students who have never even been to Canberra and set foot in the department which sponsored them, although they retained all the payments and were given a Public Service number, associated benefits and accrued holiday leave. </PARA>
<PARA>  It strikes me that the Ready Reserve incentives are in the same league--a lot of dollars are being thrown about with no guarantees. This worries me because I have heard that the majority of ready reservists already enlisted were unemployed before entry. I understand that this is the case with the majority of those who made formal applications. I wonder whether they will stay around after the recession lifts or whether they will go back into their chosen career options. </PARA>
<PARA>  What worries me further is the sloppy approach by the Government and by senior military officers who claim that the ready reservists can serve overseas in peacekeeping activities such as those in Cambodia. Minister Bilney and General Gration have both said this publicly. Minister Bilney in his press release of 3 October said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by replacing two, understrength, under-equipped Regular battalions with three, fully manned and equipped Ready Reserve battalions--able to be deployed, including overseas on the same basis as Regulars. </PARA>
<PARA>The Mercury of 3 October states:</PARA>
<PARA>  The Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, said Ready Reserve personnel would be equipped after 12 months of training to handle overseas deployment. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that is simply not true. At least, it will not be true unless an amendment is made to the Defence Act. I have been told that this is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  Call-out of the Army Reserve under the Defence Act is defined under sections 50E and 50F and it applies to the Ready Reserve as part of the Army Reserve. Section 50E defines call-out in a time of war or defence emergency and section 50F defines call-out in a time other than in a time of war or defence emergency. By this definition, peacekeeping would obviously fall under section 50F but, in both sections, call-out can occur only where the Governor-General considers it desirable  to do so  for  the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the Act, the phrase `the defence of Australia' is not defined. However, it would be reasonable to assume that United Nations peacekeeping is not undertaken for the defence of Australia. Certainly, this would be open to challenge. An important point to remember is that Australian reservists who serve overseas in any capacity, as they did in the Gulf war and in peacekeeping in Namibia, are individual volunteers. They are not called up. The concept is one of Ready Reserve units replacing regular battalions, not individual reserves filling places in regular units. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now turn to questions that I would like to ask the Minister in relation to the legislative backing for the Ready Reserve. My first question is: if we are to rely on ready reservists to volunteer, how can the Government guarantee that whole Ready Reserve units will volunteer?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think three issues have been raised by Senator Newman. I understand that Senator Newman asked why the Department of Defence annual report is not available. Our progress on this is still ahead of last year's progress. We are awaiting an audit certificate before it can be put forward. I recall briefly for the record that last year we managed to win the prize for the best annual report of the year. I note that the corporate plan was also provided to senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Newman raises the question, `Well, how can they guarantee ready reservists continuing with their four-year obligation?'. In actual fact, we have a section to compel but we do not believe that that is necessary. We believe that the incentives given to ready reservists to stay in the four-year service are both generous and attractive and will meet our objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final point that Senator Newman has raised concerns legislative backing if we wish to use ready reservists. Not being a lawyer, I am not going to try to interpret the Act in immense detail other than to say that we have looked at it and we believe it is sufficient. There may be some doubt on this. However, in that context, I announced some time ago that we already have planned a review of conscientious objection. A Bill will be introduced into this chamber to revise call-out provisions, many of which, as I think Senator Newman would realise, are archaic, are almost racist in tone, go back many years and have not been touched. So, if the view were to prevail, and it has not yet, that there was some doubt about power in this respect, that will be able to be remedied, I hope, in the autumn session next year when the Bill will be before us. </PARA>

But there is no requirement now, as I understand it, and, as I said by way of introduction, I would dispute his understanding of the legal position. I think the Government would find very great difficulty in compelling people to serve in something like a peacekeeping activity. In this case, the Army is not training individual reservists; it is training units. Units would be required to be sent to serve as part of a peacekeeping force. Therefore, it is no good if the Army gets people only in dribs and drabs. What is it going to do about that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>  As I have also said, if there is any difficulty about this, if the new Act is introduced by the autumn session next year--and even Senator Newman would concede this--it will well and truly cover the situation because the first ready reservists will complete their full year service in January the following year. We will have a look at that. We have already had a look at it, but there is no harm in re-checking. I will refer Senator Newman's view, as expressed today, to my Department's officers for evaluation.

<PARA>  My concern is that there was a great flourish when, in May, I remind you, Mr Chairman, the Government's force structure review was introduced. It heavily relied on replacing regular units with Ready Reserve units. We have the Ready Reserve trumpeted around the country by this Government as being the solution to Australia's defence and then we find, many months down the track--five months or something like it--that no information is available to the Parliament on how the obligations of these people will be honoured. </PARA>
<PARA>  I find it quite unsatisfactory that the Minister can come in here and cannot tell us precisely what he is going to do. One would have expected that that would be decided before the Ready Reserve concept was announced. It is not only a question of the legislative arrangements; it is also a question of the employer incentives. Clearly, they were not determined and appear to be still not finalised. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is unsatisfactory to have an ad hoc defence force being organised as it goes. It does not lead to any confidence as to the sort of force the Government is going to produce, let alone its ability to defend the country. If this is any indication of the way Defence and the Government have been organising to have Australia defended, I find it totally unsatisfactory. It is but perhaps a symptom, but it is a symptom that gives me great concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I doubt that people would be discriminated against in this sense, any more than any reservist could be discriminated against, but it is a two-way street. Having done the year's training, many of the ready reservists will be a more attractive employment proposition even though the employer will have to release them for two two-week blocks. That is, by sticking out a year's training, by--probably, in many cases, for the first time in their lives--getting into a routine, they will absorb some of the qualities that employers look towards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That was certainly my impression when talking to some of the employers who came to the one launch, at least, that I was involved in.

<PARA>  I think it would be quite difficult to legislate to protect against discrimination in employment. Nevertheless, I am happy to look at it. I think it would be quite difficult to put in legislation criteria that covered why a person was rejected for a job. It would be difficult to prove why they were rejected. It has been tried in other areas, as the honourable senator would know--especially in affirmative action programs and in many other contexts. It is not an easy thing to do.

I am sure the honourable senator has constituents in the age group of 45 to 55 years who are eminently employable, but all of the job advertisements ask for a younger person or the excuse is given that they are over-qualified for the job.</PARA></TALK.START>

If it does emerge, the Government may take remedial action. It will be difficult action to take, but I am not saying that we will not take it. But I stress that when two 20-year-olds walk into an employer's office it may be that on many occasions the person who has been through a year's full time military training will get the job over and above the other person because the employer knows that person has had to show a regular form of discipline. I am not talking about Colonel Blimp-type discipline here; I am talking about the sorts of things that the armed forces demand and get. It is no surprise to me that, after a year's training, people come out with all sorts of different social and organisational skills which enable them to organise their own lives.

<PARA>a.  Acquire small stocks of stand-off weapons for the F-111C. </PARA>
<PARA>b.  For the first time, use twelve reserve F-111C crews to supplement the number of regular crews in the event of contingencies (and reduce the number of regular crews by three). </PARA>
<PARA>I think the figure for reductions in air regular crews has been taken into account. I do not know what the exact figure is, but that does not matter. During the Estimates process, I asked a question--No. 164--to the effect, `Can you provide me with a breakdown of the training you plan to provide Ready Reserve pilots for the strike reconnaissance force?'. I received an answer which stated that there are no plans to include air crews in the RAAF Ready Reserve element. Therefore, technically, the answer is none. The answer continued that a program was being implemented which would provide training for selected ex-regular F111 air crew who are members of the general Reserve, as I understand it, involving two days training once a year. I am concerned that there seems to be a major discrepancy between what is said in the force structure review and what has been said in the answer to me. Perhaps the Minister can clear this up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I refer to the M113 project. During the Estimates Committee hearings Vice-Admiral Beaumont stated that ground mobility for the Army was a high priority and had been for some time. I disputed that. I said that the high priority must have been given only recently because I had asked about it for some years and had been given the impression that it was on the back burner. I have since looked back at previous Estimates Hansards and seen that my observations were correct. In the Additional Estimates of 1989, when speaking about defence development I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Am I to assume the M113 project is dead?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Brabin-Smith answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No. I would not assume that. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Do I assume it is still on the back-burner?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Brabin-Smith answered:</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it is fair to say it is not on the front-burner, yes. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Budget Estimates of October 1988 I asked about ground mobility priority. No-one said then that it had any priority. It has not always been a priority, as Vice-Admiral Beaumont would have us believe. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would ask about the mobile ground forces, if that is a priority capability area how mobile are they going to be if we are not prepared to do something about the M113s? Have we taken a decision about that?</PARA>
<PARA>Vice-Admiral Knox answered:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a decision has not yet been made on the upgrading of the M113 vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, in Budget Estimates in October 1987 I asked about the status of the M113s. Mr Ives said:</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it study is going on as to what we will do next. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked whether that meant it had slipped. I was told by General Francis:</PARA>
<PARA>It depends how you define slippage, it will probably be approved later than we originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked when it was originally hoped it would start. General Francis said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have forgotten. It would have been in the Budget just presented. </PARA>
<PARA>That went on. Answers such as those that I have just quoted give no indication of priority. If ground mobility was a priority issue, answers such as `I have forgotten' and `study is going on as to what we will do next' just do not fit in. In fact, we get the impression that it was being stalled, especially when Dr Brabin-Smith said that there was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no delay due to lack of money in the implementation of the modernisation of the M113s . . .</PARA>
<PARA>If the delay was not a question of money, was it delayed because it was not a priority issue?</PARA>
<PARA>  If ground mobility has not had priority, despite Vice-Admiral Beaumont's claims that it has, why has it not had priority, given that its priority in the White Paper seems pretty clear. The White Paper stated under the heading `Australia's defence strategy':</PARA>
<PARA>Defence in depth gives priority to the ability of the ADF to mount operations of defeating the enemy forces in our area of direct military interest. This means that we must have forces capable of tracking and targeting the adversary . . . having a comprehensive range of defensive capabilities including air defence, mine countermeasures and protection of coastal trade--and embodying mobile land forces able to defeat hostile incursions at remote locations. </PARA>
<PARA>The White Paper further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Within this planning framework, priority capability areas include--</PARA>
<PARA>after surveillance, maritime forces, mine countermeasures, ground reconnaissance and surveillance--</PARA>
<PARA>mobile ground forces able to defeat hostile incursions at remote localities and protect military and infrastructure assets that support the projection of our maritime power. </PARA>
<PARA>Although it was clearly stated in 1987 in the White Paper that that was something we had to be able to achieve, never in successive Estimates committee hearings has the mobility of ground forces had any sense of urgency or priority. I was astounded when I was told in the Estimates Committee hearings that, somehow, this was a matter of high priority. It clearly is not; it clearly has not been. There has been no sense of urgency about the M113 upgrade. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are going off on a frolic occasioned by the Minister Beazley when, instead of borrowing one of the Canadian light armoured vehicles for the Kangaroo 89 exercise, he suddenly had a rush of blood to the head and there was some June money left in the Budget and he bought 15. That is another matter which will be taken up by my colleagues Senator Durack and Senator MacGibbon. </PARA>
<PARA>  We cannot allow the LAV procurement to distract us from the basic need to upgrade the M113s. The fact is that the Senate Estimates Committee has, over several years now, been given the clear impression that this has not been given the priority that it should have in the Department of Defence and that the Government obviously does not see any need to implement statements made quite clearly in its White Paper. What are we going to do about ground mobility for the defence forces? Are we going to rely entirely on the LAVs or are we going to do something about the M113s? When did the M113 project get the priority that Vice-Admiral Beaumont claimed it had during the Estimates Committee hearings? Just what is the reality of that priority? What is happening to the M113s?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It would be wrong, of course, to assert that Army mobility and the M113 are synonymous, and only by themselves. Mobility, in that sense, has been affected enormously by the Black Hawk program, by the hundreds of trucks and the Mack program. I think there are something like 1,800 Unimog trucks. I saw the 1,800th roll out last year. There are the Perentie vehicles, the Land Rovers and there will be the LAV 25s. I do not think Senator Newman meant to assert that Army mobility is simply a matter of the M113 vehicle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In response to her question No. 6, we have indicated that there will be an upgrade of those vehicles between 1994 and 1998, at a cost of about $40m. If Senator Newman is asking me to adjudicate past bouts at Estimates committees going back to 1987, I have not read that material so I am not in a position to comment on it. I am more concerned with the present and future than with the past although I agree that the past has some relevance to planning. There is a major degree of emphasis in the Army now on its mobility and the lessons that have been learnt from various exercises. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, I would not restrict a view of Army mobility just to the tracking vehicles. There are numerous other vehicles that have been purchased. I had a ride in one of the new tank carriers the other day. They were very impressive acquisitions in terms of Army mobility.  Finally, Senator Newman asked when we could move onto the tracking vehicles program and the answer is 1994 to 1998 for the upgrade at a cost of $40m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think two issues are involved. The first relates to the time the submarine spent in the dockyard. It is expected to turn around a vessel in 85 to 90 weeks in general. If they were to delay that process while the ship was in dock, it would be to their disadvantage, not ours. The delay in putting the ships into dock was caused by a multitude of reasons, some of which were crewing reasons. Some may have been due to the fact that I wanted to put that particular contract under scrutiny, which I did when I became Minister. The changeover in Ministers would have had some effect. I understand that there are some crewing reasons for that sort of timing, and we are undermanned in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It has to be broken up into two sections. As to the time the vessel spends in dock, everyone said that the last submarine to come out of Cockatoo would be late, but it was not. If Garden Island cannot deliver within the specified time, in what is regarded as a reasonable time, it will cost it rather than the Government, as I understand it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I understand that the Commonwealth must bear the loss of service while the ship is under dockyard refit. But my question relates to the period of roughly 14 months before the submarines, both the Otama and Onslow, entered the dockyard. In so far as one imposes a penalty on the dockyard for exceeding the contract overhaul or refit time, I would argue that there is therefore an economic penalty also through the loss of service to the Navy in not having use of those two submarines when they were lying tied up to the wharf for a period of about 14 months before they entered the dockyard. I am asking whether the Commonwealth will recover from the dockyard for that period of inactivity, or whether that is accepted as a Navy responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

But there are a multitude of reasons, some resolvable and some not resolvable, for that delay. We did not enter into a contract only to be told that we had to wait another six months before we could put the ship into the dock. That simply did not occur in this process.

One thing we have had to resolve with the closing of Cockatoo is that we did not have the same continuity when we went to a new bidder. It often depends on whether the contract is for one submarine or several submarines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The question concerning the current class of Oberons is virtually resolved. The two we have mentioned here today are going through and then that is it. When the Government and the Navy get to the Collins class, there will be a need for very stringent programming into the future. There will be a very strong argument to have one contractor so that we can plan into the future to make sure that maximum use is made of assets. That will be very important. It could be complicated if we go for the Sterling engines down the track. Nevertheless, the sort of philosophy that Senator MacGibbon is putting forward in terms of timing is a good one.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2136" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, I have seen concerns by judges of the New South Wales Industrial Commission reported in at least two newspapers, and I quote from the report in front of me:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Angry judges from the New South Wales Industrial Commission are threatening to quit because of changes to their roles proposed by the Government's Industrial Relations Bill. Judges fear their judicial independence would be compromised by the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>The report says further:</PARA>
<PARA>The dissatisfied judges say changes to the system will defy constitutional convention. They say `they are not out to. . . sabotage the system but want a guarantee from the Government to discuss a workable arrangement'.</PARA>
<PARA>In these reports as well, Mr Barry O'Keefe, the President of the New South Wales Bar Association, queries the constitutional base upon which the New South Wales legislation is based. He argues that it has serious constitutional consequences for the independence of the judiciary and for the protection of citizens' rights in the courts. It is also reported that the New South Wales Industrial Relations Minister, John Fahey, wrote to the Commission President, Mr Bill Fisher, saying that amendments proposed by judges to the Bill were unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is not just the judges in New South Wales who are concerned about the New South Wales Industrial Relations Bill. I quote Mr Geoff Huard, the Anglican Archdeacon of Sydney:</PARA>
<PARA>We must guard against the pendulum swinging too far. To allow this Bill free passage would be simply to swap one set of work problems for another.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote William Patterson, the executive director of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation, an employer body:</PARA>
<PARA>Threats of heavy fines against employers and unions, voluntary union membership and enterprise agreements are theoretical exercises which I see as creating, not settling, industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>The Reverend Harry Herbert of the Uniting Church says:</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales industrial relations Bill is likely to produce an upsurge in the exploitation of workers.</PARA>
<PARA>The Catholics for Justice and Peace say:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed legislation further disadvantages workers. We urge you to withdraw this unjust legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The leader of the New South Wales Democrats, Elisabeth Kirkby, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The wages and conditions of workers in low paid, low status jobs would be devastated.</PARA>
<PARA>An Independent, Mr John Hatton, says:</PARA>
<PARA>My grandchildren and their grandchildren will suffer third world working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>Doug Wright, the New South Wales executive director of the Metal Trades Industry Association, an employer body, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will give unscrupulous employers an opportunity to exploit workers in a recessed economy.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the concerns of judges echoed by the churches, by employers and by politicians. Certainly, one knows from the record that unions are strongly opposed to this legislation. I am concerned that this is an attempt to import into Australia the industrial regulation that applies in New Zealand, exploitative legislation that it be. I am concerned as well that the strike figures for the Australian national performance will now be worsened because of the Greiner Government's inability to manage sensible industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am concerned that this Bill is seriously flawed and it should be withdrawn. It uses phrases like `enterprise bargaining' to cloak an ideological agenda. The effect on the Federal industrial relations system is hard to gauge at this stage, although I have been pursuing a program of voluntary integration of the State and Federal commissions. As a consequence of that program I have elevated the President of the New South Wales Industrial Commission, His Honour Mr Justice Bill Fisher, QC, to a Deputy President of the Federal Commission. I do not think it is appropriate to comment on the effect that that might have at this stage when it is merely a Bill because it is appropriate, only when it becomes law, for me to comment on what the impact on the Federal Commission might be. Suffice it for me to say in these circumstances, though, that I hope commonsense prevails, that the overwhelming voice of the community is heard by the New South Wales Government, that the Government takes off its ideological blinkers and sees the wider issues and that the Government pulls this Bill out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Can the Minister help allay the concerns of many Australian women regarding silicone breast implants, particularly given Monday night's Four Corners program on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2137" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Concerns about silicone breast implants, as portrayed on the Four Corners program on Monday night, have also found a similar voice in Canada and the United States. This has prompted action by the various governments to obtain advice from the manufacturers to justify the quality and safety of these devices. The Therapeutic Goods Administration wrote to all manufacturers of breast implants in July seeking such justification by 30 November this year. Since almost all breast implants are imported from the United States, this action is being taken in conjunction and cooperation with the United States Food and Drug Administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As in the United States, it is likely that some companies will withdraw their products from the market or be required to withdraw through failure to submit information. The polyurethane coated implant which was the subject of much concern in the Four Corners program was withdrawn from Australia and worldwide by the company in April. In Australia we have presently exempted saline filled prostheses from this review of safety and quality and we will be pushing manufacturers to use water based fillings.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is the responsibility of the medical profession to ensure that patients are fully informed about the risks associated with breast implants. The ABC program The Investigators on Tuesday, 8 October highlighted the Government's therapeutic device problem reporting scheme, established to provide an avenue to alert regulatory authorities about problems that patients experience with medical devices. Patients who experience a problem with such medical devices can call in on a hotline in respect of their concern.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is committed to increasing the role of women in the therapeutic devices area--a crucial area of women's health. To this end, over the past 12 months, the Minister has increased the representation of women members on the Therapeutic Device Evaluation Committee from one to four. I believe that should ameliorate some of the concerns of women in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Has the Minister seen reports that Japanese companies are looking for `guaranteed profits' before they will invest in the multifunction polis? In view of the Minister's earlier assurance that no Government money would be used in the MFP, how will he guarantee profits for Japanese investors in the MFP?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I understand that Senator Coulter no longer has responsibility for economic matters in his portfolio, and I suppose that is a little progress. Because Senator Coulter saw some reports in, I think, the Adelaide Advertiser that Japanese companies were asking for particular incentives, that is no reason for changing this Government's established position on the issue of incentives in relation to the MFP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have explained that a dozen times. I have referred Senator Coulter a few times to the principles which were behind the MFP process, as enunciated by the Commonwealth and State governments, and Senator Coulter ought to be aware of them. He has a bit of an obsession with all of this. He ought to be aware of the need to follow through his obsessions from time to time and be factually accurate in what he says. The answer to the question, as a result of a report in the Adelaide Advertiser, is simply that no change will be made to the policy enunciated by the two governments--indeed, the seven governments of Australia--in relation to this issue.</PARA>

I refer the Minister to the Deputy General Manager of the International Division of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Mr Matsuo Shimojima, who said that Japanese companies would not go to the MFP to do something for Adelaide. In light of those calls for guaranteed profits, is the Minister saying that if the Japanese companies are asking for guaranteed profits this Government and other governments will not guarantee those profits and, therefore, the MFP is a non-goer?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security and refers to the claim by the Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, in a speech to the Australian Council of Social Service congress on 4 October that ACOSS has a budget of $700,000 and receives $500,000 of this through Commonwealth funding. Is this correct?  How many staff are employed by ACOSS? Is it a large bureaucracy, as implied by Dr Hewson?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am not dealing with the consumption tax at the moment; we will get to that. The question concerns the ACOSS budget, which is a lot less than $700,000--in fact, it is less than $600,000; it is $580,000-odd, of which less than $350,000 comes from the Commonwealth. The claims were fundamentally wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On the claim that ACOSS might be a big bureaucracy, I do not think that that sort of claim stands much analysis either. If one looks at those on the board of governors of ACOSS, all are unpaid, including the President. All of the spokespersons for ACOSS--the policy resource coordinators, as they are called--are also unpaid. This huge bureaucracy, this bureaucracy run wild, has six full time staff and three part time staff. Temporary and casual staff can be employed from time to time for specific projects. We would hardly call this government largesse funding a big bureaucracy--far from it.</PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously, neither Dr Hewson nor Senator Alston have much idea of how our welfare groups work. While I know that Senator Alston had not expected the outburst from Dr Hewson, it is interesting to note that Senator Alston had to attempt to retrieve the situation by writing to welfare groups. Amazingly, in attempting to do that, he referred to the criticism of ACOSS by Dr Hewson in its role as a political lobby group when in fact Dr Hewson in his speech had said, `This is a time for the welfare sector'--note the words `welfare sector'--`no less than every other part of Australian society to face a few home truths'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I can understand why Senator Kemp does not want to hear this. On 10 October the Age newspaper reported that it had received letters from the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Wesley Mission and the Federation of Australian Jewish Welfare Societies expressing concern about Dr Hewson's comments. The following day the Australian reported that it had received letters from the National Anglican Caring Society, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Salvation Army and the Committee for Social Responsibility and Justice of the Uniting Church, all regretting Dr Hewson's comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition was not going too well in its claims about ACOSS and its role as a peak body. I think it is important to understand that the Parliament itself has had an examination of ACOSS and the peak bodies in the health and community affairs area. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs heaped praise on ACOSS for this very same role of coordination and leadership.</PARA>

<PARA>In addition to having perhaps the broadest range of interests of all organisations with which the inquiry is concerned, ACOSS also takes a leading role in high level government negotiations, on major government committees and in public campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as the last part of Senator Zakharov's question is concerned, the Government will not stop funding groups simply because they criticise government policies. In fact, it is quite obvious that the attack on ACOSS by Dr Hewson and Senator Alston was due to the fact that it dared to criticise the consumption tax. ACOSS has criticised Newstart, the disability reform package and government policy many times, but we would prefer to seek to talk to ACOSS about its concerns rather than simply bag it or threaten to take away the very meagre funding that it receives.</PARA>
<PARA>  In fact, the National Trust of Australia has criticised the Government on occasions, as have the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission. What are we to do?

<PARA>  I have some material which may be of assistance in relation to pathology services. For example, in paper No. 6, Directions for Pathology, of the health strategy, chapter 2 examined the rate of utilisation of pathology services by the extent to which the services were direct billed by the pathologist. That analysis showed that in 1988-89, 55.6 per cent of pathology services were direct billed. The proportion was lower for patients with four pathology services or less and for those with the highest use of over 24 services a year on average. Between these extremes, direct billing varied from 56 per cent to 61.3 per cent of services. However, there was no relationship between the volume of services ordered per patient and the proportion of services which were direct billed.</PARA>
<PARA>  The health strategy paper on pathology also showed that there was very little difference in the number of pathology episodes per patient; the number of pathology services per episode; and the number of pathology services per patient between patients who were direct billed for all pathology services and those patients billed for all pathology services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Is the Minister aware of the fact that a parliamentary inquiry is under way in New Zealand following concerns that the cost of the two Anzac class frigates has leapt from $674m to $871m and that New Zealand firms were not receiving their guaranteed share of the work on the frigates?  In light of this inquiry, I ask the Minister whether he can assure the Senate that there are no cost overruns on the Anzac class frigates given that, under the agreement with New Zealand, any additional costs will be borne by the Australian Government. I further ask whether the Minister agrees with the assessment of Gwyn Prins from the Cambridge University global security program that, given the changes in the security environment following the end of the East-West confrontation in the Pacific, the Anzac class frigates should be replaced with a larger number of smaller ships which have longer endurance and less emphasis on high-tech weapons and which would be more relevant in combating low level threats to Australia's security. Finally, I ask the Minister: what strategic reassessment is under way of Australia's security position following the changes in relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, and whether he believes that financing six submarines costing $5.6 billion and eight frigates costing $3.5 billion is the best way to spend such a high proportion of our defence dollar?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Panizza does raise an issue which is of concern and that concern is obviously reflected by the article in yesterday's newspaper to which he referred. The Gyles Royal Commission has not as yet completed its final hearings on the reference relating to tendering matters. However, my Department has been in liaison with the Commission and, through a departmental officer and through other avenues, has been keeping a watching brief in respect of that particular hearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On 7 June, during previous hearings on this reference, the Royal Commission advised the Australian Construction Services that evidence concerning collusive tendering practices on several Commonwealth projects would, in fact, be heard. We were advised that they would be heard the following week. We then briefed counsel and counsel was granted leave to appear.</PARA>
<PARA>  What has emerged in evidence during the Commission's hearings is that collusive practices had been widespread in private projects and, of course, in State and Commonwealth public works projects. The practice, I am advised, as has been indicated by the evidence, has been occurring for a long time. According to one witness it may have been going on for something like 35 years. The evidence also, I am advised, indicates that the practices are probably Australia-wide and have been effectively concealed from government and private clients.</PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of the practices that we are talking about, there are probably four categories: firstly, agreements to pay fees to unsuccessful tenderers and to conceal those payments by the issue of false invoices; secondly, agreements to pay special fees to the Master Builders Association and/or the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors; thirdly, agreements that both parties would add the same amounts to their tenders to allow for the two preceding areas of costs; and, fourthly, various other collusive practices.</PARA>
<PARA>  This information is not new. It has been before the Commission and I think it was canvassed by the media some four to six weeks ago, if not further back than that. The evidence does lead to concern on our level that there may have been breaches of several Commonwealth laws. I think Senator Panizza would understand that since these matters are under investigation by not only relevant Commonwealth agencies, but also by the Commission, then it is not appropriate for me to make any further comment at this time.</PARA>
<PARA>  In terms of preventive measures, however, the New South Wales Government has instituted a requirement for tenderers and contractors to provide statutory declarations on these matters. I am informed that these have had some measure of success in this respect, although the sanctions available to the Commonwealth for non-compliance--if we were to do the same thing--are not as powerful. I have decided that suitable declarations will be requested from tenderers for all Commonwealth public work projects over $2m. I will be requesting that government business enterprises adopt the same tendering practice.</PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of my Department, we have seconded a senior officer to assist in these matters over and above the person we have briefed. Mr Tim Robinson briefed his counsel to appear before the Commission. We have seconded a senior officer to assist in these matters and to provide liaison with the various agencies including the proposed building and construction industry reform agency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am aware of reports along the lines that Senator Beahan refers to--that the Khmer Rouge has, among other things, replaced the elected administration of the Cambodian refugee camp at site eight in south-east Thailand and appears to be preparing for the forcible repatriation of the camp's inhabitants across the border into Khmer Rouge controlled Cambodian territory. The senior camp administrators, who are themselves members of the Khmer Rouge, were summoned to a Khmer Rouge military camp inside Cambodia on 4 October and they have not yet returned. They have been replaced by four new Khmer Rouge appointees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The site eight camp is, of course, a Khmer Rouge controlled camp under the United Nations Border Relief Organisation. The Australian Government can only express its most serious concern at this development. The camp administrators were popularly elected, albeit under Khmer Rouge auspices, and there must be some real fears for their personal safety across the border. I hope that the Thai authorities will act to prevent any forcible repatriation of Cambodians from this camp.</PARA>
<PARA>  The comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian problem, which does provide for an orderly repatriation program to be led and coordinated by the UNHCR, will be finalised in Paris next week. Annex 4 of that settlement clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA>Repatriation of Cambodian refugees and displaced persons should be voluntary and their decision should be taken in full possession of the facts. Choice of destination within Cambodia should be that of the individual. The unity of the family must be preserved.</PARA>
<PARA>On the eve of the signature of that international settlement, the international community must insist that the Khmer Rouge and, indeed, all parties to the forthcoming settlement act fully in accordance with arrangements laid down by the UN peace plan. In this context, I note that Prince Sihanouk has appealed to the resistance parties not to undertake unilateral repatriation of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA>  Let me say finally that while these developments at site eight are certainly matters for concern and justify statements of the kind that I have just made, in no sense do they undermine the credibility of the comprehensive settlement which has now been agreed. The negotiation of that settlement has been a remarkable achievement and, certainly, a signature next week would be a very big milestone. But we have known all along that its implementation will be an extremely difficult and complex task, not least in this area of repatriation of displaced Cambodians. It is very important that the international community continues to focus very closely and very carefully on the implementation phase as well as the negotiation for settlement itself.</PARA>

The position is based on our view that the death penalty is an inhumane form of punishment which violates the most fundamental of all human rights--the right to life.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services to the advertisements by Mutual Community in the papers and on television in South Australia. One of these television ads shows a ski accident with the message that under Medicare one will wait, I think, 10 months but with Mutual Community there will be no wait for treatment. A newspaper advertisement implies that one will go blind waiting for cataract operations under Medicare but not with Mutual Community. Can the Minister say what the facts are about emergency surgery and Medicare provisions? Can he tell the Senate about waiting times for private hospitals? Can he say whether these advertisements might contravene the Trade Practices Act regarding advertising?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My understanding is that the television advertisements in question, which I have not seen, were shown in both South Australia and Victoria. They show a series of sporting accidents and suggest that the treatments for the resultant injuries are elective surgery for which the accident victim would have to wait many months for treatment if he or she were not insured. Such a suggestion is patently absurd. Accident and emergency treatment, unlike elective surgery, is not subject to waiting lists. I am surprised that the health Ministers in Victoria and South Australia have not reacted to this slur on the accident and emergency departments of their hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Similarly with the newspaper advertisement, it is mischievous and a slur on the medical profession to assert that, even where there may be waiting lists for elective ophthalmology, serious cases will not be dealt with according to medical need. The Health Insurance Commission has already referred the complaints it has received about this allegedly misleading advertising to the Trade Practices Commission, which has written to Mutual Community and is seeing its officers today, I believe. The question will be whether the advertisements are misleading and deceptive within the terms of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am unable to provide details of waiting times at private hospitals because the Government does not collect this data, partly because the proprietors of private hospitals treat this information as commercially sensitive and will not provide it to government and partly because the management of surgical lists is in the hands of the treating doctors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I refer the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support to today's Sydney Morning Herald article about claims that, if the third runway is built, aircraft delays and diversions will be far greater than predicted in the EIS. What does this mean for the use of the east-west runway? How would this affect any future plans to downgrade the east-west runway?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I did notice that story spread all over the front page of today's Sydney Morning Herald. I trust that the newspaper will give as much prominence to the facts as it has given to the fiction. I will have the opportunity of discussing this matter with Mr Lockwood, who prepared the report, when I meet him tomorrow, along with a number of other anti-third runway people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The claims that Mr Lockwood made are fairly dramatic, that is, that the EIS is fundamentally flawed in that the east-west runway will not be taken out of service and that the actual percentage of aircraft movements that will have to continue on the east-west runway because of adverse wind conditions at the airport will be `a minimum' of 23 per cent up to 30 per cent of aircraft movements.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have no difficulty at all with Mr Lockwood's data on the actual wind conditions at Sydney Airport, but there are fundamental flaws in the assumption that he made in leaping to the conclusions that he has based on that data. Principally those flaws are found in the assumptions he has made on the cross-wind tolerances of the aircraft that utilise Sydney; the overly conservative criteria that he has used for the cross-wind conditions of the airport; and the assumptions he has made about the time for which Sydney Airport is subject to instrument landing conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>  To indicate how dramatically flawed this information is, rather than the theoretical models used by Mr Lockwood, I rely on the statistics--the data from the control tower at the airport--about the actual number of actual movements of actual aircraft that have had to be diverted to the east-west runway because of weather conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>  I should like to refer briefly to the information which is contained in the supplement to the EIS. I refer to table 10.3 which is contained on page 10-11, which is data on aircraft movements which is actually taken from the tower at Sydney Airport. The table deals with aircraft movements on the east-west runway when the north-south runway was unavailable owing to 20-knot cross-wind conditions. This data has been collected over a three-year period, from 1987 to 1989, and is taken from the tower at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA>  I will not give a detailed breakdown, but the bottom line of this table indicates that the total number of aircraft, that is, jet and non-jet aircraft, that actually had to be diverted to the east-west runway because of these wind conditions over that three-year period represented 1.63 per cent, as distinct from the assertions all over the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald this morning from Mr Lockwood that a minimum of 23 per cent of these movements would mysteriously somehow in the future have to be diverted. Coming from Darwin, I am used to cyclones, but I have not noticed too many in Sydney on a daily basis. I look forward to discussing, with Mr Lockwood when I meet him tomorrow, this data that has been given so much prominence on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald.</PARA>
<PARA>  The facts are that the supplement to the EIS reaffirms the data in the original draft environmental impact statement: that by the year 2010 an average of 99 per cent of all aircraft movements will be able to be safely conducted on the two parallel runways, which will mean that the ongoing need for the east-west runway will be dramatically scaled down.</PARA>
<PARA>  This, of course, is a crucial question, as everyone knows, because the aggregate figures of the reduction in people seriously affected by aircraft noise at Sydney, which is the major environmental issue, are absolutely determined by the removal from operational use of the east-west runway. The position will be that 99 per cent of aircraft will be able to utilise the runways to a position where, by the year 2010, the movements will be reduced on the east-west runway from 72,500 in 1988 to approximately 3,600 in the year 2010.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I direct my question to the Minister for Industrial Relations, who is a strong advocate of the various accords. Why has his Government inflicted wage restraint on Australian workers through the various accords, yet steadfastly refused to implement policies that would enable wage restraint to be turned into productivity growth which, in turn, would provide jobs, job security and an increased standard of living for Australian workers? Why has productivity growth in Australia been so dismally low under the various accords?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The word `inflicted' stands out as a weird word in this context because people know that the accord is what it says: it is an agreement, an accord, between two consenting parties. In this case, one party represents the work force of Australia--the trade union movement--and the other party represents the Government of Australia. It is true that the accord has led to wage restraint. That has been applauded by, among others, the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry and so on. The point that the Opposition, and now Senator Vanstone, appears not to understand is really quite a simple one, and if they apply themselves they will understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The point is that the accord is about living standards; it is not about wage levels. The accord talks about the level of taxation, the benefit of the social wage, the overall questions of equity and fairness in the work force, as well as the wage itself, and takes a holistic, not a narrow, view of what constitutes living standards. Therefore it was that we compensated for reductions in the real wage by cutting taxation; therefore it was that we compensated for wage restraint by introducing Medicare as a major social benefit in the community. By interaction between these two things, most recently in September last year, we bought out an entire wage round--which saved the Australian community and the employers the cost of a wage increase at that time--with a tax cut.</PARA>
<PARA>  The point is that wages growth, as compared with the consumer price index, because of the buying out of the wages round, will appear less but living standards were preserved and the purchasing power of the pockets of wage earners was not reduced. That is the simple point. If the Opposition applies itself, it will see that this is a very sound idea and a way in which an economy such as ours can grow.</PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable senator talks about a productivity increase. We wanted--and submitted to the Industrial Relations Commission in the last national wage case increase--to provide guidelines for direct bargaining in order to facilitate growth and productivity, among other things. The Commission made another decision.</PARA>

He has not answered that part of the question. Do I take it that the Minister denies that productivity growth-- GDP per hour--has been markedly less on average under the Hawke Government than it was under the Fraser Government? Does he deny that it has fallen in six of the last nine quarters? How does he explain its being so poor compared with the OECD performance? How does he explain its being so poor compared with the performance of our Asian trading partners?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is a really laboured question. Senator Vanstone is trying to turn the silk purse of the accord into a sow's ear and failing dismally. The benefit of the accord is best demonstrated in a reduction of unit labour costs in the economy. Those figures, which I do not have to hand, can be adduced. That is one element of what goes to make up productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Last Thursday, Senator Boswell asked a question of my colleague Senator Evans regarding the importing of grain and went on to ask whether wheat growers could initiate anti-dumping measures while the wheat is in transit to Australia. I have obtained an answer to this question because it is relevant to my portfolio. I will refer to only the last part of the answer. The answer is fairly long and I will seek leave to have the whole answer incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The last part of the answer says that last week, at the request of the Minister for Small Business and Customs, the Australian Customs Service spoke with, and wrote to, the Grains Council about the possibility of the Council lodging an application under the anti-dumping legislation. A meeting between the Council and Customs has been arranged for 17 October to further discuss key issues relevant to the Council's claim. I seek leave to incorporate the whole answer in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA>  The answer read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>An anti-dumping case can be mounted against any goods on its way to Australia. The Customs Act 1901 clearly allows for an application to be made on goods likely to be imported.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the application would need to justify the basis of that likelihood. Any advice from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) concerning preliminary applications for import, depending on the nature and timeliness of that advice, may prove sufficient to justify the likelihood of imports.</PARA>
<PARA>Claims have been made that the prospective grain to be imported into Australia would be subsidised. For this, the application would need to show the amount and the form of subsidy. As evidence of this, practice has been that applications provide a copy of the relevant legislative base for payment of the subsidy in the country of export.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of material injury, the application would need to show the likely effect of imports. The legislation sets out relevant considerations in this area.</PARA>

Following the winch breakdown, a revised data collection schedule was developed by the participating scientists. This program is now being followed, subject to weather conditions. The data collected this season will be a valuable contribution to the five-year world ocean circulation experiment, in which Australia is a significant partner.</PARA></TALK.START>

The cost implications of the delays in terms of salaries and so on are still being assessed. During the lay-up period prior to the commencement of the voyage, the vessel had only a caretaker crew aboard. The oceanographic winch was tested statically at the wharf under a simulated load and the owners confirmed to the Antarctic division that they had proved the satisfactory performance of the winch. The legal implications of any costs borne by the Commonwealth as a result of the above problems are currently being examined by the Antarctic division in conjunction with the Office of the Australian Government Solicitor.</PARA>

A number of improvements, the most apparent of which has been the electronic transfer of Pinks to senators' offices, have already been introduced and received positively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A major component of the modernisation project is the introduction of in-house publishing of the Daily and Weekly Hansards.

Hansard then provides camera-ready, fully prepared material to the Australian Government Publishing Service for printing only.</PARA>

<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA>The September Advance to the Minister for Finance--we have to take document No. 3 and document No. 4 together--contains some very major items of expenditure, some of which are explainable in terms of the expenditure being required prior to the passage of the Budget Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are several items in the appropriations in the Advance to the Minister for Finance for which no appropriations appear to have been made this year. It would appear that appropriations should have been made. At first glance it would seem that some of the requirements being sought through the Advance to the Minister for Finance should never have arisen. They are indicative of very bad management and Budget planning by the departments concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>   For example, although the amount is relatively small, there is an application for funds to the Advance to the Minister for Finance of $5,387 from the Department of Administrative Services for royal commissions and inquiries. No appropriation has been given despite the fact that there was advance information that that money would be required. </PARA>
<PARA>  A similar situation arises in respect of the request for funds to refund payments made by overseas students unable to undertake or complete courses of study in Australia under the Overseas Students (Refunds) Act. Although there was money appropriated in the Budget the amount of expenditure will sufficiently exceed that amount; this again requires a use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance which should not have been required. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are other examples of similar situations. For example--I am sure my colleague Senator Michael Baume will comment on this, so I will not pursue it in detail--the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories asked for funds. Again it should have had appropriations accorded to it, but no appropriations were made. Similarly, although the Budget for 1991-92 allows for payment of up to $31.2m to wheat growers as compensation for sanctions against Iraq, there appears to be no Budget appropriation for that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I draw those matters to the attention of the Senate. We have spoken many times in the past on the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I believe that the Advance is being used improperly on frequent occasions--I have made that point many times, as have my colleagues. On this occasion I believe there is, subject to further scrutiny, quite clear evidence that many of the items being claimed for usage in the September Advance to the Minister for Finance should have been taken account of and the Government should have been aware of them before they arose. It is just another example of the absolute sloppiness and bad administration for which this Government is increasingly becoming recognised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to join my colleague Senator Short in expressing concern about what appears to be clear incompetence by the Government in this area of funding of Government activities. We are still dealing with the Budget; it has not passed yet. There is no doubt, as we have seen, that various elements of the Budget have been subject to major revision, such as health services. Senator Walters pointed out yesterday how ludicrous it is for us to try to pass appropriations while in fact the Government is still changing them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We have an example where the Government decided on 15 July 1991 to provide $800,000 in the current financial year and $100,000 in the next financial year to the Australian Electoral Commission to assist it in the costs of the 1992 ACT election. I have no knowledge of or concern about the merits of that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  All that is evident to me is that the decision was made on 15 July and the Budget was brought down on 20 August. The Budget made no provision for funding the decision made on 15 July. That decision was made more than a month before the Budget. I do not know whether the Government is doing this deliberately, whether it is trying to fudge the level of Government expenditure or trying to understate it, when it knows perfectly well that it will be spending more than it is stating in its Budget Papers. This is a clear example of that. It is a relatively small amount for the Government--$800,000 this year and $100,000 next year; almost $1m. </PARA>
<PARA>  One would think that, if the Government had a decent level of integrity, it would at least mention in the papers--at least mention somewhere--the fact that it was to have additional expenditure. Frankly, I cannot see why more than a month does not provide it with more than enough time to have included this in the Budget Papers. The explanation for the need to have this extra money while we are still debating the Budget is:</PARA>
<PARA>The Electoral Commission is currently undertaking preliminary work in respect of the election. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Australian Capital Territory election in 1992. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission has now requested reimbursement of $237,600 being costs incurred to date on preliminary work. The requirement is urgent as the AEC has requested payment by the end of August. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The requirement was unforeseen at the time that the Supply Estimates were formulated as the Government decision to provide the assistance occurred after the draft Supply Bills had been finalised. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever there was careful wording aimed at misleading this place, that is it. It was not after the Supply Bills were presented. It was five weeks before the Budget was presented to this place. I think that the Department could smarten itself up in this matter. No doubt the two Government Ministers involved could also smarten themselves up and make certain that the Department is run properly. I can assure them that after the next election it will be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report is a case study of the scrutiny by the Committee of regulations made under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This is now finally completed, exactly seven years after that Act was proclaimed to come into operation and although the process was somewhat protracted the result is entirely satisfactory. An open-ended discretion granted to the Executive to extend indefinitely Commonwealth, State and Territory laws which provided for sexual discrimination was first limited and then removed. The position now is that the Executive has no longer any power to prolong the operation of discriminatory laws, as compared to the original position where there were no limits at all on its power. The Sex Discrimination Act, following the insistence of the Committee and a full debate by parliament, now operates as it should as a stand-alone document with the few exemptions to its provisions provided in the Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA>  In scrutinising regulations made under the Act the Committee employed virtually every option open to it. These included writing to Ministers; asking for a special additional report from the Committee's legal adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan; giving a protective notice of motion of disallowance; accepting an undertaking to amend the regulations; being briefed by senior officers of the Department; and then accepting an undertaking to amend the parent Act. The report describes all these actions in detail. </PARA>
<PARA>  During its scrutiny of the regulations the Committee dealt with three Ministers--the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, MP; the Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Duffy, MP; and the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate. As usual, these Ministers were courteous and helpful, and we commend them for this commitment to the principles of the Committee. We are also grateful to the officers of the Human Rights Branch of the Attorney-General's Department who briefed the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee is very pleased to table this report as an example of the way in which it carries out its mandate from the Senate to ensure that delegated legislation does not breach parliamentary propriety or personal liberties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I speak as Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, and support the comments of Senator Giles on this report. The report is particularly notable because it deals with breaches of two of the principles of the Committee. We first considered that the regulations in question were defective because they breached the first of the Committee's four principles or terms of reference. The principle is that delegated legislation must be in accordance with the parent Act. The principle is interpreted broadly, in this case the Committee being concerned that the regulations may breach the spirit of the parent Act. This was the deficiency first raised by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  However, after some years of dealing with a succession of defective instruments, all of which appeared to breach the spirit of the parent Act, the Committee considered that the whole scheme was so fundamentally flawed that it also breached the other principle of the Committee which is designed to protect parliamentary propriety, that is, that delegated legislation must not contain matter more appropriate for inclusion in an Act of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is only rarely that the Committee invokes this principle. Nevertheless, it is an important principle going to the heart of parliamentary propriety. In this case, I am glad to say that the Minister accepted the views of the Committee and undertook to amend the parent Act so that it was not legally possible for the Executive to prolong discriminatory laws even if it should wish to do so. I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There is a second matter in relation to the LAV25. In view of the evidence that has been given to the Committee that there is quite an extensive modification program on this vehicle, is the Minister prepared to consider the timetable that seems to be driving the program? There seems to be quite a high level of haste in equipping 2 Cavalry Regiment before it moves up to its new barracks at Darwin. While it would be desirable to have those vehicles when it moves up there, it does seem that it is in no way essential for the regiment to have them. Given the complexity of the changes that will have to be made to the physical structure and characteristics of these fighting vehicles, I would have thought that there was a good case for hastening a little more slowly than apparently the Army seems to be doing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The irony of that remark is that we were accused earlier of going too slow on other matters. I think Senator MacGibbon would appreciate that. Essentially, as I understand it, there is a requirement for haste. Many of these vehicles are being produced. In Canada there is a production line. In terms of forward management, there is a gap in the production line to the end of 1994. People in other countries are very close to the same decision as us. If we do not slot into that timetable, we may well slip several years as others are put into the production run. That is one of the reasons, apart from the other factors which Senator MacGibbon has outlined, for wanting to get 2 Cavalry as mobile as possible. There is also this production line factor. There is one window of opportunity. If we miss that, it may not represent itself until Haley's comet comes back, and with increased costs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the final part of the hearing on the LAV25, we dealt with the matter of Australian production. The figure of $45m was given as a premium for Australian production, which was broadly on the grounds that there was a $10m licence fee, $20m to $25m for tooling and $15m for six prototypes. Has the Army or the Department revised that estimate since those figures were given?</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am advised that it has made no revision of those figures at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have made some inquiries and I can find no evidence that the Department has canvassed with Australian industry the feasibility of Australian production. It has been suggested to me that the figure of $10m for a licence fee is on the very high side of what would apply in normal commercial practice, and similarly with the $20m to $25m for tooling. We will need tooling to support these vehicles through the 25 years that they are in service. It would seem to me that there is very little argument for building six prototypes at a cost of $15m each, which is quite an extraordinary cost--in excess of $2m per vehicle-- because we could reasonably presume that, if we had a licence agreement, the procedures to be followed for production would lead to successful production on the first attempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I ask the Minister to get the Department to reconsider the matter of Australian production very carefully. Undeniably, there would be a premium over and above the cost from overseas, but bear in mind that there is a very extensive modification program. It is of such a scale and dimension that it would be far more economical to do the modifications on the production line than to pull completed vehicles to bits and modify them. The Minister should also bear in mind that, as evidence was given this morning to Senator Newman, we will have to spend between $40m to $50m on modifying the M113s between 1994 and 1998. The need for an armoured engineering capability within the country can be demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA>  I certainly request the Minister to ask the Department to look very carefully again at the matter of Australian production, given the fact that it has been one of the commendable features of the present administration that what can be built in Australia has been acquired from Australian sources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- I do not think we can, in general, be accused of not trying to have Australian industry involvement in  defence projects. It is not as though there is a philosophy in a counter-direction. Senator Durack asked about the costings. The $10m fee is what the company concerned would be charging as a licence fee. The project team assessed the cost for the tooling up that would be required at that level based on its visits overseas. Of course, six initial vehicles have to be hand-built. That is where the costing of the extra $45m comes from. A further difficulty, although not an impossibility, is that if we have to set it up ourselves it will push the whole project out by another three years, and that would be getting into the unacceptable delay area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The real problem with this is the number of units that will be made, and trying to get economies of scale. It is very difficult, when those start-up costs are added in, to get the same product as an imported product. As always, if there were a possibility of involving Australian industry in the major parts of the scheme, I would be very sympathetic to it. Australian industry will, of course, be involved in fit-out, so some of the money will be spent in Australia. I do not have a figure for that. Most of that will be in terms of the life cycle which, projected in current dollars, will be $600m or $680m, of which about $500m will be spent in Australia. That is based on a 25-year life cycle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On the first matter, most of the negotiations that the Commonwealth has had with ASI have tended to be put on hold whilst we wait for the State Government and ASI to complete their discussions and negotiations about the lift facility. It seems to me that the Western Australian Government is pushing a policy now that is more likely to give others access to that facility. It seems to me that that is the thrust of its negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-During the Estimates Committee hearing held on 11 September, I asked a number of questions about progress on the negotiations between Australia and the United States as to the transfer of responsibility for the administration of North West Cape. I had very full answers from the Minister and also from Dr Hawke, who gave us a little more specific information to the effect that, as at that date--11 September, if I remember rightly--officials were meeting in Washington the next day or the meeting was imminent. I understand that those negotiations proceeded very rapidly and very satisfactorily, although, quite properly, I do not have any information on the result. I wonder whether the Minister could confirm how the negotiations are going, whether they have been completed, whether they are moving in a reasonably satisfactory way and whether the agreement will be signed at the next Ausmin talks. Could the Minister please give me an update of the situation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The talks did proceed. A range of matters of great substance were agreed. There are probably still a few potholes to be filled in and a few bumps to be ironed out. But we were very happy, as was the United States, with the progress of those talks. We are now preparing an exchange of letters between Secretary Cheney and me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Durack will recall that I have referred several times to signing up at the Ausmin talks. The visit of President Bush and Secretary of State Baker to Australia--Secretary Cheney is not coming--will be a substitute for the Ausmin talks that would normally be held at about that time this year. Instead of waiting for the next Ausmin talks, at which Secretary Cheney will be available, this matter will be determined by an exchange of letters which are being prepared at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hope that we will be able to sign that exchange of letters by late November. I then hope to make a statement, perhaps in the Parliament--it is up to the business committee of Cabinet as to whether it will be made in Parliament--on the subject. I will ensure that at the time I make an announcement the Opposition and the Western Australian Government are briefed and that at the same time as I make a public announcement the work force at North West Cape is also briefed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased with the nature of the progress. Some of the concerns that have been voiced in the press about money and other things and the enormous impact it may have on the Defence Budget have all been resolved amicably, very much to our advantage and to the satisfaction of the United States. I think progress is good. I certainly expect to have the signed documents and public announcements wrapped up this year. </PARA>

The answer I got to a question as to what the RAAF meant by `an arm's length' approach--I do not want to go into it at this stage--explained that it has had briefings with industry about commercialisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was suggesting before you came in that we proceed according to the running sheet that we have before us.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The Estimates Committee report suggests that responses to 21 questions have not been provided. Fourteen of the 21 questions have been answered and  the responses were provided to the Committee before 8 October but were not acknowledged in the report. Of the remaining seven, I acknowledge that one response is overdue. That concerns a question placed on notice by Senator Michael Baume. The question was not provided to the Department. In fact, it was not until the report was received yesterday that the Department realised that Senator Michael Baume had placed a question on notice at all. To add insult to injury, the Committee Secretary could not yesterday locate Senator Baume's question. I offer my apologies to Senator Baume for not being in a position to provide an answer. I am pleased to say that a response will be available very soon. Given that yesterday we could not even locate the question, it has not been possible to answer it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I also note that Senator Patterson's request yesterday that the Department provide responses to her list of unanswered questions was not provided to the Department until this morning. That makes it a bit difficult for answers to be provided for this debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of the remaining six questions identified by the report as overdue, the Department was not aware that answers were required. A close reading of the Hansard reveals that in three cases there is considerable ambiguity as to whether a question was taken on notice. On the Department's reading of Hansard there was no question in those cases and, in the other three, Hansard records suggest that an answer was not required. The difference in interpretation in regard to these six was not brought to anyone's attention. This is despite the fact that the Department provided a detailed index of the questions it considered to have been taken on notice. This includes references to the relevant pages of Hansard. That list, which was provided to the Committee, was never challenged. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am disappointed that no consultation took place with the Department on this question of what was left outstanding. It does a disservice to the Department because no-one was attempting to avoid the answering of questions and, in fact, a detailed job has been done to ensure that all of them had been answered. It also does a disservice to the Committee of the Whole, which cannot now consider the full range of information sought by Estimates Committee members. If there were problems with the interpretation of these questions, or if some of them appeared to have been missed, I would have thought the Committee Secretary would be able to contact the Department to tell us. That is certainly what has happened in other years but it did not happen this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  I emphasise that the Department missed one question out of more than 200, and that question was not provided to the Department until this morning. Most of those questions were placed on notice and the majority were answered before the end of the hearings on 11 September. We should at least acknowledge that. I do apologise that we have had a mix-up on the other questions, and I hope it can be avoided in future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was not going to raise this issue but I find what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has just said extraordinary. We raised some of those questions because, for example, it was only this morning that this graph, which was promised to me in the Estimates hearings, arrived. The reason we put those questions down so late was that we have been receiving answers in dribs and drabs, even as late as this morning. The Minister and his Department should not be offended and hurt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I raised those issues in writing rather than raising them here in the chamber. I find it fairly unsatisfactory that, after we wrote a letter to the Minister, he should get up and say what he has said, but that is beside the point. Maybe the Minister has had a long fortnight. I can understand that he is feeling a bit touchy. Am I am right in saying that they were my six questions and that three of them did not appear to be questions?  Is that what the Minister was saying?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am sorry if the Minister is so sensitive. I thought we could have dealt with that without having to bring it into the chamber. I did not need to have that, given that the answers have been arriving in the way they have. Anyway, that is beside the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I reserve the right to examine further any areas of questioning in which the Minister or the Department undertook during the Estimates hearings to provide me with answers. As I have just mentioned, one of these areas related to this graph, which shows the Department's performance in processing unemployment related benefit claims during the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister may recall that I asked what proportion of unemployment benefit claims were processed within the requisite processing time. The answer I was given was that 73 per cent of claims met the stretching standard. Twenty-seven per cent of claims not reaching the stretching standard is a very substantial number of unemployed people, despite the fact that the Department explained to me that the stretching standard was a target which was a challenge for the Department to meet. There are now more than 718,000 unemployed Australians who are receiving either the Job Search allowance or the Newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister will recall that in the Estimates hearings, the Secretary held up this graph which reportedly mapped the Department's performance in meeting this stretching standard. As I said earlier, I got the graph, which was one of the things I had asked for, this morning. That was not a very difficult task for the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am interested in this subject because around my electorate office in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, within the Federal seats of Holt and Hotham, there has been the greatest escalation in the number of unemployed people of any region in Australia. This increase is so large that the Department of Social Security has had to open a new office at Fountain Gate to cope with an increase in the number of unemployed people in the Dandenong area from 4,100 12 months ago to 9,500 last month. In the Estimates hearings, the Minister admitted that in some places and at some times `there will be extraordinary pressures which means that even our not so stretched standard would be very difficult to meet'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was wondering whether the Minister could provide me with some localised figures for the Department's performance over the last 12 months in reaching its so-called stretching standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would be appropriate if I could have the figures for all DSS regional offices, although I am personally most interested in the regional offices in my vicinity, which are Oakleigh, Dandenong, Knox, Frankston, Springvale, Caulfield and Cheltenham. I would also like a written explanation of the meaning of the term `stretching standard' because I have gone back through the Hansard and although it is, in general terms, reasonably clear, I would like a written explanation of what is really meant by a stretching standard and how it is applied in the relation to Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance. </PARA>

That was what I was trying to get at in the statement that I made at the start. That graph that she has mentioned is the perfect example. It was given at the hearings and if she has only received it this morning, then I do not blame her for being annoyed. However, she should consider where she should direct her anger.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will follow that through and find out for myself, too, Minister. When the departmental officers are assessing the Department's performance by studying graphs, such as the one on the stretching standards, one of their primary motivations must be to ascertain the increased number of staff that will be needed to cope with the increased demands on the Department of Social Security which result from an official unemployment rate of 10.2 per cent. Obviously, the effects of such a severe recession as this one--the one that the Minister's friend Mr Keating said we had to have--reverberate through the social security system and are felt not only in the unemployment subprogram.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We have seen a large increase in the number of young homeless people over the last year. There are tens and probably hundreds of thousands of the quarter of a million people on sole parents benefit who would like to work, at least part time. Equally, there are large numbers of people with disabilities who are finding that the additional barriers which they are facing because of this recession are really testing their resolve. As we know, tertiary education is bursting at the seams. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has told young Australians that they should stay at school. Maybe one of the reasons for suggesting this is that there is nothing of any substance waiting for them in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the explanatory notes for this subprogram, there is a very interesting table entitled `Maximum weekly payments to recipients of unemployment payments as a percentage of AWE : 1984 to 1991'. It is a fairly telling table. It informs us that the rate of unemployment payments as a percentage of unemployed persons has dropped from 91 per cent in 1984 to 82 per cent in 1988 to 75 per cent as at 30 June 1991. I do not presume that the percentage has changed much since June and it indicates that the number of unemployed people alone is virtually one million. This figure does not take into account any of the categories of people seeking work to whom I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask: what estimates of the total number of Australians who want work, both full time and part time, does the Minister's Department use or have for the purposes of its forward planning? Does the Minister know how many people rely on unemployment related benefits to some extent for their financial welfare? Does the Minister know how many spouses and how many dependent children can be added to the 718,000 on Jobsearch allowance and Newstart allowance or, in the old terms, those on unemployment benefits? How many others are dependent on those people as well?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I can get Senator Patterson a figure for the dependants of those who are on benefits and I will endeavour to do that. In answer to some of the other points that Senator Patterson has made, it should be noted that estimates for unemployment are prepared by Treasury. We work on those estimates, even if we do not agree with them. There have been times during the past few years when we have disagreed. But as I understand it, we are not even consulted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am trying to get rid of some of it, but not in the direction of Treasury! I think it has to be acknowledged that we just work on Treasury's estimates. That is the first point that I wanted to make. Obviously, when we look at the number of unemployed persons and then at the number who are receiving unemployment payments or benefits as a percentage of them, we have to take into account what the ABS figures say. The difficulty there, of course, is that the ABS definitions for unemployed persons vary from the definitions that are applied by the Department of Social Security. There are, in fact, six or seven major differences which are highlighted each month inside the front cover of the ABS publication. If Senator Patterson has a look at those, she will see the reasons why there is a difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  On Senator Patterson's other point about employees, I point out that there is a staffing formula which applies so that as unemployment rises, so too does the number of people employed by my Department. That formula means that if there is an estimate of 10.5 per cent to be reached, then there are figures which we follow to see how many extra staff we have put on. During the course of this year, there has already been and will continue to be an increase in the number of staff that we have. I have a chart here, `The Selected Characteristics of Unemployment Beneficiaries and Jobsearch Allowees' which includes the number of children. If I table that, it might go some way towards answering Senator Patterson's earlier question. However, it does not necessarily take into account spouses. But that is something I will have to do some more work on for her. </PARA>

Like many others, I have no doubt that the official unemployment figures do not tell the full story as to the number of Australians who are unable to find work. Apart from the political embarrassment that could cause the Federal Government, does the Minister agree that there is a need to calculate the hidden unemployment rate, for example, by undertaking research to find out how many students, sole parents, non-working spouses and people with disabilities who want to work either cannot find work or have actually given up even looking for work? Could the Minister provide me with any information that his Department possesses which relates to the number of people receiving benefits other than the Jobsearch allowance and the Newstart allowance who wish to enter the work force or estimates that his Department may have of the number of people who wish to undertake work who are on other benefits?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In undertaking forward planning tasks, the Department is obviously very interested in any changes in Government policy which could have a significant effect on the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits. One initiative in the latest Budget which many people claim would have a disastrous effect on the unemployment rate as well as business investment is the planned introduction of a superannuation levy. Yesterday Senator Brownhill received a letter from a rather large company, which I will not name, which pointed out that the superannuation levy would most probably make it non-viable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My father, who is well beyond retirement age, is maintaining the very small business that he runs mainly because of his loyalty to the staff who have worked for him for 20 or 25 years. In fact, he shouts down the telephone whenever the Government brings in legislation, as if it is my fault. He has told me of the enormous burden that the superannuation levy would place on him. He said that it would no longer be worth while continuing and that he may as well just close the factory, sell up, invest his money and enjoy the rest of his life. I am speaking of someone who has been dedicated to his staff for 20 years and who operates his factory like a family business. But he is now saying, `I think I am going to give up at this stage because I just cannot afford to try to meet more and more demands'. </PARA>
<PARA>  However much all of us might believe that superannuation is vitally important to ensure that in future the baby boomers are not dependent on a reducing working population, we want to ensure that we do not have policies in place that, in fact, jeopardise current businesses because that is a problem as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  Can the Minister inform me of what sort of economic modelling work is being undertaken by Treasury which relates to the effects of the introduction of a superannuation levy and, specifically, what conclusions, if any, have been reached in relation to the effects of the introduction of the levy on unemployment? Has it has been recognised that the levy will have an adverse effect on unemployment? What input has the Minister's Department had in this economic modelling work? Is the Department privy to the results from this economic modelling, particularly those which pertain to the effects of the levy on unemployment?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-When any submission is made to Cabinet by any department, it is circulated to other departments for their comment. Superannuation is in no special category in that respect. My Department puts in coordination comments on the Cabinet documents. The Cabinet documents do not get released here, so I am not about to read them out. Obviously we, along with all of the departments represented in the Cabinet room, are given an opportunity to comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have heard from quite a number of people the same sorts of criticisms that Senator Patterson's father has made to her. I think it is a matter of choice. It is certainly my view that Australia has no choice but to go down this path. If we do not, we will look at having to halve pensions as the number of workers paying taxes as compared with the number of pensioners halves over the next 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think Senator Patterson will find that there are very few pensioners who will tell her now that they are living on a bed of roses. If pensions were halved, I do not think life for them would be tolerable. So as far as the Government is concerned there is no choice but to go down this path. </PARA>
<PARA>  It should be noted that going down that path is not exactly unusual. I do not think too many employers in Europe would find it staggering, stunning or different to be asked to contribute superannuation payments for workers. In any event, we are yet to see what the final package on superannuation will be. There will be negotiations over the course of the next few years, and undoubtedly a part of the payment will be from the employees. Whether that is done by taking tax cuts or whatever, I do not know. That is for negotiation between the Government and the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to economic modelling by Treasury, that is a question Senator Patterson will have to direct to the Minister who represents the Treasurer in whatever Estimates committee that Department comes under. I am not responsible for it nor can I answer for it. In terms of the effects of unemployment, I think, again, that the honourable senator ought to ask the Treasury because that is the Department that makes the calculation. </PARA>

<PARA>  While I am on the topic of economic modelling, I refer to the work that the Minister's Department is undertaking in this area and, specifically, any assistance the DSS is providing to the Treasury. The Minister would recall that in Estimates hearings he admitted that he demanded that his Department review the CPI basket and update its information on pensioner expenditure patterns.

The Department of Social Security has an officer seconded to Treasury for the purpose of the exercise. I am not certain whether the person is back with us but the cost, I am told, is under $10,000.

<PARA>  I have one answer to a question that Senator Patterson asked earlier. It concerned the comparisons between the ABS and Department of Social Security data. In the document, which is released every month, the ABS classifies a person as unemployed if he or she is 15 years of age and over and was not employed during the week before the interview, has actively looked for full time or part time work and is available to start work. </PARA>
<PARA>  It also classifies a person as employed if, among other things, he or she has worked for one hour or more during the survey period. The ABS series includes unemployed persons whose spouse is working, irrespective of income, whereas JSA and Newstart recipients are subject to income and assets tests. The ABS series includes persons being paid pensions but looking for work, for example, sole parents in receipt of a sole pension looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ABS series includes persons who are serving a waiting period before the granting of a Jobsearch allowance or a Newstart payment, or whose allowances have been deferred. This information is derived from a labour force survey, which is a sample survey, whereas our statistics are a complete count of those who are receiving them. Those differences suggest to me that the ABS numbers are fairly wide anyway. It would be difficult to push it much further than that. </PARA>

I asked the Minister a question about a disabled youth who was forced to go into a nursing home and who, because of the reduction in his income through the reduction in his pension, would have no money to survive on after paying the nursing home. In his answer, the Minister said that the 16- to 17-year-old, after paying that part of the pension--which was 87.5 per cent of his reduced pension of $163.35--on going into that nursing home funded under the National Health Act, would have $4.35 left for disposable income.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have to be very clear about this because I do not want people to fear that there will be some sort of drop. From 12 November, the total pension payable is $163 per week for 16- and 17-year-olds and $174 for 18- to 20-year-olds. In comparison, all current recipients and people over the age of 21 receive $182 per week in round figures.

As things stand, people with disabilities aged 16- to 20-years who are living in institutions and are granted disability support pensions after 12 November will face residential charges of between 66.7 per cent and 87.5 per cent on the adult rate of pension, including rent assistance. </PARA>

There is a little more preface to go before I tell her what I think should happen. I will continue to do that, if I have her permission. I think the problem then becomes, given the level of reduction of something like $20 for those concerned, that we have to look at whether they will face charges at 66.7 per cent or whether they will face the higher charges which range up to 87 1/2 per cent. Obviously, if the lower percentage can be maintained the amount of disposable income left after the withdrawals will not be the $4 of which Senator Walters speaks. Like her, I do not think it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Further to that, it is my understanding that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) wants to set the client contributions in accommodation services funded by the disability service program at 66.7 per cent of actual pension and rent assistance. It would leave the 16- to 17-year-olds with a minimum disposable income of $54 rather than $42 per week, if the percentage were to apply to the full adult rate. That is something we in this portfolio support strongly. I suppose the problem then arises that if this is done there will be some loss of income to service providers. That may mean that some service people will have a reluctance to accept the younger disabled clients about whom we are speaking. So we may need to do something to protect them further. Certainly, I will be supporting the proposal that a charge of 66.7 per cent is applied to actual pensions and rent assistance requirements, rather than the full adult rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  I shall seek Mr Howe's consideration, taking whatever action is necessary, in order to maintain disposable incomes of at least $22.80 per week--as it is now--for those in residential facilities charging more than that 66.7 per cent. I will write to Mr Howe to put that officially, although I think he is aware of my views on the question. I think Senator Walters raises a legitimate problem and I think, by taking the action I have announced, we will be able to fix it. </PARA>

He said that the institutions may not want to take the young; they may indeed push their emphasis to adults. The Minister has acknowledged that this could well occur because these accommodation services and nursing homes may well be pushed for money, considering that they are going to get less for accommodation than they had been planning for. How is the Government going to overcome that and assure the young that they will have equality of access no matter what their age?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is not something that is new. We are talking about maintaining--slightly increasing, actually--the disposable income of people in this situation. After 12 November not only are they not any worse off, but they are a little better off. Obviously, expenditure patterns for those in institutional care varies dramatically from that of other people. If what I have just outlined were put in place, we would not see anyone's disposable income reduced. Far from it; it would be slightly increased. It is obviously not a princely sum. I am not being deluged with complaints about it, even now. That is not something that disabled organisations have been taking up with me over the course of the last 18 months. Having said that, we are considering the results of the costs of disability review. Early in the new year I would expect to be able to come forward with some recommendations as a result of that review. It will redress a number of the difficulties for disabled people who obviously suffer. I do not refer only to those in institutions, but to the disabled community more widely.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Although it is not covered by subprogram 2.2.1, I refer to something that was said earlier about this chart. Apparently,with the amount of paper that passes through an Estimates committee, the staff of the committee thought this chart was circulated. Perhaps it was circulated on the night. As honourable senators know, we all have piles of paper there. When I asked the question of the Committee again and said that the chart had not been received the staff recirculated it. That was the first time that my staff or I had seen it. It has not been languishing anywhere in my office. That was the first time we had seen it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will leave that matter there instead of getting churlish about it. I suggest to the Minister, for when he is in Opposition and asks questions and wants to keep track of them all, that it would be an appropriate thing at the end of the Estimates for somebody from the Department to keep track of the papers it has circulated and for the list to be incorporated in Hansard at the end of that series of questions on that evening. It is difficult when somebody says, `I will get that photostatted', disappears out of the room and the thing comes back 10 minutes or an hour later. It would be sensible for us to keep a list of papers that have been tabled and circulated in the evening. I hope we can institute that as a matter of procedure. That would save this hassle of wanting to know where papers are and where answers are. Perhaps we could solve that and it will not happen again.

Eventually, if one is selling animals and they are part of one's business, the income levels will be taken into account for FAS purposes. We will have to make sure that we know the income level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am dealing with subprogram 2.1 `Policy and Planning'. It mentions, among other things, Mawson's Hut, about which I asked questions during Estimates committee hearings. The general impression I got from Mr Moncur and, to some extent, from Mr Blunn was that there would be no money set aside for anything to do with Mawson's Hut. I think it was put to me that it was a decision of the Government and that the Antarctic Division was going to put options to the Government. Senator Aulich also asked questions about this. I think Mr Moncur was quoted as saying that the question of Mawson's Hut is something on which they had to put proposals to the Government, and there are a number of options the Government has to consider. I asked continuing questions about whether anything was being done about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I received a letter from a Ms Janet Hughes from Balmoral Street, Sandy Bay, who informed me that she had undertaken work for the Antarctic Division. She had received a $1,850 grant from the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee and a further $210 grant to examine corrosion studies in Antarctica. I know that appears to be a paltry amount. Since 1985, Ms Hughes has published papers and she was invited to present at the Helsinki meeting of the prestigious International Council of Museums a work on the preservation of Mawson's Hut. I understand that her research reports have been submitted to the Antarctic Division by the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee. So I was a little surprised when I found that, in the answers I had received during questioning on this very important matter, which I believe all Australians would be interested in, her work seemed to have been overlooked. Does the Department wish to elaborate on this particular issue?  Is the Department prepared to examine in detail the research that Ms Hughes has done?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My understanding of this matter is that the person to whom Senator Calvert referred has been hired by the Antarctic Division to test materials for repairs at Mawson's Hut rather than to actually repair Mawson's Hut. I am told that it is Mawson base. I do not think it is true to say that moneys spent on repairs to Mawson's Hut have been withheld from Senator Calvert's view; it is not quite the same thing. My understanding is that the Minister is going to approach government with a proposal on Mawson's Hut. As  Senator Calvert would be aware from his continuing interest in the Antarctic and in the issue of Mawson's Hut, I inform him that it will be quite an expensive exercise, so it will have to be the subject of a Cabinet submission. I understand that the Minister will do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>. . . there is no currently acceptable method of preserving the hut yet it appears that no-one is willing to fund this research. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that Mawson's Hut is a high priority of the Antarctic Division, and perhaps the Minister will take into account not only her concerns but also the concerns of many, many Australians about Mawson's Hut. Those Australians include Dick Smith. I know his proposal was to put a bubble over it, but I believe that may be out of the question. Given the amount of work that this young lady has done for the small amount of money outlaid, perhaps the Department could at least let her expand on her work so that, further down the track when the Government has the money available, it could actually do something with Mawson's Hut. I accept that Mr Moncur said that the ice inside the building does have the effect of preserving it. But surely there has to be deterioration in the building because of the weather systems down there, and I know that is the type of work that Ms Hughes does. Could the Department perhaps give her a little more encouragement than she seems to have been given so far?</PARA>

I am informed that it was an ASAC grant, so it is a grant from the scientific committee, not direct from the Division. The work that this person is doing at Mawson base does have direct relevance to the kind of materials that would be used in any repairs to Mawson's Hut. I think that was taken into account in the decision to give her the grant. Certainly the Department would be looking at that research in making any decision on the repairs, so the work will not have been in vain.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do seek clarification because that answer has prompted more questions. The answer I received today said that as a result of delays the vessel is expected to return to Hobart in four days. It said that the cost implications--one of the questions that I asked related to those costs--for the delay in terms of salary, et cetera, are still being assessed.

Is it true that the charter arrangement for the Aurora Australis includes a provision that the first 12 hours of charter will be at the Government's expense?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There are quite a number of differences in this charter than in other charters that we have had. For instance, in this charter the Government is responsible for lay-up costs which did not happen before and it is responsible for the cost of an ice pilot which also was not in the previous charter. I just wonder whether this is another difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the answer that the Minister gave today in regard to the lay-up period, the Department made the point that the vessel had only a caretaker crew on board and that the oceanographic winch was statically tested at the wharf under a simulated load. Given the fact that this particular winch has to carry a cable at depths of several kilometres, I find it hard to understand how the stress that would be on the winch loaded with a steel cable and other bits and pieces at depths of between five and six kilometres could be simulated when the equipment is at the wharf where the water is only 20 feet deep. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In answer to the first part of the question, I do not think it is possible to compare previous vessels to this one. Therefore, it is not possible to compare previous chartering arrangements with arrangements that have been made about this one. This boat is designed for science much more than the Ice Bird or any of the other ships that we have used. Naturally arrangements will vary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think that we have had problems with the winch three or four times. It has been a continuing problem. When Senator Calvert asked about how we could simulate the sort of stress that the winch would be under at sea in full operational circumstances, the officers to my left said, `Easily'. The simulated test involves taking the winch beyond the capacity for which it has been guaranteed. It passed the test when it was pushed beyond those capacities. We are anticipating that it will continue to work. It has actually worked for a few days, so we think it is all right. </PARA>

I suppose people can always claim that they would have done better. If this was viewed as a strictly commercial arrangement, as it should have been, all I can say, from my time in that portfolio, is that officers were particularly diligent in tying P&amp; down as a charter party, negotiations were protracted and difficult and P&amp; has not stopped complaining since.

I do not think they will, and on that basis I will let the honourable senator know. It will not take long to check but at least we ought to give them a ring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Macdonald's second question was on the residence. I am advised that we think that is the residence of Mr Peter Hitchcock, who is the new boss of the Authority. I will have that checked, but I think Senator Macdonald will find that the residence is part of the package associated with his appointment. We will do some work on that. We have to have vehicles. I assume that we have some vehicles so that we can get in and out of the forest, but we will make sure that we give Senator Macdonald a breakdown of those vehicles and their individual costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Thank you for the opportunity, Senator Macdonald. I had an appointment with Robin Loydell of the Forest Industries Movement--I am not certain of her exact title. That meeting was scheduled for 3 September, but for various reasons it had to be put off until today. I noted in reading the brief for the original meeting that the Department had suggested that it expected the sale to be completed that week. That was six weeks ago and it has still not been completed. Because we are taking this matter very seriously, quite a number of officers of the Department flew to Brisbane to talk to Mr Simms's solicitors as recently as Monday. We are very hopeful that as a result of that meeting, a sale is imminent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There have been hitches and that is why there is an extra six weeks that the Department did not expect, but we are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to get it completed. It is not usual to send this many officers to Brisbane for a meeting with solicitors. I think that is an indication of the Department's attitude--it is treating this very seriously indeed. A lot of people are interested in this and as soon as we have an indication either way, we will let Senator Macdonald know. I expect that to be very soon. I keep saying that, but I keep getting assured that it will be very soon. </PARA>

It would be done through the Minister's office and I am not sure how publicity shy Mrs Kelly is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Following on from that, I go to the next part of any question in relation to Ravenshoe. It is the only question that I have which yet remains unanswered. By way of background, for some time I have been trying to put to the Minister, through Senator Richardson--who I might add has been helpful in at least not saying no outright--a special case for a one-off ex gratia payment to those people who lent money to the mill in the expectation that because the Commonwealth was giving it so much money, there was some Commonwealth supervision and the company was operating quite profitably and successfully in a financial way. They, like the Commonwealth, have now found out to their detriment that the company was not being operated properly in a financial way. I have tried to put to the Minister the case for a special ex-gratia payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Senator Richardson has been kind enough not to say no. He continues to say that he will put it to Mrs Kelly again, even though she had made a decision in the past. Senator Richardson indicated at the Estimates Committee meeting that he would `be happy to raise it with her again having done so in the past and particularly in the light of the events that have occurred since we asked the questions last time'. He undertook to do that. I note that he has referred that to Mrs Kelly, but I wonder whether there has been any response to date that he can give. If there is to be a response, I would be more than happy if Mrs Kelly would announce that at the same time as she announces the sale of the mill. It would be marvellous publicity for someone as camera shy as Mrs Kelly and it would be great news in north Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The situation is that I have raised the matter with Mrs Kelly since the Estimates Committee hearings.

It would have been helpful to me if some people in the Department had been more inclined to that view than they were, but they have not been so far. I hope this might give them an extra opportunity to rethink their position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am not sure whether Mrs Kelly has received much advice that favours the making of the payments, except advice from me. She still has the matter under consideration. In fact, as a result of the meeting with Mrs Loydell, I have asked for a meeting with the Minister to discuss this issue. I asked for that this afternoon and I imagine that I will meet with her in the next week or so and see if I can get a definite final response on that question. I will leave the timing of either announcement, however, to her. </PARA>

<PARA>  I will waste a minute and say--and some of my colleagues will not appreciate this--that the Minister's reputation in the Ravenshoe area has not been good because of history. But whenever I have anything to do with Ravenshoe I say to the people there that he has been exceedingly generous and supportive in recent times, particularly since he has been Minister. I for one do appreciate that, I think he is doing the right thing at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>  I certainly agree with the Minister that it is a case very deserving of support and hopefully his departmental advisers will take heed of what he has said. I might say to Senator Richardson that I will certainly make known his comment that he has supported it--not that Senator Richardson is incapable of making his own views known, but I will assist him in that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would say again for the benefit of the departmental advisers that I can understand the reluctance in that the Department certainly does not want to create a precedent. I can appreciate that fully. I will not go through the grounds again except to say that it is documented in speeches I and other people have made and in letters that have been received that this is an exceptional case, that it would not be used as a precedent and that it would be quite appropriate to make a one-off grant in this particular instance. The amount of money involved is very small. It ranges, depending on which figures one uses, from $250,000 to, I think, $750,000. There is still money in the structural adjustment package or the `up to' figure that might be able to be used. </PARA>
<PARA>  I just point out that the Commonwealth spends money in many other ways. Under subprogram 6.4, I think we spent $1m in the last year on consultancies. This area, which means so much to real people, is one thing that I think could well be looked at. I appreciate the Minister's support for that. </PARA>

In the area that I just mentioned there is almost $1m worth of them. I understand that the Kinhill payment is shown at only $20,000. This seems to be a different figure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to Tully-Millstream, which was discussed at the Estimates Committee. Before doing so, I refer again to the list of consultancies. I note that a group named Energy Policy and Analysis Pty Ltd was paid $2,500 and then $5,000 to review previous advice concerning the Tully-Millstream task force report and, secondly, to review the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme.

If the Department is doing it, I ask why Energy Policy and Analysis Pty Ltd had to be engaged to do this particular consultancy work. </PARA>

So I do not think there is any connection with Griffith University. It is not unusual for departments to bring in consultants when they are conducting reviews of this kind. As I understand it, the task force report touches upon some technical matters and this kind of technical expertise in power generation is not necessarily resident in the Department. Clever as the officers are, they are not omniscient and, on this occasion, they brought in an outsider who is an expert.</PARA></TALK.START>

I did, and it makes it a much more interesting and informative experience. I did not know that the Department had hired Mr Tracey. If it has, that is good; I am delighted to hear it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-When I was the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories I can recall when asked about the Tully-Millstream project, after going to Ravenshoe again to visit the offices of the electricity authority to look at the plans for the protection of endangered species--the Atherton Antechinus and another one; there were two as I remember--having a look at the proposals. It is fashionable for environment groups and environment Ministers to be critical of, in particular, power generating authorities in the way they do business. I was quite impressed and I thought in Queensland they had really tried.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My view of it after that was that, given that the World Heritage agreement itself allows for acts of economic necessity, the dam could go ahead provided there was a demonstrated need for the power, and that meant looking at options other than a hydro-electric scheme there. That attitude has been maintained by the Commonwealth. A working group was set up by the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I could get Senator MacDonald some further information, and I will endeavour to do so. But my understanding is that the Commonwealth presented to the Queensland Government some suggestions on what the other options might be. The Queensland Government decided as a result of those suggestions that further work needed to be done on them. The Queensland Government has therefore set up its own internal processes to deal with this and to provide the Commonwealth with further responses. So at the moment the Commonwealth is awaiting some further information from Queensland before a final decision is made. </PARA>

With Senator Button's call for fast tracking of projects and not having them pigeonholed and put aside in any government department--we can only talk about the Commonwealth Government departments--if the Tully-Millstream project were to go ahead as recommended in the task force report, it would provide quite a boost to employment in the Cairns-Innisfail area and would be a good project that would encourage industry in north Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I accept what the Minister says, that the Government will get the response in November and it will go to Cabinet in February. While I understand that governments are big and the wheels have, of necessity, to move slowly, these are the sorts of things that get tied up in the red tape and the green tape, to use an expression that is getting more prominence these days. I urge the Minister to pursue Senator Button's line and not let these things remain too long in the departmental pigeonholes or anywhere else. I would not suggest it is the Commonwealth Department that is doing that. I urge the Minister to use his best endeavours to make sure that the Queensland Government supplies the information as quickly as possible so that the project, if it is to go ahead, can do so at the earliest possible time, which would have a big influence on unemployment in far north Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have been fairly careful not to make any comments on fast tracking thus far and I will not break my duck here. The list of projects that have been looked at for fast tracking, it should be noted, contained almost none that had a delay caused by environmental reasons. Most were for economic, not environmental, reasons. That does not surprise me; I knew that would be the case. One must look beyond the hype, and very often people do not do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the case of Tully-Millstream, as I have said, my attitude is on record. If it is shown that there is a need for the power and that this is the most cost effective way of satisfying that need, I will support it. But I have not seen any documentation yet, so I cannot express my view. But it is in everyone's interest, including the environmentalists, to get a decision on this as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most important to this decision is the Queensland Government which has been wanting it to be as speedy a process as possible. I know that Premier Goss and the relevant Ministers are fast tracking their own approach to this. We are actually dealing with very big questions when it comes to power generation and the various alternatives to it. That involves hundreds of millions of dollars and obviously we cannot fix it overnight; it takes a bit of time. I know that the Queensland Government is working very hard. I can guarantee that our processes will be very quick, but we rely upon the receipt of information from Queensland. It is promised by the end of November and I am pretty sure that we can stick to the timetable I have outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I crave the indulgence of the Committee and more particularly my colleagues to ask one final question. Does the Minister have a series of proposals from the Queensland Government in relation to the structural adjustment package concerning the Fraser Island and Great Sandy region? If so, are the Minister and the Department happy with the proposals for the package put forward by the Queensland Government?  Are the Department and the Minister satisfied that the package and the proposal to administer the package will avoid the problems, to put it mildly--or fiasco to put it more accurately--that have occurred in Ravenshoe? Is the Minister satisfied that the administration and the program will ensure, as far as possible, that there will be no overall loss of employment opportunities in the Maryborough, Hervey Bay, Fraser Island and Great Sandy region as a result of the package proposed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My understanding is that the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government agreed on guidelines for how money from this package for the Fraser Island and Great Sandy region might be spent. Therefore, the Queensland Government will have to work within those guidelines when deciding upon which projects will go ahead. But the Commonwealth itself will not be approving projects. They will be approved by the Queensland Government. What we have done is provide the money and agree on guidelines as to how it will be spent. I do not expect we will be given a list of projects. I think it is a matter which the honourable senator should take up with the Queensland Government if he wishes to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Certainly, Premier Goss is anxious to maintain employment in the region. That is why he has sought quite considerable Commonwealth funds for it. If he sticks within the guidelines, I am sure he will make sure that most, if not all, of the people affected will have employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I now turn to the issues regarding the Office of the Supervising Scientist. I note that some detail was provided in answer to the questions that were taken on notice about the report referred to as the Taylor report, which is a review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The review was completed by Professor Taylor on 22 November 1989 and was in fact tabled by Senator Richardson in this place on 18 December 1989. At the time of the Estimates consideration of this matter, there had been no formal response with regard to the 47 recommendations contained in that report to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As a result of the questions that I asked, a quite comprehensive document has been supplied to the Committee setting out the issues that have been addressed and the current status. But it still concerns me that, of the 47 recommendations made by Professor Taylor, some 28 have not yet been concluded or established. In fact, the common phrase used throughout the document presented to the Committee in regard to each of these 28 recommendations is, `requires consideration and response by Government'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given the very serious nature of that particular review, and many of the issues that relate not only to finance but also to the operation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, what is the timetable in which the Government proposes to actually give consideration to these recommendations that have now been outstanding for some two years? When does it intend to address the very serious issues that relate to the environment, mining, Aboriginals, the future operation and structure of the Office of the Supervising Scientist--in fact, the whole ambit of the operation of such an important office? I would have thought, given the priorities of the Government with regard to the issues of the environment and Kakadu National Park, that this issue would not have been left standing for some two years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to speak generally to the report, particularly in respect of the trust accounts mentioned in it and the section 41d unaudited profit and loss statements. This is a new matter for the Department of Administrative Services. It is something that has only been introduced in the past year or two and it has taken the Department quite some time to come up to speed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It would be easy to make some negative remarks about aspects of the trust accounts, but I do not believe that would be productive as the Opposition supports the establishment of trust accounts but recognises that they are still, to some degree, in their infancy and that there has been a fairly long learning process. It has meant the introduction of the well overdue accrual accounting system into the Government sector. We appreciate that this has meant a major change from traditional government accounting and, thus, a re-learning process, hence our patience. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was with some relief that under the system of accrual accounting balance sheets, profit and loss accounts and notes to accounts were provided for each of the separate commercial units within DAS. I believe that the Minister floated the idea of a single trust account for a time, which we believe would have totally destroyed the original purpose of going to accrual accounting. It would have meant that cross-subsidisation inefficiencies would have been hidden from the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was also some concern expressed in the early days that with the move to trust accounts, accrual accounting and the section 41d profit and loss statements, a lot of the dollars would disappear and be charged off to other departments, and would not be available for scrutiny by the Parliament. This has been subsequently covered and not only this Parliament but also future parliaments will appreciate that. It would have meant that much information on the single trust accounts would have been simply privy to the Minister and the Department head. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition also welcomed the provision of details of trust accounts to Estimates committees. I realise that some problems were associated with them because they were unaudited, but we are happy to accept that because we believe that any subsequent changes would not be of any great magnitude. It could have been claimed that the revenue to DAS was at some other department's expenditure. From a parliamentary point of view, if that had occurred, it would have been virtually impossible to track. It would have made parliamentary scrutiny impossible. </PARA>
<PARA>  As an overview it is somewhat annoying that, with the trust accounts in place, there continues to be a degree of secrecy in that, with one or two major exceptions--and I nominate Comcar as one of those--problems and potential problems do not seem to be highlighted. This means that Estimates committee members have to rely on leaks and fishing expeditions to dig out information. One cannot help but form the impression, rightly or wrongly, that some departmental officers have been put through a training course on damage control. This has certainly been the situation with most Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having gone down the track of trust accounts and accrual accounting, it is neither appropriate nor in the interests of the Parliament or the various quasi commercial units that this attitude continues. It is an attitude which is not adopted by the responsible public companies. I believe that the Minister and departmental officers would save a lot of anguish and time at future Estimates committee hearings if this point is recognised and, as a result, more information is provided in the notes of the accounts, both good and bad. </PARA>
<PARA>  What emerged from the trust accounts was that in the process of accrual accounting--and, I might say, proper costing, on which I congratulate the Department--an amount of 19.2 per cent of salaries was charged as employer superannuation. This is also referred to in the Committee report. This amount was handed over to the Government Retirement Benefits Office in the Department of Finance. It does not include employee contributions to SFIT, but does include the 3 per cent occupational superannuation which is invested. The 16.2 per cent balance of about $38m goes into Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>  As everyone knows, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme is unfunded from an employer's point of view. It would seem that some consideration should be given to the fact that DAS commercial units, which now operate as separate enterprises--if I could call them that--and which pay the equivalent of employer funding of super, would have been a good place to start for full funding. Maybe it is something that a future government will take into account when we have a surplus on our domestic account. </PARA>
<PARA>  I noted one disconcerting feature throughout the quasi commercial units or trusts. When asked on what basis charges were made, the response inevitably was market rates. One of the features of competition, particularly in the service industries, is that there really is no such thing as a market rate. The impression I formed was that, rather than start with a series of costs and then determine what the rate should be, what these units have done--and I presume there is good reason for it--is start at what they perceive to be a market rate and then work backwards. This response raises the spectre of bidding for business and, if a loss is made, going back to the taxpayer to recover the loss. There is, therefore, not the same cost consciousness which applies in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make those remarks not in any way to be critical but simply as observations as a result of what is really the first full year of proper trust accounts with proper accrual accounting. I believe that it is in the best interests of the Department, the units and the future that those comments be taken on board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I return to subprogram 1.1. In the Estimates we raised the issue of the sale of staff housing. I have received a very comprehensive reply from the Department of Administrative Services which went into a lot of detail with regard to the 123 properties that are currently subject to sale by the Department. I note from the answer that the Department has advised that of the 123 properties, six have been sold on the open market; four have been sold in the Service to other departments; 14 have been sold to tenants who have already settled; 74 are still with tenants who are in the process of purchasing; and 25 have been nominated as rental properties in the stock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I also notice that attached to the answer provided by the Department was a detailed agreement between the Department and the Trades and Labour Council of the Northern Territory dated 26 June 1991. The document established under the heads of agreement that the sale price for the properties was to be set at a market value dated September 1990, as assessed by the Australian Valuation Office, and adjusted to take into account the improvements made by the tenant. Tenants had the right to query this valuation and to seek an independent valuation. I note that nobody has taken up that offer. Quite frankly, I am not surprised because, with the 14 properties where the settlements have taken place, the valuation that was struck as at the date of settlement--which would have been subsequent to September 1990--attracts various discounts, et cetera, that apply under the agreement as well. But the actual valuation that is applied is in effect predated 12 months before the date of sale. The valuation on the 74 properties currently on offer--and they are all listed--is now nearly 15 months old. </PARA>
<PARA>  From information that I have seen relating to similar sales within the Australian Broadcasting Corporation of properties formerly built by the Federal Government, I note that wide discrepancies exist between the valuation price established as at September 1990 and the date of sale which, of course, in the 74 instances is still to be determined. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation property was valued at, I think, $110,000. Under the discount arrangements, it was sold for $90,000-odd in March this year. It was sold on the open market some three months later, in June or July of this year, for $155,000. So there is a very wide discrepancy. </PARA>
<PARA>   Comparing the 14 settled properties sold to tenants, which were all sold at figures under the September 1990 valuation, with the six properties sold on the open market, it is interesting to note that every single one of the six properties was sold for a substantially higher figure than the valued figure. For example, a property at Woodroofe, which is in the satellite city of Palmerston, was valued at $80,000 and had a sale price of $83,750. In Rapid Creek, a property valued at $96,500 had a sale price of $121,000. In Alawa, a property valued at $76,000 had a sale price of $81,000. A property in the inner area of Darwin had a valuation of $175,000 and a sale price of $200,000. In Millner, a property valued at $82,400 had a sale price of $85,000. In Anula, a property had a valuation of $75,000 and a sale price of $96,000 on the market. So obviously the sale prices being realised are at least 25 per cent higher on average than the valuations being used for the sale of these properties. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 14 properties that have been settled in the period, of course, have all been sold below valuation. The 74 properties that the Department currently has on offer are all being offered at figures that are below the September 1990 valuation. Therefore, in looking at the valuations involved, the Government is discounting very considerably and there will be a very considerable loss to Consolidated Revenue on those particular properties. In the answers that were provided by other agencies--I think by Telecom, Australia Post, the Civil Aviation Authority and others of that nature--several adopted this backdating of valuation type policy, although I believe the Civil Aviation Authority indicated that it was selling at current market value. </PARA>
<PARA>  It concerns me that in the Northern Territory this is creating an inequity. Public housing, which is in effect financed by government--either Commonwealth or State--and being sold through the Northern Territory Housing Commission, is only available for purchase by tenants at the valuation at the date of application. This particular agreement that has been struck between the Department and the Trades and Labour Council in effect cements a special backdated deal which can only be at cost to the Department and at considerable cost to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister might well argue that in moving the stock out of the Government holding it is no longer a cost as a tenanted building that requires ongoing maintenance and, of course, other general costs. That is a matter that I appreciate the Government has quite properly had to address. Of course, there are discounts in the formula where tenants have made their own improvements, and I accept that they are quite proper and reasonable. I am concerned at the principle that has been established for the sale of Commonwealth houses--in this instance, at least 80 sold by the Department alone and probably another 100 sold by similar agencies--which in most instances have been sold at valuations of at least $20,000 per house. If you multiply that out, it is a very considerable cost to government. The principles that have been adopted need very careful consideration because, in effect, it is the sale of Commonwealth asset by special deal between the Government and the unions. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am keen to establish that the Government is reviewing this valuation process. No State or Territory government would be allowed to adopt this process under the Commonwealth-State housing agreements for the sale of Housing Commission stocks throughout Australia. Special deals have been struck and very special advantages have been given in these instances; it has been dissipated through a number of particular agencies. In the ABC, we saw this 50 per cent capital gain in the space of three months on a particular housing stock. Similarly, I note that in this agreement there is no restriction on resale for any of these houses within a specified time. I am keen to establish what involvement the Minister or his predecessor may have had in the determination of the agreements that have been struck between the Department and the Northern Territory Trades and Labour Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was involved in these discussions, and that is pretty widely known. Senator Tambling takes one view of the matter which he maintains in this place. At the outset, let me make it quite clear that, when I was discussing this matter on a number of occasions with the people in the Territory, they all put to me the view that Senator Tambling was very supportive of an arrangement such as this. I made mention of that in the Estimates Committee process on 5 September. That point should be put on the record at this stage. I am sure that Senator Tambling's constituents will be interested to hear of his change of heart in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The fact of the matter is that the benefits are not all one way. That should be recognised when approaching this issue. At the outset the valuation arrived at by the Australian Valuation Office on the houses in question should be defended. Those valuations have been used as the benchmark. The process for sale commenced about 12 months ago. The discussions commenced at that time. That is the main reason why the September start-off date was chosen. Let me say that one should not question the legitimacy of the valuations. I think Senator Tambling understands full well that in Darwin in particular there has been an increase in house prices in excess of national trends and contrary to those trends. The date was chosen as the appropriate date because it had a relationship with the start of negotiations with the Trades and Labor Council.</PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Tambling makes a rather wild assertion that there is a discrepancy between the potential sale price and the actual valuation of about $20,000 per house that was sold. In the figures that Senator Tambling read out, the discrepancies are as low as $2,601 in one instance and $3,700 in another. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Senator Tambling did say that. If he goes back to read the Hansard, he will find out what he said. There are advantages for the Government in disposing of these houses. Senator Tambling quickly and fleetingly recognises that. In this case the advantages accrue in a number of different ways. First of all, there is the cost to government for maintenance, upkeep, renovations and whatever. Those sorts of costs will no longer be incurred by government in respect to the houses that have been sold. The process, the discussions and the arrangements that were entered into with the body representing the government employees in the Territory also recognised that in some cases people had been living in these houses for quite some time but not as long as others. There is recognition that people had made improvements to the residences, and that was taken into account when coming to the final formula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Another aspect that should be taken into account is that benefits accrue to the Government in a block deal such as this because there is no need to pay for advertisements, commissions and whatever. We are talking about an outcome which takes a burden off the taxpayer. It gives people recognition for the fact that they have lived in these houses and at the same time it means that, in the process, cost advantages accrue to the Government in the disposal of the assets. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is one other point that needs to be made, Mr Temporary Chairman. I know that this is an issue that goes very much to your concern for employees' rights. In the private sector there is quite a host of mechanisms whereby employees, particularly in locations as far spread as the Territory and other country areas, have some sort of adjustment made or process or formula arrived at to take into account the considerations that have been taken into account in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Senator Tambling rightly says, the Department has been forthcoming in providing information. It has done this, and I am pleased that it has done it because I think this is a process or arrangement which gives benefits to all sides. It is one which I have no trouble defending. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to make one point to refute a comment made by the Minister, that is, that I have had a change of heart. I certainly was consulted by various unionists and other people connected with the implementation of this scheme in 1990. I quite readily accept some of the points that were put to me in 1990, such as the discounting for the improvements made by particular tenants. I would never have agreed to backdating a valuation to the date of application and I would never have agreed to the adoption of a valuation that was inconsistent with the rules that the Government itself demands of State and Territory agencies under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is well worth noting that the agreement entitled `NT TLC DAS Heads of Agreement' dated 26 June 1991 was, in fact, signed by Mark Crossan, Secretary, on behalf of the Northern Territory Trades and Labor Council on 31 July 1991 and by Cathy Moore, Regional Coordinator, NT, on behalf of the Department of Administrative Services on 31 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, the information that was canvassed with me, quite appropriately as a senator for the Northern Territory--and I hope that it was also canvassed with Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon--in 1990 when the scheme was being addressed and looked at was very appropriate at the time. I do not believe that there has been any change of heart on my side. I am very concerned at the issue that relates to the backdating of valuations but not the other points that can be adopted quite rightly within the principle. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask the Minister very specifically whether the Australian National Audit Office has been consulted with regard to the principles that have been adopted, particularly with regard to this backdating of the valuation of a property owned by the Department. I would also ask the Minister, as a very important point of government principle, whether the Department has had discussions with the Australian Taxation Office to establish whether fringe benefits tax is applicable and appropriate on the advantage that has been gained and given by the Department under these concessions. I further ask what consultations the Department engaged in with the Tax Office to ensure that the Department of Administrative Services is properly measuring up in giving such a concession, as any commercial business operator would be required to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that they are very important principles that need to be determined in this area. I would also seek to ascertain what discussions have taken place with the Northern Territory Trades and Labor Council and the other government agencies and statutory authorities that have engaged in similar home sales programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On the last point, if Senator Tambling goes to the Estimates Committee Hansard he will find that that point was in fact canvassed. Mr Ferrari said then:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is a responsibility of each of those departments to handle acquisition and disposal of its properties as it sees fit. </PARA>
<PARA>At the outset I should thank Senator Tambling because he did twig my memory in respect of one particular point which I am culpable for not raising. That is to place on record the role that the two Labor members in the Territory played in pursuing the interests and rights of their constituents. Warren Snowdon was quite assiduous in pursuing the rights of the employees involved in this area and that of the union movement, as was Senator Bob Collins, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support. I am sure that the people of Darwin appreciate the positive work these members of parliament have put into ensuring this particular outcome. From memory, I recollect the Northern Territory News at one stage coming out and being very supportive of this particular arrangement and the work that Bob Collins had put into achieving it. From the Representatives side of politics, Warren Snowdon should also be recognised for his important role in achieving this outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Tambling makes one point consistently; that is, he refers to backdating. There is no backdating here. We are talking about a date which was, as I say, related to the start of the process. That was the date which applied. He mentioned the Australian Taxation Office, but when one takes into account the fact that we are talking about a valuation at that particular time and the fact that in a block sale benefits accrue to both the individuals involved and the Government, I do not see that his concerns in respect of tax are legitimate ones. But I will seek more information on that point. My response also relates to Senator Tambling's inquiry about audit. Once again, I will come back to him if there is anything to add to my response. But I do not think auditing has been involved, nor do I see a role for it, given the propriety of the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It concerns me that the Minister is seeking to apply creative accounting principles with regard to the establishment of a valuation of a particular property on a date of settlement, which I believe can be quite properly established by the Taxation Office in any of these matters. I note from the schedule of properties that, of the 123 properties in question, there have been six sold on the open market in which the sale prices--on whatever dates the settlements were--were considerably higher than the previously ascertained 1 September 1990 valuations. The four properties which were sold departmentally and internally were settled for that valuation figure exactly--no discounts for any improvements, changes or anything else were given. The 14 properties where tenants have settled at various dates in 1991 were all at the previous valuations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  So the date of settlement is quite easily put out. There is a sale price which the Department negotiated. I would have thought that, if there was any concessional advantage given in that area, the Department, quite properly at that date of settlement, ought to have declared it to the Taxation Office and sought to ascertain what that additional advantage was. Then, like any commercial operation elsewhere in Australia, it would have paid the appropriate fringe benefits tax. That obviously has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA>  From the Minister's answer, I now note that under the terms of the agreement the other 74 properties, which are in the process of still being determined and settled, all have an established sale price. That will, of course, be to the advantage of the 74 departmental tenants who are picking that up. But what is worrying me is the important point of principle that the Department, in its own way, is now determined to adopt; that is, this principle of a 15-month-old valuation on each of these properties. </PARA>
<PARA>  I imagine that, if the Australian Taxation Office were applying the same principles as it would to any commercial business or to any private person dealing in real estate who gave this sort of advantage, penalties, taxes and other appropriate areas would be brought into being. I trust that this issue will receive attention. The Minister did not actually acknowledge whether the Department had sought advice, as any normal commercial operator would do, from the Australian Taxation Office in this particular regard. Similarly, I did not gain from the Minister any acknowledgment that advice had been sought, as is normal, between the Department and the Auditor-General's office. I would be keen to know of any discussions with regard to these issues that have taken place. </PARA>

One of the opportunities listed for cost minimisation is a reduction of the work force size consistent with workload by Government funded retirements, and it says in brackets that the business is significantly over-resourced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There is, of course, a difference in asserting that the enterprise is over-resourced and then giving precise figures as to the actual levels that are excessive at a particular day. It is understood that the operation is over-resourced. I think Senator Parer understands that, given a process such as untying and the capacity for departments to go off and contract for work which we would otherwise have done for them in a tied relationship. Downsizing is occurring mainly due to that particular process, but then to be able to come up with a particular figure on a particular day is a quantum leap.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In my remarks last night I raised the subject of the official observer mission for the inaugural direct elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council. At the expiry of my time, I was enlarging on some of the recommendations of the mission concerning the electoral process. The next issue I wish to address relates to access to the media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Currently in Hong Kong, there is a statutory prohibition on the usage of the television and radio for political endorsement or advertisement. This is perhaps pertinent to an issue currently before us in Australia. The mission regards this as a significant constraint on the candidates' ability to contact the voters in Hong Kong during the recently concluded election campaign. Given the influence of television and radio, these media could act as important campaign communication sources. The ban restricts the open expression of political opinion. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a related issue, the electronic news media in Hong Kong also tends to practise a notable degree of self-censorship in the area of political coverage. In not wanting to appear biased for or against any candidate or opinion, many news broadcasts are essentially devoid of political coverage. Print journalists also practise forms of self-censorship, but to a lesser degree. This is a phenomenon which bodes ill for the future of political discourse in Hong Kong. If organisations or individuals begin to limit their discussion of political events or opinions because of a particular group's anticipated reactions, the fundamental freedom of expression is gradually eroded. </PARA>
<PARA>  The electronic media was used by the Government for general get-out-the-vote messages and limited political education announcements. During the months immediately preceding the September 1991 Legislative Council elections, these advertisements were aired on a regular and frequent basis, although some observers have criticised the Government for lacking enthusiasm in its political education efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another issue is that of the geographical constituencies from which candidates were to be elected for the direct elections. The Governor-in-Council decided on nine two-member geographical constituencies with the two first-past-the-post candidates to be elected as opposed to a system of proportional representation. The number of eligible voters in each constituency varied dramatically with disparities of up to several hundred thousand. This led to charges of government manipulation of the elections. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the physical features of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories were used to justify the boundaries used for this election, the excessive malapportionment evident certainly stretched the credibility of this argument. One popular proposal for addressing this problem was the establishment of an independent Boundaries Commission representative of the differing political viewpoints in Hong Kong and directly responsible to the Legislative Council instead of the Executive. Such a move would protect the Government from charges of impropriety as well as lend substantial credibility to the electoral process. Even with this proposal, there is the potential for stacking the Boundaries Commission with biased commissioners. This would do little to solve the issue at hand. </PARA>
<PARA>  The matter of functional constituencies was also considered by the mission. One unique aspect of the Legislative Council electoral system is the existence of members elected from functional or profession-related constituencies. For example, members are elected to represent the teaching profession, the medical profession, trade unions, the Chamber of Commerce and the legal profession, to name just a few of the 21 functional constituencies which have been established to elect members to the Legislative Council. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the purpose of these functional constituencies is to elect a member of the Legislative Council who will particularly represent the interests of these specific occupational groups in law-making. The functional constituencies have been in existence since 1985 and the system provided for 21 functional members to be elected in 1991 on the Thursday prior to the Sunday direct election. So there were three more members of the Legislative Council elected from these functional constituencies than from directly elected geographic constituencies. This lends great importance to these positions in the scheme of Legislative Council elections. </PARA>
<PARA>  One important aspect of the functional constituency system is the method of their election. Varying from constituency to constituency, some are elected by individual members of a profession, while others are elected by corporations or organisations within a profession. In that functional elections are legally regulated only to a minimal degree, there is substantial room for manipulation. For example, a social welfare organisation representing just 25 members may get one member elected just as another organisation representing 1,200 members does. Furthermore, each constituency establishes regulations for and administers its own electoral process. This may lead to questions regarding ballot security, tabulation and campaigning. In addition, with 12 functional seats uncontested in the 1991 elections, there was concern about apathy in these constituencies, the perceived importance of the elected posts and the possibility of electoral deals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most obvious critique of the system is the principle that a voter who is qualified to vote in the functional constituency may be allowed two or three votes while others are allowed only one vote. For example, a lawyer who sits on the board of directors of a commercial firm and lives in the Hong Kong East geographical constituency may vote three times: firstly, as a member of the legal community; secondly, as a board member through the commercial sector's functional constituency, so he has two functional constituency votes; and thirdly, in the direct elections. On the other hand, a shopkeeper may vote only once. This runs directly contrary to a professed system of fair representation. As an interim measure, en route to democracy, functional constituencies may have value, but not as a permanent part of the Hong Kong parliamentary scene. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another issue on which the mission had some concerns was that of eligible voters. Currently, Hong Kong law requires seven years of residency to be eligible to vote and 10 years residency in order to run for office. The Basic Law is quite precise and restrictive in defining citizenship in Hong Kong. There could arise a problem with voters becoming disenfranchised during the transition process. In general, this is not difficult in today's Hong Kong. Voting eligibility can be lost due to death, moving out of Hong Kong or losing contact with the electoral office. The latter of these is the easiest category into which to fall. Moving within Hong Kong without active reregistration often results in loss of contact with the electoral office. There was a recent case of an entire housing estate in Hong Kong of some 30,000 voters falling off the rolls, even though only the addresses had changed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Hong Kong's voting age is 21. This is an issue because the age of majority in Britain, as well as in China, is 18. Hong Kong recently changed its age of majority to 18, with the sole exception of voting privileges. This certainly seems out of the ordinary, but the decision is said to be based upon a hesitancy to politicise this energetic, vocal and often liberal age segment of the population. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another issue is registration and voting. Handled as other administrative tasks in Hong Kong generally are, the electoral administration and the technical aspects of the registration, voting and tabulation of results appeared efficient, organised and fair. Few, if any, complaints were voiced to the mission about these aspects of the electoral system and widespread or systematic fraud was not in evidence in the elections. </PARA>
<PARA>  One critical aspect of the technical regulation of the election which bears mention is in respect of impartial observers. The Legislative Council Electoral (Procedure) Regulations does not allow for the polling site to be entered by independent observers, including journalists, not party to the election. This impacted directly on the transparency of the electoral process and the perceived credibility of the electoral procedures. Commonly accepted as an international norm, this feature was curiously absent from the Hong Kong system. As a result, the observer mission assessments had to be made on the basis of interviews with voters after they emerged from the polling booth, with party booth workers and with the occasional election day official who ventured outside the booth. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are also issues relating to the administration of the electoral process. The principal administrator of the electoral law and election process is the Constitutional Affairs Office of the Hong Kong Government. It has been suggested that this should be replaced by an independent electoral commission which would be responsible for the impartial administration of the electoral process. Like the previously mentioned Boundaries Commission, this body would be able to protect the Government from accusations of manipulation and establish a higher level of perceived credibility to the process. As the need for this type of high-profile electoral administration is still very new, the machinery and its form and function are still ill-defined and unpractised. The matter of an independent electoral commission should be looked at carefully in the review of the September Legislative Council election. </PARA>
<PARA>  The common law and the role of the courts also require consideration. The courts act as the principal dispute resolution mechanism within the electoral system. The solid respect for the law and the common law legal tradition in Hong Kong are very applicable in establishing useful guidelines in the matters discussed above. There is an election chamber in the High Court which has begun to hear cases involving the electoral law. Problems have arisen within the electoral system and have been dealt with expeditiously and fairly. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently, a judge heard the case of Emily Lau and Simon Ip, two candidates in the September 1991 election. Both had inadvertently left the name of the printer and the print date off their posters or printed leaflets, contrary to a long-standing law designed to facilitate the prosecution of libel cases. Without legislation governing campaigning per se, this law was discovered by the candidates to be applicable to their printed materials. The judge upheld the candidates with no contest from the Government or other candidates. Thus the court system worked with the current electoral code and allowed it to operate fairly. There is no guarantee of such in the future. Thus, it is widely recognised that segments of the law require legislative remedy to be more effective. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government of Hong Kong has stated its intention to conduct a thorough review of the electoral law and related regulations after the election. All aspects of the electoral process and its legal framework should be considered in this comprehensive review. The electoral ordinance and regulations, the corrupt practices law, the election administration machinery and the status of political parties should all be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Hong Kong is one of the most sophisticated and international of all cities, the development of a political framework in Hong Kong will undoubtedly be of interest to people from many parts of the world. It was beyond the scope and purpose of the observer mission to make judgments or comments about the appropriate structure for this future development; nevertheless, individually, I was obviously able to reach some conclusions in this regard. As has already been indicated, the main point at issue in the election, especially between the major parties, was Hong Kong's future relationship with the People's Republic of China and, most especially, the extent to which democracy will be established in Hong Kong before 1997 and be allowed to remain or further develop after the Chinese takeover. </PARA>
<PARA>  Undoubtedly, there is considerable continuing unease in Hong Kong about 1997. This was reflected in a public opinion poll conducted during the election campaign which showed that only 22 per cent of respondents wanted Hong Kong to return to China, with the remaining 78 per cent fairly evenly split between wanting to remain a British colony, wanting to become an independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations or wanting to become a completely independent republic. </PARA>
<PARA>  The enthusiasm and specific comments of voters I interviewed at various polling booths on election day left me in no doubt that they have a real commitment to full democracy and to its role in Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>  The voting figures showed overwhelming support for candidates supporting greater democracy before the Chinese takeover. Those who had been most vocal in these demands, the United Democrats, won 12 seats and their close allies, Meeting Point, won a further two--14 of the 18 seats up for grabs. The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood won a seat and Independents won three seats; candidates sympathetic to China polled very poorly. </PARA>
<PARA>  The election results, combined with the opinion poll result, must lead us to question the wisdom of Britain's decision to hand Hong Kong back to China. The fact that Hong Kong was part of China until the mid-nineteenth century is no valid reason for that situation to be restored for the twenty-first century and beyond. Many international boundaries have changed and not been restored over much shorter periods. However, given the agreement reached between Britain and China, plus China's general attitude on these matters, it is probably unrealistic to expect any change now. But the election result should lead democrats throughout the world to agitate for full democracy, that is, a fully directly elected Legislative Council with an executive responsible to it to be in place before the change of sovereignty in 1997. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Basic Law should be redrafted, as advocated by Martin Lee, MLC, who obtained about 70 per cent of the vote in his constituency, and others to reflect more closely the Joint Declaration. It is up to Britain to take note of the election results and negotiate these changes with China. The British Government should summon its resolve and act urgently on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given China's unsatisfactory human rights record, as documented by the recent Australian Human Rights delegation, the Australian Government should use its influence with Britain to press for these changes in Hong Kong to be initiated. The Government should also use Australia's solid relations with China to persuade it to accept such changes. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is in China's economic interests for Hong Kong to continue its important contribution as a source of investment and outlet for goods, especially for southern China. That will continue only if Hong Kong people have confidence that China will not interfere in the local administration of Hong Kong after 1997. Confidence in the future is the key to Hong Kong's continuing stability, prosperity and contribution to the mainland. Greater guarantees of democracy through changes to the Basic Law would ensure this confidence. It is therefore in China's interests to agree to this. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Government should clearly make these points to China. Changes will occur only through agreement between Britain and China, but the rest of the democratic world can bring its influence to bear on these two players to ensure a better deal is negotiated for Hong Kong and its residents up to and beyond 1997. </PARA>

I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate that speech into Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The speech read as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for the invitation to discuss with you human development issues. As members of the Development Assistance Officers Association you are the right people with whom to share these views and this is the right time (not like British Charge in Latin America). It sure takes something to get a Politician to Canberra for extra-Parliamentary duties in winter. A shared commitment to development assistance is the key. The record shows that, of all members of Parliament, I was the most outspoken critic of Budget cuts to ODA last year and the shift in priorities. So I am pleased and honoured to be among you. </PARA>
<PARA>DEVELOPMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Enabling the true human development of each individual can be seen as the main objective of society, and therefore of political and economic systems. </PARA>
<PARA>Individuals and families are the core of society. Their well being is therefore central to the political and economic processes which seek to promote development. There is no sound and authentic development of a society unless priority is given to the needs of the individuals and families within that society. To the extent that any action taken is not in the real interests of individuals and families, then it is not contributing to true human development. </PARA>
<PARA>The totalitarian ideologies of fascist and communist States sought to develop societies at the expense of the rights of individuals and families. They failed to acknowledge that the family is the natural  and fundamental group unit of society with pre-eminent rights and functions. They have been condemned by their victims and by history. Only by respecting the rights and values of the subjects of development can a solid framework for economic and social development assistance be laid. </PARA>
<PARA>ROLE OF AID</PARA>
<PARA>Australians and the citizens of other economically advanced states recognise to a greater or more often, sadly, a lesser degree their duty to assist the development of others.  This duty stems from our solidarity with the rest of humanity as well as from our self interest as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA>My own interests in this area developed really as an extension of my Union work and my recognition of the need for worker solidarity. [TTLC Rule Changes--Objects clause, ACTU, ILO, Role of Co-ops, workers rights, unemployment and under employment, poverty, Africa, PNG]. </PARA>
<PARA>In over 30 years of work in Unions and politics I have witnessed many political foul ups--some with disastrous consequences. From my observations I have concluded that these were caused not so much by a lack of good will, a lack of information, a lack of expertise, as much as by a lack of discernment.</PARA>
<PARA>The goal of discernment is to arrive, in the light of permanent principles, at an objective judgement about social reality and, according to the possibilities and opportunities offered by the circumstances, to make concrete the most appropriate choices which may eliminate injustices and favour the political, economic and cultural transformations needed in particular cases. Discernment and the evaluation of truth leads to the investigation of the real causes of social ills, and especially of injustice, and to the acceptance of certain results, not the ideologised ones, of the human sciences (see A Vous Tous). </PARA>
<PARA>So often the blind adherence to an ideological party line or to what is sometimes called the "prevailing consensus" or "prevailing view" militates against this discernment. This is exacerbated by a lack of humility which is endemic amongst many of us politicians and, dare I say, some public servants. </PARA>
<PARA>It has proved quite difficult for Governments to devise and implement programmes to assist the people of our own country despite the fact that parliamentarians and public servants do work hard to try to ensure we get these things right. </PARA>
<PARA>It is even harder though to successfully intervene in someone else's country in assisting them to help their own people work towards a more advanced stage of development. This is a daunting task. </PARA>
<PARA>It really does call for maturity and discernment particularly in respect of those programmes which work to change societal values in recipient countries, which have social engineering elements and long lasting effects. Australian taxpayers money is used to support some of these programmes in collaboration with self serving international bureaucracies. Of course "consultation" with or without implied threats takes place with elites in recipient countries many of whom have been the intellectual  victims  of the "institutional strengthening" tactics of these same bureaucracies by means of which they ensure their view prevails. </PARA>
<PARA>In seeking to successfully intervene in someone else's country Governments and their advisers must examine the effects of their own attitudes and policies on Australia and its people. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a sobering thought that as the former Treasurer said, Australia is in danger of becoming a banana republic. Our gross foreign debt is over 165 billion dollars, unemployment is rising and underemployment burgeoning. Compared with only 9 years ago there has been a 30% increase in the number of young people suiciding; statistically one in every three new marriages will end in divorce; for every three live births one unborn child is deliberately destroyed by abortion--a higher rate than UK, NZ or USA, and the perinatal death rate in the Northern Territory is over twice the national average. </PARA>
<PARA>A realistic sense of humility in the face of domestic policy failure is surely called for when policy decisions are made about overseas aid programmes and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Yes this daunting task is one which AIDAB staff initially need to face. </PARA>
<PARA>Official aid programmes operate under a number of constraints which probably make that task even more difficult than it is in theory. </PARA>
<PARA>ROLE OF PUBLIC SERVANTS IN POLICY FORMULATION</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of today's rediscovery of "ethics", I support Dr John Uhr's views that "The real heart of administrative ethics is the ethics of public accountability . . . .. accountability to the "authorised scrutineers", i.e. the elected representatives of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>Public servants carry a heavy responsibility, especially when they work on policy issues. They are accountable to the Minister, but they also carry a broader accountability to the Parliament and the Australian people. This is particularly the case where the policies have long term or irrevocable repercussions as aid programmes almost inevitably do. </PARA>
<PARA>The Public Servants are clearly not employed to pursue their own narrow interests, in a policy sense or in any other way, at the expense of the human rights and interest of the people they serve. And they, perhaps more than their counterparts who are employed by private organisations, need to discern the common good as well as the good of their particular organisation or of their boss at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>An organisation in a field where the risks are high needs to be able to admit mistakes, and to be up-front about where the risks lie, and where mistakes have been made--and I don't mean only admitting to classic foul ups like coconut factories in Tonga or land resettlements in Kenya!</PARA>
<PARA>Operating in the public domain in a number of countries as AIDAB does, there is also the requirement to provide relevant and accurate information to interested parties, including, of course, members of parliament. I must acknowledge the strenuous efforts of AIDAB staff to discharge this duty to Democracy. It would not inspire confidence to see information having to be dragged out of an organisation at Estimates or wherever when common sense as well as the rights and duties of all involved would require that it should be given freely to a Member of Parliament in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>It would become painfully obvious to observers and participants alike that an organisation which could not manage to get accurate information to interested parliamentarians in its own country would have even greater difficulty in consulting effectively with those affected by its programmes in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA>One area about which information is lacking are reports and evaluations by AIDAB on those International organisations which are supported by Australian taxpayers funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Serious questions need to be raised about their accountability and their pursuit of a party line to the exclusion of professional discernment. [Examples: WHO/UNDP/UNFPA/World Bank/HRP Programme; Abortion drug RU486--Who/why/how promoted; other human pesticides; gilding the picture e.g. "unmet demand"; fraudulent researcher Briggs--WHO/HRP adviser; role of pharmaceutical companies; IPPF tactics of "institutional strengthening" and censorship of opposing views e.g. IPPF's threatened liable action against Trombley book "the enforced withdrawal of this book reduces much needed discussion of the issues involved"--Lancet 8/4/89; instructions to researchers to ignore ill effects of "modern" contraceptives--Indonesia; pressures on countries to establish abortion practices e.g. Ireland where abortion is illegal and where the influence of "family planning" organisations has until recently been minimal yet maternal and child health is amongst the best in the world.]</PARA>
<PARA>Again the World Bank too often seems to be out of the control of its member Governments. One reads regularly of their "policy dialogue" with developing countries having the appearance of a type of international bullying. From discussions  with American congressmen I find that they have much greater access to documentation on World Bank projects and on issues than is apparently available in Canberra. This is very obvious on environmental matters, where Congress seems to have played a very significant role in focussing the interests of sections of the US populace. It is also apparent in relation to abortion funding, where figures such as Congressman Henry Hyde seek to ensure that US taxpayers money is not used in ways those taxpayers consider inimical to their interests. There is a long way to go before Australian public servants provide the sort of information that their US counterparts do to the Congress. But why should the Australian people and their elected representatives be denied such full and complete information. I suspect that the relevant documents are frequently not held by Treasury or AIDAB--let alone the priority given for the constant and detailed evaluations of Australian taxpayer supported international organisations and their programmes which public accountability demands. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIA'S HUMAN RIGHTS INTERESTS</PARA>
<PARA>One clearly enunciated principle of Australian foreign policy is that we consider the exercise of basic human rights by individuals in a society to be an essential part of that society's overall well being. In its dealings with other countries, Australia has a keen interest in promoting this commitment to human rights. The aid programme cannot be an exception to this. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not talking here about using aid as a stick with which to beat other countries around the head on human rights grounds. But there is a more modest approach to the question I am confident finds favour with the vast majority of Australia ; that our aid must not be used in ways which adversely affect the basic human rights of others.Not that there is evidence that this happens much. But there are some sorry examples--made worse by the feeble attempts to explain that any untoward consequences of this aid is somehow not the responsibility of the Australian Government; that the concept of "coercion" varies with national and cultural settings; that "respected" international organisations such as the World Bank, WHO, UNFPA, etc. support the programme. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has shown himself to be a supporter of Australia taking a high profile and a principled stand on the universality of human rights--an approach to international relations having solid backing within the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>On a number of occasions I found myself arguing with him that for a State to interfere with the conjugal relationships of a couple and to apply coercion to dissuade that couple from having children is a breach of fundamental human rights. I have reason to believe that the Minister now agrees with me. In May he stated publicly that he shares my distaste for anything in the nature of coercion associated with population programmes. This approach is in accord with the sentiment of the electorate, as well as with common sense. To argue, as I have heard, that it is not coercion to deprive the children of "offending" families access to education, or to discriminate against them in such areas as housing or income or to violate their parents' rights as workers etc is to take an ideologically driven stance that ranks basic human rights at a lower level than a Government's policy of reducing births. It seemed to me that in this area some Australian public servants have been saved by the Minister from inflicting their own views on Australia's highly regarded international stance on human rights issues. There are many among my colleagues and in the general community who will be watching for any attempt under the new Ministerial arrangements to undermine this stance. </PARA>
<PARA>A recent launch by the new Minister for Trade and Overseas Development of "Population and Development" briefing pack for Parliamentarians paid for by AIDAB raised a few eyebrows. This pack is based on one prepared by a London based population control organisation--the Marie Stopes International. Significantly Marie Stopes was a eugenicist who lobbied Parliamentarians to act to curtail "breeding" amongst the "C3" population because of its burden on the "A1" population. Coming from that stable it is not surprising that the pack uses almost exclusively material from organisations driven by the population control ideology, accepts uncritically their "research", abjectly fails to address legitimate and growing concerns over human rights violations; repeats the population controllers' ideological party line on coercion which attacks the permanent and indivisible nature of human rights and paves the way for those violations of human rights and workers' rights about which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has expressed concern, and finally is tinged with bigotry. One can only assume that the Minister had not read the pack prior to launching it. Marie Stopes advocated the sterilisation of the "feeble minded"--a theme taken up with cruel vigour by the Nazi regime. In his response at the time to population controllers and eugenecists such as Marie Stopes, G K Chesterton pilloried the bullying of bureaucracies and the terrorism of tenth rate professors. </PARA>
<PARA>Crucial to upholding the human rights of individuals and families is the understanding and the taking note of the views of the people you are looking to assist. This is, at least in theory, an important element in the approach taken to Government activity within Australia, and it should be a central part of the way that we implement our overseas aid programme. As Atticus put it to Scout:</PARA>
<PARA>  "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view--until you climb into his skin and walk around in it</PARA>
<PARA>Or, as Bishop Kenneth Crag more loftily observed:</PARA>
<PARA>  "The first task in approaching another people, another culture, another religion, is to take off your shoes for the place we are approaching is holy. Else we will find ourselves treading on people's dreams. More seriously still we may forget that God was there before our arrival. </PARA>
<PARA>This then raises questions about a lot of activity that seeks to change the views or the practices of the supposed beneficiaries of aid so that they match up more with the views of the donors. </PARA>
<PARA>This sort of cultural imperialism seems to be an occupational hazard in the aid field. It has a long history. Much of our early treatment of the aboriginal population, and much of the colonial sentiment generally, was concerned with trying to impose a set of cultural values that were in fact the values of the wealthier or more powerful party. And cultural imperialism goes on. </PARA>
<PARA>POPULATION ISSUES</PARA>
<PARA>Cultural imperialism is perhaps as its modern day height on population matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Some years ago one used to read of economic analyses purporting to demonstrate the sense of population control programmes. The costs of these programmes were the measured costs of the various inputs. Benefits were claimed to include the costs that would have had to be incurred in educating, housing, etc the children that might have been born had the population control programme not taken place. This approach was obviously skewed in that it measured what it would cost to raise the children but it did not include the benefits they would bring. What seems to have been responsible for closing down this approach is that it dawned on observers that, if there were benefits in having fewer people, then the most cost effective way of going about the exercise would be to kill them off. </PARA>
<PARA>This result is abhorrent, but it flows from the assumption that there are clear net benefits in having fewer people. </PARA>
<PARA>The question also needs to be asked : benefits to whom?  To the heavy consumer of energy etc in richer countries?  To the Government?  To the rest of the community?</PARA>
<PARA>The tunnel vision of the international population control lobby became evident at the U.S. Senate convened meeting of Parliamentarians on the Global Environment which I attended in Washington last year.  One delegate said how "shocking" it was that people continued to breed so much in Ghana. Surely it is inhuman to describe as "shocking" the increase in the number of Ghanans, Nigerians, Kenyans, Indians or of any other people and to infer that the world would be a nicer and altogether a cleaner place without them. The population controllers are proven pessimists and fail to appreciate the creative spirit with which we are endowed. Who is to say that from amongst those people included in the "shocking" increase there will not come inventors and leaders with the gifts to enable 10 billion people to live in a more environmentally friendly way than 5 billion?</PARA>
<PARA>What is shocking is the promotion of population control policies which develop an unwelcome anti-child mentality which will enable governments, even in developed countries, to pursue anti-child and anti-family policies. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact the origins of our environment problems are to be found in a disrespect for life in all its forms--especially human life. The population control mentality will entrench this destructive attitude. </PARA>
<PARA>The question needs to be asked: can a social or economic measure be analysed only in terms of its impact on those currently living?  Much environmental analysis is couched in terms of the impact of measures on future generations. This implies that there is some value in future generations, which of course there is. But much of the analysis of population issues does not recognise this. It counts the birth of a child as a drain on the economy, but the birth of a calf as a benefit--which means that it employs a type of logic that does not make sense to most of the world's population. </PARA>
<PARA>So, population control programmes are based on an analysis that is faulty. They are also aimed at overturning the values of the people who are targeted. One comes across this time and time again in reports from other countries : in much of Africa, in China, in India, in Eastern Europe, etc. and now in PNG. Programmes are developed by foreigners to alter the value systems of local populations. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the most disconcerting aspects of following the population controllers' ideological party line is that in addition to diverting funds away from primary health care it diverts attention from the real problems of poverty and their solutions. I would like to quote a brief relevant section of my speech to the abovementioned conference. </PARA>
<PARA>   "It is evident that the population control lobby is attempting to use, for its own agenda, world-wide concern for the environment. Their assertions that population growth is a crucial negative factor in economic development and their dire predictions of resource exhaustion have long since been proved wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>  Their fatal diagnosis is that people growth in developing countries is the problem and that population control is the solution. This diagnosis is deceptive, simplistic and distracts attention from the real problems and their solutions. The population control lobby cannot trust parents to make responsible decisions governing their intimate relationships and the size of their families. It says that these decisions must be heavily influenced by the population policies of politicians at the behest of outside agencies and by governments no matter how dictatorial. </PARA>
<PARA>  As parliamentarians, we must be ever wary of the attempts by non-elected bureaucratic elites to steer meetings of parliamentarians in their predetermined direction. Over many years, the population control lobby has sought to use international fora to promote a so-called `consensus' on this issue and to use it to promote their ideology of population control imperialism. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fertility of poor women in developing countries has been made the scapegoat for a range of problems from environmental damage to famine, the primary causes of which are war, political instability and man's inhumanity to man. To propose population control as the panacea is to succumb to the pessimism of our age. To point the finger of guilt at the fertility of poor women is to set the stage for policies which discriminate against the families of less developed countries and to open the way for gross violations of human rights. The present unhealthy fixation on population control is economically and socially naive and dangerous. It diverts the attention and efforts of governments in both the developed and developing world away from the real and pressing measures required. </PARA>
<PARA>  As parliamentarians, we need to shed pessimism and exude hope to work for a fair world trading and exchange system, to reduce indebtedness and unemployment, to assist with making fisheries and farming more attractive, to exchange technologies, to promote the environmentally sound and efficient use of resources, to reform inefficient or corrupt economic practices, to promote human initiatives to feed the poor; in short, to strive for an authentic socioeconomic development based on social justice and respect for human life. Faced with evidence which has destroyed the pessimistic forecast of the population control lobby, it is now using world concern for the environment to promote its viewpoint". </PARA>
<PARA>A POSITIVE APPROACH</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, as I mentioned at the outset, society and development revolve around individuals. Human rights, human development, and societal well being all relate primarily to the individuals and family and other groups that go to make up the society. Any analysis that ignores this is in trouble, and any programme of development that ignores it is doomed to failure. </PARA>
<PARA>In the high risk business of international aid, we should be supporting approaches to development that build on this important role of the individual and of primary groups such as the family. </PARA>
<PARA>We should be supporting development activities that involve a shared set of values between ourselves and the people whom we are trying to assist. </PARA>
<PARA>And we should identify opportunities for collaboration in areas where we can be sure that the interests of the individuals who are supposed to benefit coincide with the interests of good Government. AIDAB should be proud of many of its programmes in achieving all of this, for example, in the areas of training aid, humanitarian relief, agricultural research etc. and one hopes, in the provision of infrastructure, etc. The challenge for AIDAB and for Australia generally is to ensure that all elements of its development assistance programmes and priorities support true human development. This task needs to be approached by the pathway of mature discernment unblinkered by an ideological party line. </PARA>
<PARA>If there are some of you whose immediate mental reaction to my being invited here was one of surprise bordering on resentment perhaps you might care to examine whether your judgements are indeed coloured by a party line--a prevailing view which unprofessionally censors out other views. For the rest I thank you for your invitation for asking me to this luncheon and to all of you for listening to what I have had to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have spoken in this chamber for quite some time trying to bring to the notice of parliamentarians in Canberra the plight of people in rural communities. Because of the drought, many Australians face a worse plight than ever before. I believe that those people who travel from city electorates get very isolated from the reality of what happens in many of the country areas, and I do not think that they quite understand the extent of the problems. That is why this morning I moved a notice of motion in which I said that the Senate should note:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(i)  the visit to Canberra from parents from the Isolated Children Parents' Association (ICPA),</PARA>
<PARA>(ii)  that this group represents 10,000 Australian children who are disadvantaged through inadequate and inequitable funding policies of the Hawke Labor Government simply because they live in rural and remote areas of Australia,</PARA>
<PARA>(iii)  that the education of many of these children is seriously at risk because of the critical economic recession in rural parts of Australia,</PARA>
<PARA>(iv)  that many children will be forced to finish their schooling early, simply because parents have neither the resources to send them to school nor the time to teach them at home, and</PARA>
<PARA>(v)  that this will exacerbate the growing pool of rural unskilled unemployed . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I called upon the Federal Government to address the ICPA's very real concerns and introduce strategies to avoid even more serious unemployment levels in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some case studies have been given to me which I would like to go through very quickly. They tear at my heart and I hope some of those people sitting opposite, and some of those sitting on this side of the chamber also, will understand what is happening in some of the rural and remote areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  For example, Family C lives on a specialist sheep and wool property in the western division in New South Wales. The eldest child boards with his grandmother in order to attend high school. Two children are at home being taught by correspondence by the mother, who also has a small child. At the end of 1990 the property was auctioned and failed to attract one bid, and it would be even less likely to do so now. The banks have valued the place at $130,000 and the family owes $150,000. The family's wool cheque dropped from $100,000 last year to $70,000, and the major supply of stock water--a bore--collapsed, creating another debt of $47,000 as a new water supply had to be put in to look after the animals and the people who live there. </PARA>
<PARA>  The family has lived on a family allowance supplement since April 1991, which is $650 a month, including the family allowance. With the wool floor price abolished and stock worth nothing, no money has been drawn from the property since the end of 1990. The father goes shooting as a licensed shooter when he can. The FAS plus the AJC allowance of $250 a month buys the family's food and clothing and pays for the child's board at his grandmother's. Due to the severe drought and loss of stock, the shearing this year will make only $20,000. The mother also makes straw hats when she can to make extra money. There is much hardship in that example. </PARA>
<PARA>  Family D lives in far western New South Wales on a sheep and wool property and is isolated from any schooling. The property is suffering an extreme drought and since shearing in May has lost 1,500 to 2,000 sheep. The family averaged $1,200 a bale in 1988 but, with the collapse of the price of wool, this year received $365 a bale. Due to the recession the mother has moved to Broken Hill to go into the teaching profession in order to assist with finances, and the three children are with her, which means that the family has been split up, except during school holidays. Every couple of weeks the youngest child, who is four, travels 300 kilometres on a bus to go home to spend a few days with the father, to assist with the feeding of the stock during the drought and to be his secretary and answer the phone. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have another case history. This family has six children and is very isolated, living in the Peninsula region on a cattle property in difficult country. It costs something like $100 per head merely to get the stock to market. Three of the children are in the work force: two attend agricultural college and one is an apprentice. One is at school with a university career planned and one is at home studying via primary correspondence. The husband is in Western Australia working and the wife has a job in the local town. They still owe for their children's schooling--even though they have long since left school--as well as for the child who now attends boarding school. They pay the school a few hundred dollars at a time whenever they have a spare dollar, and the school is very supportive and has faith that they will pay off all the debt in due time. They have cattle agisted on their property and the owner of the cattle keeps an eye on the place for them. These case studies are just three examples of families who are in a lot of trouble and who are being separated and torn apart by the problems occurring in the rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have yet another case history. A family manages a property north of Julia Creek. The family has two daughters at boarding school. They have to drive 570 kilometres to a bus run or 670 kilometres directly to school, so they normally drive straight to the school. The school costs are as follows: school fees and incidentals, $8,000 per child, which means it costs that family $16,000; travel, $2,000 per child, which means a total of $4,000; and tax, $13,000. That makes a total of $33,000. The family receives a reimbursement of $2,500 per child GMP and LAFH, and a reimbursement for travel of $1,260. Tax and educational costs total $26,740. The money left for the family to live on is something like $5,620 a year, and the family has taken one daughter away from school. </PARA>
<PARA>  People might ask, `Why are you bringing this up in the Senate?'. The point is that if people in those remote areas are driven away from those areas and if we say, `Right-oh, we are not going to give any assistance to those people in those remote areas', vast areas of Australia will be uninhabited; we will go back to what it was like prior to white settlement. We will have neglect and decay. Our land--both the soil and the environment--will deteriorate if people do not live in those areas. We will have an horrific loss of native animals--for example, kangaroos, which have proliferated since white settlement because of the water supplies that have been established in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  This information comes from a document signed by a regional officer of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Rural Counsellors have indicated that the stress on the families is having a very traumatic effect on many marriages and their family life and the children's lives. Nervous breakdowns are being experienced, in particular the men and the counsellors have indicated the women are keeping the family unit together and bearing the brunt of these disastrous situations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated that in an area from the top end of the central west to the far west of New South Wales, between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of landowners will have to walk off their properties with nothing but a lot of heartbreaks to show for their life on the land. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a concern to me, and it should be a concern to all Australians, that this is happening. The people from the Isolated Children's Parents Association who were here today have made a representation to me and they will be making a representation to the Government tomorrow. I know that Senator Tate is a thinking and feeling person, and I hope that these people are received well. I hope that a lot of their problems are properly accommodated. I have already made the point about the money which is owed to boarding schools. One school and two hostels have already closed because the costs are up and government grants and enrolments are down. The schools were situated in New Norcia in Western Australia--your area of Australia, Mr Deputy President--and Southport in Queensland, and the hostel was Griffith hostel in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>  One should remember that the Government of this country has just signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which includes the right to education. A lot of people in those remote areas are being denied fair and equitable access to education, and that is something we should all be looking at. These people are not asking for assistance of any great magnitude; they are just asking for a fair go. This is exemplified very clearly in a document from the Isolated Children's Parents Association, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Non metropolitan people are entitled to equitable access to education and training at a personal cost comparable to that of metropolitan people. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to what happened when we had a real natural disaster--an earthquake--in Newcastle. The people there were still able to send their children to school the next day even though they might not have had a house, because there were still buses or they had other access to the schools. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say to the Senate and the Parliament of Australia that we should give the people in the bush a fair go and make sure that we give them a full and proper hearing. Let us make sure that we keep people living in those remote areas because they are the salt of the earth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 27 August 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Did R G Hartley of the Facilities and Property Division of the Department of Defence, in a question time brief of 29 May 1991, state that Exercise Termite Spray was 'subject to the requirements of the Beecroft Peninsula Land Management Plan'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Does the Beecroft Peninsula Draft Land Management Plan (BPDLMP), Annex B, state that: 'Live trees with stems greater than 20cm diameter and of breast height, are not to be destroyed or damaged. Clearing of other vegetation is to be restricted to that which is absolutely necessary'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Did Mr Arvan Pritchard, a resident of Currarong, state in a statutory declaration of 18 June 1991 that: 'On 4 May, while bicycling along a track on ... Beecroft Peninsula with a friend, Farley Roberts (qualified horticulturist) ... we came across a number of freshly cut stumps ... We continued along the track and came upon an army truck parked in an encampment. On this truck were approximately one dozen freshly felled Casuarina littoralis complete with foliage. A chainsaw was also on the truck. On 20 May 1991, I informed the two ... rangers stationed on Beecroft Peninsula ...'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Did Mr Farley Roberts, horticulturist and resident of Arcadia, state in a statutory declaration of 19 June 1991 that '... On the deck of the [Army] truck was a chainsaw along with a number of tree tops with foliage still attached. These tops were Casuarina littoralis, the same variety as had been noted back along the track.'</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Did Naval Rangers, Mr David Singh and Mr Richard Phelps, in a minute to LCDR's David Manolas and Peter Naughton of 21 May 1991, state that: '... [W]e discovered the remains of a number of tree stumps and foliage, along the northern extension of North Long Beach trail. ... As all public access has been excluded from this area for the duration of [Exercise Termite Spray], we must only assume that the Army has felled these trees.</PARA>
<PARA>  While most of the trees felled are below the 20cm diameter limit, we consider the felling of these trees was not absolutely necessary, since [they] ... were not adjacent to an area presently utilised by the Army or retarding the successful operation of the ... exercise'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) Were attempts within the Department of Defence to establish whether Army personnel cut down the trees based on the premise that they were cut down on 19 May 1991 whereas the actual date was 4 May 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) Does the evidence in (2) to (5) negate the Minister's statement to the Senate of 17 June 1991, that 'investigations by Army and Navy have yielded no direct evidence that the trees were cut down by Army'; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) Did the cutting down of the trees breach the BPDLMP; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (9) Does the BPDLMP (p.30) state that: 'The construction of new roads would need clearance through the Assistant Secretary Defence Facilities Policy and Development'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (10) Did Commodore Rob Partington, in the Environmental Certificate of Compliance for Exercise Termite Spray, of 4 April 1991, state that: 'Activities [during the exercise] will be ... centred on ... existing roads'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (11) Did Naval Rangers Singh and Phelps, in a minute to Commodore Rob Partington of 19 May 1991, state that: 'On 12 May 1991 a front end loader opened new tracks adjacent to the main access road to South Long Beach. No new tracks have been approved for this area'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (12) Did Naval Rangers Singh and Phelps, in a minute to LCDR Naughton of 9 June 1991, state that: 'Approximately 500 metres of heathland has been cleared to a width of 3 metres, including several Bivouac areas'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (13) Is it a fact that no clearance to cut these new tracks was sought from the official nominated in (9).</PARA>
<PARA>  (14) Did the cutting of new tracks breach the BPDLMP and the Environmental Certificate of Clearance; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (15) Was the advice provided to the Minister by the department on 29 May 1991 that no new tracks had been bulldozed, which was based on the fact the bulldozers were not used, an attempt to hide the fact that new tracks were cut.</PARA>
<PARA>  (16) Does the BPDLMP (p.35) state that: 'There is to be no extraction of gravel or removal of sand, soil or rock except for Defence purposes. Any Defence extraction proposal should be subject to an environmental assessment'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (17) Did Naval Rangers Singh and Phelps, in a minute to Commodore Partington of 19 May 1991, state that: 'On Saturday, 11 May 1991, Army trucks removed sand from Long Beach North and relocated it to the 'Transit area'. Removal of large quantities of sand ... may cause erosion by undercutting from wave action. All fill should be obtained from a recognised quarry site'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (18) Did Naval Rangers Singh and Phelps, in a minute to LCDR Naughton of 9 June 1991, state that: '... [N]umerous loads of beach sand had also been dumped [on the 'Old Farm Site'] to prevent vehicles from becoming bogged. Total estimate of sand removed and not returned to North Long Beach Road: 20 truckloads'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (19) Was an environmental assessment of this extraction operation carried out.</PARA>
<PARA>  (20) Was the extraction of beach sand a breach of the BPDLMP; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (21) Does the BPDLMP (p.21) state that: 'Movement through swamps when the ground is saturated should be avoided as men and vehicles are likely to get bogged'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (22) Did Naval Ranger Singh, in a minute to LCDRs Manolas and Naughton of 31 May 1991, state that: 'It is evident from the tracks ... that several heavy vehicles ... had driven some 400 metres into the wetland before the water table impeded forward progress'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (23) Was the movement of vehicles through the wetland a breach of the BPDLMP; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (24) Does the BPDLMP (Annex B) state that: 'Clearing of ... vegetation is to be restricted to that which is absolutely necessary'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (25) Did Naval Rangers Singh and Phelps, in a minute to Commodore Partington of 19 May 1991, state that: 'The site cleared and subsequently used as a camp adjacent to the Cabbage Tree Road contradicts the site selection arrangements agreed to during the pre-exercise brief. ... The initial site selected ... was located at the Cabbage Tree Beach car park. The site cleared had not previously been disturbed'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (26) In view of the initial selection of a previously cleared site, was the clearing of the camp site mentioned in (5) unnecessary; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (27) Was the clearing of the site mentioned in (5) a breach of the BPDLMP; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (28) Does the BPDLMP (pp.7,23) state that: '[E]xamples of proposals which might require reference to the A[ustralian] H[eritage] C[ommission] are ... a development on or near known aboriginal sites ...' and that: 'Applications to study or disturb any ... midden must be approved by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service ...'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (29) Did Naval Rangers Singh and Phelps, in a minute to Commodore Partington of 19 May 1991, state that: '... Army has removed a Midden/Vegetation protection fence at the southern hear of Honeymoon Bay and dug a shower/laundry complex into a midden, resulting in an unacceptable disturbance to a protected Aboriginal site'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (30) Was the Australian Heritage Commission consulted about the proposal to take the actions described in (9).</PARA>
<PARA>  (31) Was the approval of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service sought and given for the actions described in (9).</PARA>
<PARA>  (32) Were the actions described in (9) a breach of the BPDLMP; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (33) Were the actions described in (9) in violation of Commonwealth or New South Wales law protecting Aboriginal sites; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (34) Does the BPDLMP (p.31) state that: 'The transit areas should be sited on an already cleared and levelled area ...'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (35) Did Naval Rangers Singh and Phelps, in a minute to Commodore Partington of 19 May 1991, state that: 'The clearing of the 'Transit Area' has occurred without adequate provisions for sediment retention barriers'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (36) Was the siting of the transit area on previously uncleared land a breach of the BPDLMP; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (37) Does the BPDLMP (p.29) state that: 'Monitoring should be undertaken to determine if damage [to seagrass beds] is occurring. The use of defined 'lanes' to the beach should reduce the extent and severity of disturbance'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (38) Is it a fact that no monitoring of seagrass beds was done during Exercise Termite Spray; if so, was the lack of monitoring a breach of the BPDLMP; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>  (39) What impact on seagrass beds resulting from Exercise Termite Spray has been found by the CSIRO study commissioned by the Department of Defence, or by any other impact survey.</PARA>
<PARA>  (40) Did Commodore Partington, in a letter to the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff of 6 June 1991, state that: '... Mr [Arvan] Pritchard has previously corresponded with the then Member for Macarthur (Mr Hollis) in July 1983 regarding Beecroft Peninsula. The conclusion could be drawn that he is not supportive of Defence activities on Beecroft and may be an unreliable witness'.</PARA>
<PARA>  (41) Does the Minister agree that Mr Pritchard's letter in 1983 was polite and constructive in tone, and shows that he was not opposed to Defence activities on Beecroft Peninsula, and was only asking navy to review its practice of burning-off vegetation and its positioning of a dividing fence.</PARA>
<PARA>  (42) Does the Minister believe that Mr Pritchard's statutory declaration of 18 June 1991 is inaccurate or dishonest, or that Mr Pritchard is an unreliable witness; if so, why; if not, will the Minister apologise to Mr Pritchard, and take disciplinary action against Commodore Partington; if not, why not.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) No. The issue of the trees has been the subject of an extensive Army investigation. I am advised that all members of the Army unit encamped in the area near the tree stumps were individually questioned regarding any instances of tree felling, however no admission or indication of any such action was obtained. In the absence of more definitive information and looking realistically at the overall impact of the incident, I do not propose to take any further action.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) As stated in the Rangers' minute of 21 May 1991, the majority of the trees cut down were below the 20cm diameter limit. As such, they did not breach Condition 1 of Annex B to the Draft Land Management Plan. Clearly, the cutting down of trees greater than this dimension would exceed Condition 1.</PARA>
<PARA>  (9) Yes. However, I must point out that the release of the Beecroft Draft Land Management Plan in 1987 preceded the March 1990 release of the Defence policy on Environment and Heritage Protection detailed in Defence Instruction (General) ADMIN 40-1. This Instruction transferred to delegated officers, including the naval Officer In Charge, Jervis Bay, (NOIC JB) the responsibility for undertaking the assessment and approval of proposals whose impacts are not expected to be significant.</PARA>
<PARA>  Under present arrangements, therefore, the NOIC JB is initially responsible for clearance of new road construction under Paragraph 35 of Part D of Section 6 of the Beecroft Land Management Plan and is required to refer the matter on to Defence Facilities only if the potential environmental impacts may be significant.</PARA>
<PARA>  (10) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (11) Yes. However, I am advised that the statement 'No new tracks have been approved for this area' is incorrect and that this matter was the subject of examination by Navy and Army during the exercise planning and approval.</PARA>
<PARA>  (12) Yes. It should however be noted that the papers tabled in the Senate on 17 June 1991 provided advice that 150m of the 500m quoted by the Rangers was in fact pre-existing made track.</PARA>
<PARA>  (13) As has previously been indicated, the NOIC JB and not the officer quoted in Part 9 is the presently nominated delegate.</PARA>
<PARA>  (14) No. I am advised that the Certificate of Compliance was issued in the knowledge that the tracks would be opened. I should also point out that the Certificate states that the exercise activities would be centred on existing roads, not confined to them.</PARA>
<PARA>  (15) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (16) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (17) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (18) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (19) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (20) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (21) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (22) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (23) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (24) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (25) Yes. However, I am advised that the statement in the Ranger's minute is incorrect. I am advised that the area was examined and its use agreed between Army, Navy and the Rangers during pre-exercise inspection, as the Cabbage Tree Beach car park was found to be too small. I am also advised that the site used was not cleared of vegetation and had been used by Army for previous exercises.</PARA>
<PARA>  (26) This question is not relevant, as the area was not cleared.</PARA>
<PARA>  (27) This question is not relevant, as the area was not cleared.</PARA>
<PARA>  (28) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (29) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (30) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (31) No.</PARA>
<PARA>  (32) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (33) No. I am advised that relevant offences under the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 apply only in relation to areas that have been the subject of declarations under that Act. I am advised that no such declaration had been made in relation to the Honeymoon Bay midden.</PARA>
<PARA>  The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 contains provisions dealing with the protection of Aboriginal relics and places. I am advised that, even if this Act applies to Defence personnel acting in the course of their duties, there is no evidence that the activity referred to in (29) was done in contravention of offence provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>  (34) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (35) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (36) No. The 'Transit Area' is not an uncleared area. The paragraph partially quoted in Part (34) of the honourable senator's question actually says 'The transit area should be sited on an already cleared and levelled area (eg old gravel pits)'. The Transit Area used was in fact the old gravel pit area referred to.</PARA>
<PARA>  The clearing referred in Part (35) was simply the removal of windrows of long-dead tree trunks, placed on the area to mitigate soil erosion. Some initial soil erosion and sediment retention works have already been undertaken and more extensive works, to be undertaken by the NSW Soil Conservation Service under contract, will commence shortly.</PARA>
<PARA>  (37) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (38) No. I am advised that Beach Leads were constructed to guide watercraft and amphibious vehicles along defined lanes, in accordance with the Land Management Plan. Checks were conducted daily on the amount of seagrass washed up on the beach and the amount was found to be minimal. Army divers also dived extensively off Bindijine Beach.</PARA>
<PARA>  (39) I am advised that the CSIRO has identified apparent seagrass damage over an estimated total area of approximately 2,900 square metres. The area of damage represents about 0.04% of the estimated total seagrass on Jervis Bay.</PARA>
<PARA>  (40) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (41) I agree that Mr Pritchard's letter of 22 July 1983 was polite, if firm, in tone and that it dealt with burning-off practices and fence location. However, he offers no opinion on his support or opposition to Defence activities on Beecroft.</PARA>
<PARA>  (42) I have no reason to believe that Mr Pritchard's statutory declaration of 18 June 1991 is dishonest. The incident of the alleged felling of trees by Army has been the subject of investigation by Army and Navy. Mr Pritchard has been consulted in the course of these investigations.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the circumstances, I do not propose to take any further action.</PARA>
