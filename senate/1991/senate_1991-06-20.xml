<TITLE>Telecom: 0055 Services</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Telecom is selling 0055 telephone networks to private contractors who provide offensive and sexually explicit recorded messages to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The providers of these services are advertising in the pages of Australian newspapers in a manner which is designed to titillate and attract calls from the whole community and thus play on the curiosity of children.</PARA>
<PARA>3. These services degrade and humiliate women and portray them as sex objects, and they destroy the innocence of children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, immediately call on Telecom to so regulate the conditions under which these services are made available, that women are no longer portrayed as sex objects, degraded or humiliated and that the innocence of children is protected.</PARA>

<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, bring to the attention of the Senate the case of Dr Stepan Khmara, a people's deputy in the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR, who has been illegally imprisoned since November 1990. It is our belief that Dr Khmara, who proposes an independent and democratic Ukraine, is a victim of a politically motivated crackdown on the part of conservative Communist authorities in the USSR. His arrest and imprisonment constitute a flagrant violation of the civil liberties guaranteed by several human rights covenants to which the USSR is a signatory.</PARA>
<PARA> We humbly pray that in accordance with Australia's stated commitment to universal human rights principles:</PARA>
<PARA> a) the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue to closely monitor and make strong representations on behalf of Dr Stepan Khmara case;</PARA>
<PARA> b) all Senators make individual representations to the Soviet ambassador to Australia condemning the renewed use of arrests of political opponents on the part of hardline Communist authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> c) all Senators demand from the Soviet Ambassador to Australia the immediate release of Dr Stepan Khmara as a gesture of good will and commitment to democratic reform in the USSR.</PARA>

<PARA>6/5/91</PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and the Senate assembled in Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing as a student of Sydney University to call on the Senate to reform the current AUSTUDY scheme. Currently, students are suffering under the inequitable and anomalous criteria under which AUSTUDY may be received.</PARA>
<PARA>The independent status definition conflicts with most generally accepted legal and social definitions of independence at age 18. The arbitrary nature of the current definition also fails to take account of the applicant's individual financial circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The Personal Income Test of $4000 is a strong disincentive for students seeking employment during long vacation and wishing to supplement their income during the academic year when study permits. It places a major restriction on the overall level of income available to AUSTUDY recipients and ensures that a large number of students live well below the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA>These are just two of the regulations needing drastic change. I support the Democrats' proposal of disallowing the most unfair AUSTUDY regulations, and call on the Senate to replace these regulations with ones which ensure AUSTUDY is received by those who are in need, a need which is not currently being met by anyone's standards.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is intended to equip each House of Parliament to exercise more effectively its rights of control and supervision of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>With the proliferation of executive activity in the area of delegated legislation, legislative activity which binds the lives of all Australians in so many ways is becoming increasingly complex and having the potential for avoiding ready parliamentary scrutiny. In addition, the form in which delegated legislation is presented to the Parliament is often such that the Parliament must exercise only a take it or leave it choice. The measures in this Bill will overcome these problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has closely monitored the development of delegated legislation. The Committee is an acknowledged authority on the principles of delegated legislation. It is respected by all sides of this Chamber for its work relating to specific regulations and to principles of delegated legislation. In its reports, it has consistently reported on the need for the reform of certain aspects of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In its March 1982 report, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Committee, it referred to the advantages of having delegated legislation examined in draft form before it is made. The Committee observed in that report that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) favoured the notion of issuing delegated legislation in draft. The Committee reported further on its discussions with the Attorney-General as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has frequently adopted on an ad hoc basis the practice of exposing new regulatory legislation to obtain public comment prior to enactment by Parliament . . . he concluded that, in principle, there are no reasons why a similar approach could not be pursued in relation to delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The important proviso which the Attorney-General made was that, naturally, procedures would be required to enable urgent measures to be dealt with. The Attorney-General concluded his comments on the matter by requesting that the Committee forward any suggestions which it might have in relation to the matter. The Committee went on to recommend that delegated legislation in draft form be made available for consideration and comment prior to its being made. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before the Senate will so provide. </PARA>
<PARA>I come now to the important principle of partial disallowance of delegated legislation. This matter has been considered at length and has often been reported on by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. In its Seventy-third Report of December 1982 the Committee referred to discussions in which the-</PARA>
<PARA> Attorney-General put forward a proposal that the power accorded to each House of Parliament under the Acts Interpretation Act to disallow regulations and other instruments be extended to include power to disallow part of a regulation or instrument rather than the entire regulation or instrument, as at present. The Committee warmly endorses the suggestion, and looks forward to an amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Cooney, stated in this place in October 1986 that-</PARA>
<PARA> sometimes a single regulation contains many detailed sub-regulations. Part only of these provisions may infringe the Committee's principles. Indeed, a single clause only may be the sole objectionable part of the provisions. In these cases, a lack of a power to disallow part only of an instrument is an unacceptable flaw in the disallowance procedure. The Senate has to assess the merit of removing a number of good provisions in order to overcome a single bad provision. This flaw should be remedied as a matter of priority. </PARA>
<PARA>In its 1987 report, the Committee again raised the matter in the following terms-</PARA>
<PARA> With the increasing complexity of modern government a single amending regulation can often be long and detailed. Should one part of that amendment not meet with the approval of Parliament, a successful disallowance motion would obliterate the entire provision.</PARA>
<PARA>In this context, the Federal Court decision in Borthwick's Case in 1989 confirmed the power of each House to disallow discrete, individual regulations contained within a single, numbered paragraph of an instrument. Nevertheless, the power to disallow parts of an instrument is lacking. </PARA>
<PARA>The power of partial disallowance has been available since 1957 in relation to parts of ACT ordinances, yet the right to partially disallow a federal regulation is not yet available to the Federal Parliament. It is essential that this power be exercised by the Federal Parliament and this Bill will provide for that. Following acceptance of this Bill, the Parliament will be able to exercise a considered control and authority over delegated legislation rather than the take it or leave it choice with which it is presented at present.This Bill will overcome the problems arising from what the current Committee on Regulations and Ordinances described as an unacceptable flaw requiring remedy as a matter of priority. </PARA>
<PARA>I come now to the retrospective operation of regulations. The prohibition on the prejudicial retrospectivity of regulations contained in sub-section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 was interpreted by the High Court in 1942 as applying only to express retrospectivity and not to retrospective effect. This reading down of the provision must now be corrected. The Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has expressed its concerns about this matter in its reports. In its Eightieth Report for example in 1987, the Committee again set out sound reasons why the retrospective operation of regulations should be avoided. It noted that-</PARA>
<PARA> because of the complexity of the modern regulatory environment, it is not realistic to outlaw all retrospectivity in delegated legislation. However, it should be possible, and it is certainly preferable, to legislate to prohibit regulatory retrospectivity which is prejudicial to the rights of individuals unless this is expressly authorised by statute. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee then went on to again repeat its recommendations and urged the Attorney-General to amend sub-section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act to remove the possibility of the retrospective operation of regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>The above measures will improve parliamentary and public scrutiny of delegated legislation and provide the Senate with greater authority to exercise its rights of control and supervision of delegated legislation and I therefore commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 be referred immediately, that is, before the Bill is read a second time, to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, for inquiry and report on or before 13 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this motion is to allow the outrageous and draconian Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill to be properly considered by the Senate. In the House of Representatives we had the disgraceful experience of seeing this legislation guillotined through after less than four and a half hours of debate. Previously it was expected that this Bill would be debated in the Senate at this time. However, it has been postponed to the Budget Session. This would seem to me to be an opportunity for those hundreds of people who have written in, expressing outrage at this ban on political advertising, to come before a Senate committee to give their evidence so that a proper evaluation can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of all Australians, and this is not entirely recognised through the community, I should explain that this Bill would have the effect of banning from the air waves for all time advertisements containing any political reference whatever, to Federal, State or local government. It would also mean that politicians and interest groups would have no opportunity to present their messages or appeal for funds directly to the Australian public, but will have their messages filtered through the press gallery or current affairs programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Australian Democrats have taken a view that that part of the Bill will not survive because they support us. In fact, they do not support us. Our view is that we are totally opposed to the ban in any shape or form; the Democrats have taken the view that they are opposed to a total ban. There is a vast difference between those two views, because being opposed to a total ban means that the Democrats want some watered down provision with very stringent regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Bill, which would implement an unprecedented denial of freedom of speech, is to have any proper scrutiny at all, then it is essential for an all-party committee to allow the people of Australia to be heard. The referral to the Standing Committee would give them this opportunity-an opportunity that they will not get unless we take advantage of the winter recess to refer the matter to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a ground well of community outrage against the Government's proposal, and my office has been flooded with calls from groups and individuals protesting against the ban. I have not yet shown this to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), but I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of the people who have communicated with us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A referral of the Bill to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs would allow all its implications to be fully considered. Matters which call for investigation include the following. They would include the Bill's effect on freedom of expression, particularly freedom of political expression; the conflict between the Bill and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to prohibit the broadcast of advertisements containing references to State and/or local political issues. They would also include ensuring equitable treatment of all donors to any political party; and whether there is adequate protection from intimidation for those groups of individuals making donations. I do not mean just intimidation after a disclosure has been made, but the coercion that we have all heard about at WA Inc. in forcing people to make donations for political favours. Another matter that could be investigated is the question whether there are sufficient penalties provided to prevent political donations being extracted by coercion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All these interests, including members of the general public, have a right to have their views considered by the Senate. Unless the Standing Committee is given a reference today, there may well be no time available for this process of consultation to occur. We trust that this reference will meet with support from all parties in the Senate, and we particularly hope that the Democrats will be willing to allow this degree of public participation in the law making process. If they agree with us that this legislation is not fit for passage by the Senate, then the most logical course is for the Standing Committee to be given the opportunity to properly scrutinise it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this motion. We do so because of a number of reasons, and I will take a few moments to explain them. It is quite apparent to us that this is a deferral action in the classic way that Liberal governments in this country have approached issues such as this. We are talking here not only about going very much to the core of our electoral process and the way in which parties are funded, but also as to how transparent that funding process is. This also goes to the question of the costs of campaigning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some basic points that need to be taken into account when one considers what has been proposed by the Opposition. This matter has not been raised in a vacuum. It has been raised at the conclusion of a long and exhaustive process of discussion in this Parliament. We have had a parliamentary committee, namely the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which has looked at the twin problems of the costs of campaigning as well as disclosure provisions. In respect to the latter the Committee has come up with a whole series of proposals which evidence the fact that the disclosure provisions that are now in place are really a farce. That was the one conclusion that one can draw from that Committee's report. It came up with a series of proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basic point is that the proposals embodied in this legislation are a response to that Committee's report. It is a committee which exhaustively assessed this issue and came up with recommendations in respect of both areas under contemplation. In respect of that most important area of disclosure, it made a number of specific recommendations. They are the recommendations which are in substantial part embodied in the Government's legislation. The matter has been exhaustively assessed in respect of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the other aspect of the legislation-the question of costs of campaigning and how we tackle that-the Government has responded in two ways. We have done so in respect of the level of public funding and in respect of the costs of electronic campaigning. Our response is different to that of the Committee. The issue was discussed by the Committee and the Committee has come up with a proposal for free time, to which the Government has spelt out why it has rejected it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite apparent-and we can read numbers-that the Government's total proposal will not get through the Senate. I still believe that it is the best and fairest way to go, and I will continue to believe that. The reality is that in respect of both legs of the Bill the matter has been exhaustively assessed and the Government is responding to a parliamentary committee report.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators have asked that we go through another parliamentary committee process. They do so knowing that the path that they claim to object to-namely, the advertising ban-will not in its totality get through this place. They do so for another reason, which I believe is the most important reason-it is insidious and it is one that they will not admit to publicly because they know they have absolutely no right on their side in respect of that-and that is the proposal about deferring the introduction of disclosure provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen this procedure applied elsewhere. A number of years ago, Mr Greiner promised disclosure legislation in New South Wales. In doing so, he made it very clear that he would not send the proposal off to another parliamentary committee on the never-never. But that is precisely what he finally finished up doing. Why? Because the conservatives, the Liberal and National parties, in this place and in every other Parliament in this Commonwealth have consistently-and the record shows it very starkly-run away from full disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's proposal is to make as transparent as possible the disclosure provisions in this country. No degree of misinformation or distortion from the Opposition about what the Government's proposal is all about will conceal that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to speak much longer other than to say that we and the community are concerned to ensure that the funding of the political process in this country is both clean and transparent. We will not tolerate any further delay. We will not defer it and put it on the never-never, as the Opposition would love us to. We will not bow to pressures from the brown paper bag brigade from Queensland or those who run the Liberal Party. I will not go through the whole litany of quotes that I can put to the Senate in terms of Liberal Party opposition to disclosure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal of Senator Parer is to send the aspect of political broadcasts in the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for report back to the Senate when we reconvene for the Budget session. I thought that was necessary to say since the Senate has so recently been in some turmoil with the political parties, whose massive and questionable slush funds match each other, irrespective of whether it is the brown paper bags or black briefcases. That is what is we are debating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The actual proposal is to send off to a committee legislation which we already know will not pass in anything like the form that it is in before this chamber. Since April this year, the Government has known that the proposal in the legislation for a blanket ban on political advertising in the electronic media that the Opposition says is its major concern is not on. Today we have the Opposition proposing that through the recess the resources of the parliamentary committee, the general public who might be called before it, and the politicians involved should be engaged in an exercise in absolute futility. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly we agree with the Opposition, as we have said publicly, that the Government's proposal to eliminate electronic advertising of political matter is unacceptable. We agree with the Opposition. I do not know whether that constitutes doing a deal with the Opposition, but we agree with the Opposition. Those aspects of the Bill will not pass. Therefore, we will not send that significant part of the legislation off to a Senate committee. The Australian Democrats are quite clear on disclosure and have been since our formation in 1977. We support it and will support those aspects of the Bill with amendment to make it even tighter, if we believe that is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Democrats believe should be done during this parliamentary recess, and what is being done by us, is that amendments to address the questions which this Bill raises-the questions of political party funding, the costs and effectiveness of election campaigning, and amendments to bring a better piece of legislation out of the process in the Parliament-should be put together, circulated, discussed and negotiated. That is the work that should be done in the recess, not a mechanism which would hold up that process. It is work that will bring us to addressing those very real concerns which we share with the Government-the costs of campaigning and the process of political party funding in this country. Those are issues of concern to the Democrats. We welcome this legislation because it provides us with a vehicle, firstly, to call the political parties and their backers to account, which will happen through the disclosure provisions, and, secondly, to regulate in the area of political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> Our priority is amendments which we have had before this place previously-most recently in May last year via former Senator Macklin-to introduce truth in advertising. At the moment, the Electoral Act is a licence to lie. We will put those amendments forward. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also announced publicly that we want to regulate in the area of advertising to insist that political advertisements are informative and not just ad agency hype, which not only gobbles up money but also does not give any information to the voters. Our amendments will require a talking heads process. We will get those amendments before the political parties, the public and the people who have written to us, and we will discuss them and make comment. When we return here in August, we will be ready to discuss and debate that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very happy if Senator Parer and his colleagues want to do a deal with the Democrats on this matter, just as we have done, for instance, on the Comcare legislation. Does he remember how we sat together and removed the age discrimination provisions from Comcare not two days ago? Was that a deal? No, we negotiated, we agreed and we voted together. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the wool tax? We have brought that down between us to 10 per cent. Was that a deal? No, we negotiated, we voted, we sat together and we improved that legislation. What about Telecom? The Opposition and the Democrats removed the Government's ability to charge $1m to Telecom. Was that a deal? As far as I am concerned, it was not. We did that because we disagreed about the legislation; nevertheless, we did it. If we sit together on our amendments to this legislation, I will be perfectly happy, and if we sit together on some of the Opposition's amendments to this legislation I will be perfectly happy. But we have to get on with the job. The Opposition it trying to whip up a public furore. Members of the Press Gallery could not be more bored when one tells them what this exercise is-an exercise in absolute futility and, even worse, an exercise in the waste of public money. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not support this motion. We will get on with the job and we will get this legislation passed in a form which will benefit the electoral process in this country as early as we possibly can in August. We regret that the Senate has dragged its heels for so long and that we have not had a chance to get it through before now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I want to make clearly is that this legislation has not been to a committee, despite the comments of the Minister. He is talking about a committee looking at the subject area of the past-not a committee looking at the legislation currently before the Senate chamber. In relation to Senator Powell's suggestion that this is an exercise in futility, is it an exercise in futility to give the public the opportunity to express a point of view about legislation that is crucial? It will not hold up the Bill by a day. That is the other point that ought to be made. This process will not hold up this legislation at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All we ask is that the voice of the people be able to be heard on this legislation. Each of us in this chamber, by our vote, will be indicating to all Australians the worth of their right to express an opinion on a piece of controversial legislation-not just any piece of legislation, but legislation which, more than any other legislation that has been introduced in an Australian Parliament, in effect makes a mockery of the value that we ought to be placing on democracy. Some might say that that is an emotive term, but how else do we describe legislation which has been reviled by the Human Rights Commissioner; which breaches the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; which is authoritarian and which acts as a restriction on the right of free speech; and which leaves more than one million illiterate with no way of exercising their right to informed political choice? That is what we are talking about in the legislation currently before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that, I believe that there is no choice at all. If we believe in democracy, if we believe in free speech-which is the first and vital component of democracy-then we can only say yes to the resolution put forward by Senator Parer. We can only say yes to allowing debate which will, I hope, ultimately have this legislation referred a committee so that concerned groups and individuals can express a point of view. To refuse that right, that option, is to vote against democratic rights, freedom of speech and democratic government. How else would one describe refusing the right of the Law Council of Australia to put a point of view? And should it not be putting that point of view at this stage of the process, not at the end of the process when the Bill has passed through this chamber?</PARA>
<PARA> We want the opportunity for community groups to look at the original Bill so that the amendments that Senator Powell talks about can be considered by this chamber through a process by which the legislation passes before the chamber. We send far less controversial and far less contentious legislation off to committees and the public for scrutiny on almost a daily basis-and so it should be, so that the public and interest groups have an opportunity to put a point of view on the legislative direction of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Why in this instance, on such an important piece of legislation, should we deny the right for that opportunity to be passed on to various groups within the community? Some have said that this would place an extra burden on a committee in the recess, that some people have perhaps made other arrangements for the recess. There is the other point of view, which was expressed in no uncertain terms, that proposed amendments will suffice and listening to the people is seemingly a waste of time. That is what Senator Powell said in her speech just a moment ago. Oh, for the civil libertarians in our community to be privy to such evidence of cynicism and opportunism-that Senator Powell is the wisdom of all amendments for this legislation and is not prepared to put them to the Human Rights Commissioner! Perhaps it is the Human Rights Commissioner who has written in reply to Senator Powell about the Democrats' talking heads proposals, with which he does not agree, which Senator Powell does not want to put on the public record during a committee hearing. Perhaps the Democrats do not want that explained to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Government not proceeding with this legislation in this last week of the sittings? Is it because the New South Wales Labor Party is so strapped for funds as a result of the last New South Wales State election campaign that it does not want the disclosure measures brought in until it gets the debt fixed up? Is that the reason why we are not debating this matter this week-so that there is an extra couple of months to get the cash in to repay the debt of the last election campaign? Why has the Government gutted its legislation? In the early hours of the legislation being considered in the House of Representatives an amendment was moved by the Government that effectively guts the disclosure provisions of this legislation-an outrageous amendment proposed by the Government. Should that not be open to public scrutiny, debate and comment by interest groups in the community?</PARA>
<PARA> All I say to the Senate is this: what is there to hide by opening this legislation up? What is there to hide by not allowing the Human Rights Commissioner to put his evidence on the public record? What is there to hide by restricting the Law Council's putting a point of view publicly on this legislation? Any amendments that we consider in due course have the benefit of input from sections of the community which have a rightful place to express a point of view to influence the legislative direction of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised at the contribution made this morning by Senator Powell. Senator Powell comes from the Party that used to say that it wanted to keep everyone else here honest. She comes from the Party that says, `Legislation should be properly scrutinised', and from the Party that advocates very strongly the referral of contentious Bills, and Bills that have any complicated legislative framework, whether they are contentious or not, off to committees for proper consideration. What she now says about the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, one of the most contentious Bills that has been attempted to be carried through this place, is that she has had a look at the Bill and decided what she wants, so there is no need for a parliamentary committee to look at it-thereby removing the right of a whole range of people to put their views to the Parliament about the impact of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Olsen has mentioned some of these people: the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Commissioner and many others. Senator Olsen has ably put the point that referring this Bill to a committee will not delay by one day the passage of the legislation in whatever form it ends up in. Senator Powell's argument is that, because she has had a look at the Bill and knows what amendments she wants to move, she will talk about it with the Government and that will be okay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Deputy President, if Senator Powell's argument is sustainable in relation to this Bill, it is sustainable in relation to any other Bill that is far less controversial and far less complicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I look forward to seeing Senator Powell and her cohorts follow through with that and never ask for a Bill or any section of a Bill to go to a committee. She will have plenty of time to look at the problems; she will be able to discuss Bills with whom she chooses-Government, Opposition, various interest groups-and she will be totally satisfied that we will come to the best solution through that process. This morning she has basically made a case for saying there is no need for referral of Bills to select committees or particular committees of this Parliament. I think that is a pretty disgraceful exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to what the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) wants to say. He wants to say that we need a complete ban on advertising. He admits that he will not get that. Some arrangement has to be made with the Australian Democrats. He says he wants a complete ban so that public order can be maintained. The aspect of public order that he thinks is under threat is the free and proper conduct of elections. He says elections are under threat because of corruption. He puts forward no evidence that corruption goes on because of the high cost of advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> If he turned his mind to the matter he would see where corruption takes place. We would be kidding ourselves if we said it never took place; Western Australia is a classic example of just how strongly corruption occurs amongst some Labor governments of this country. Where corruption does take place, it is, by and large, in my view, not because the parties or politicians have a need for funds for advertising but because some evil rich people want to buy governments; they want to buy policies. </PARA>
<PARA> If a government has no need of advertising money or a lesser need of advertising money, what will be offered is something different-cash for oneself as opposed to cash to run one's party. In other words, removing a party's need for funds for electronic advertising does not remove any incentive for corruption, because we still have corrupt people in the community who want to buy governments off and we still have, as we see in Western Australia, governments which can be bought off. If they are not bought off by money for advertising, they will be bought off by something else. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a point that Senator Alston also made: public order maintained through free and proper conduct of elections cannot be maintained unless we have freedom of speech. That is an essential requirement of the free and proper conduct of elections. In relation to this, the Government purports to say, `That is all right; people will hear on the television news, radio news and current affairs programs what is happening'. </PARA>
<PARA> But, if we turn our attention to press reporting, what this Government thinks of the press gallery and the media in general is quite instructive. In only the last couple of days, Mr Deputy President, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the leader of your Party, has said that the people in the gallery here, and the media around Australia, lack integrity; but in the next breath he says Australians should trust the media for information about what the parties think and what the policies are. </PARA>
<PARA> On a number of occasions Mr Keating has said that we just cannot trust people in the gallery. He says that they are intellectually deficient, that he has to tone his arguments down to get them to understand. During the Gulf war, the media told us that one of our ships had been involved in a collision, when no such thing had happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one am not happy to say in this place that the information about what the Government wants to do or what the Opposition wants to do, or information about Democrat policies, should be passed on to the public through the electronic media. This is a massive attack on the maintenance of public order; it is an attack on the free and proper conduct of elections because it is an attack on the parties and candidates freely putting their views, unedited, in those elections. This Bill should be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill continues to be about freedom of speech, which is the point that all speakers from the Opposition ranks have made. But this particular debate concerns the reference of the Bills to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to investigate, as we do with other Bills, just how parts of it will operate. During the period of debate, prior to the Bill being introduced, again and again we on this side of the House asked questions of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), and the Minister would simply reply, `Wait until the Bill comes down and you will see'. We waited until the Bill came down and now we see arising many questions that have been of concern to other Australian citizens and organisations; quite clearly there is a case to have these matters looked at and interpreted by a committee hearing evidence and making determinations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the sorts of things that it would be eminently reasonable to have investigated. In looking at the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, the first thing that leaps out from the page is that there is no definition of `advertisement' per se. I refer honourable senators to page 5 of the explanatory memorandum, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>While the Bill defines `political advertisement', it does not define the concept of `advertisement' itself. `Advertisement' is intended to be given the widest possible interpretation, consistent with what is ordinarily understood to be an advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that to be interpreted by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT)? Do we believe that there is sufficient power or that that is the proper course of action? What is to be the proper modus operandi of the Bill and what will be its effect on things such as talkback radio? I read on from page 5 of the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA>It is intended-</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress the use of the word `intended', a word which in no way conveys the impression that this matter is settled, and therefore it should be investigated-</PARA>
<PARA>that `advertisement' will not include for example bona fide reports of news or current affairs, including documentaries, talk back programmes or editorial comment by broadcasters. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a proper area that ought to be investigated to see what is meant by the terms `bona fide' and `news or current affairs'. What is the status of a person who goes onto talkback radio and makes a political statement-that is, a statement containing political matter as defined within the Act? Does it constitute an advertisement; would that matter be determined by the ABT; and are we satisfied that justice is not only done but appears to be done by that body? As I said in a press release that I put out very early in this debate, it is like giving Dracula the keys to the blood bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABT is headed by a man who, although he may-and will-strive to carry out his duties in a correct way, is known to be an Australian Labor Party aficionado, somebody who has been a paid employee of the ALP and a Senate candidate of the ALP. As I have said before, it is important that justice is not only done but seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other things that we can look at. What is a political advertisement on one's own behalf? The Bill specifically outlaws advertisements which are put to air by broadcasters themselves. It says that they may not put to air a political advertisement on their own behalf. What is that meant to encompass? We need to hear evidence on how that will work. Is the penalty reasonable? Prior to the introduction of the Bill, we asked questions. We asked whether, if someone breached the Act, they would be fined, and whether, if they refused to pay the fine, they would be imprisoned. Thereby we would have imprisonment for exercising freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has attempted to get around this dilemma by saying, `No, we will not do it that way; we will cancel the licence of the broadcaster'. How does that affect the rights of shareholders and employees? Is that a fair and equitable remedy? We need to hear evidence as to whether that is so. </PARA>
<PARA> How broad is the right of Government departments to advertise in the period other than the period after which the writs are issued? People should bear in mind that only the Government of the day will know that date. Right up until the issue of the writs, it will be able to tell its departments what time they can book space. They can run advertisements right up to the day of the issue of the writs. How broad is that right and what fetter is upon it? We need to hear evidence on that?</PARA>
<PARA> We need to hear how wide the powers of the ABT are. Not only is the ABT to have its present powers, but also it is to get extended powers. It is to get the right to apply for injunction-like remedies. It will have a wide range of powers to be able to interpret. How reasonable and how defined are those powers? What are the rights of appeal from decisions made by the ABT?</PARA>
<PARA> Another question that needs to be examined is the meaning of the amendment that the Government itself has moved, whereby the government of the day will be given power by regulation-not under legislation debated in this chamber but by regulation-to determine who shall be required to file a return showing disclosure of donations received. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be open to the Government, for instance, to exempt a State union or a particular solicitor's trust fund and say that it need not disclose. It may, by regulation, say that it need not be disclosed. It also has the power by regulation to set the limit above which disclosure must be made. So, we need to see whether those particular regulations would constitute a Henry VIII clause-that is, that the intent of the legislation or the legislation itself may be altered by regulation. The use of Henry VIII clauses is, within the Westminster system, absolutely and utterly disdained, and a recent conference in Perth on this question resolved that there should be no acceptance that there is any legitimate use of regular Henry VIII clauses at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that needs to be made is that we need to hear from those who have made points of view on the public record, such as Brian Burdekin, the Law Council of Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the National Freedom of Blind Citizens, and the Australian Council of Social Service. Our Committee needs to hear from each of them. Finally, if honourable senators want to know someone else's opinion, the editorial in this morning's Australian states that the ad ban Bill is `a piece of chicanery' and that the `self-interest is breathtaking' on the part of the Government. Full disclosure is what we require. As I have said before, in terms of full disclosure, we need to see the deal that has been done between the Government and the Democrats such that the Democrats will not support this motion to refer this legislation to a committee this morning. </PARA>

Why the Minister would regard someone expressing that view with contempt is, I imagine, simply because it is a summation of the Government's view of this matter. As Senator Bishop has just quoted, the editorial in the Australian, which describes the ad ban as a piece of chicanery, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Federal Government's legislation to ban political advertising reaches new heights of political cunning. </PARA>

<PARA>On today's form, the Democrats have been successfully duchessed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I am the only senator currently in the chamber who was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters which discussed this whole question at length. I was somewhat intrigued, to put it mildly, to hear what the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) said, that the Bill currently before the Parliament is an attempt to address the matters raised in that report. In fact, we on that Committee spent days and days considering heaps of submissions and examining many witnesses, and a report was presented to the Parliament. That report dealt with the questions of political broadcasting and disclosure, to the extent that the legislation currently before the chamber deals with questions of disclosure raised by that Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It can possibly be argued that the Minister was correct in saying that that was a response to this Committee's report. To the extent that the Bill deals with political broadcasting or advertising, it does not reflect the views even of the majority of that Committee and the majority's recommendations. I happened to have disagreed with the majority recommendations even at that time because, as honourable senators will see in my dissenting report, I concluded that the recommendations were unlikely to achieve their stated objective of ensuring that voters who followed the electronic media would be adequately informed of the issues at stake in any election and of releasing political parties from an implied reliance on major donors. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not think that even those recommendations would achieve those objectives, and certainly I do not think that the current proposals-nor, from what I have heard, the Australian Democrats' amendments or proposals-would achieve that objective either. I have heard senators here, including Senator Powell, say across the chamber, `All right, we can do a deal with senators around the chamber' or `with the Opposition and the Government', and I presume that that applies to me as well. I am not actually interested in making arrangements between ourselves on a question which strikes at the very heart of democracy and the integrity of the political process. All those issues should be right out in the open because we, as parliamentarians, quite frankly cannot be trusted in matters where our self-interest is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mean that as a reflection on the honourable intentions of any senator, including myself. I say, `cannot be trusted', but `trusted' is probably not the correct word. I am not capable of being so disinterested in these particular matters as to come up with a proper conclusion which would ensure the integrity of the political process unless the people-that is, the voters and other groups within society-know what we are on about. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the way to do that is to ensure that this Bill-which is different, as I have said, to the recommendations that came from that Committee-goes to a committee so that members of the voting public can come before that committee to express their views directly. Whether that be the Committee suggested by Senator Parer, or the usual process adopted in relation to complicated Bills or Bills which contain major policy issues of sending them off to a standing committee, I do not know. All we have before us today is that this measure be referred to a committee. Because that will give the opportunity to the voting public to have their say about what we as politicians should do to ensure the integrity of the political process, I agree with this motion and I hope that it is carried. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 and allied Bills was interrupted last night, we were discussing the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and in particular the conclusions and recommendations of a Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) review of the existing bounty on machine tools and robots. A further sensible amendment which has arisen from the BIE report is the proposal to make eligible for bounty all equipment produced in the bountiable categories, whether sold in the domestic market or overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also a proposal to introduce a minimum annual production threshold before any bounty may be claimed. I will deal with that later when discussing all the minimum annual thresholds which are proposed in the Bill. The computer bounty is also to be expanded to include local manufacture of printed circuit boards from 1 July 1991. This measure is supported by the Australian Democrats. The consequent removal of the current tariff will assist local industry in many sectors such as telecommunications, computers and aerospace. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary matter of contention in this Bill is the proposal to limit various bounty payments by creating minimum annual thresholds which firms must exceed to qualify for assistance. We have heard that Senator Olsen will be moving an amendment on behalf of the Opposition to stop this. The second reading speech of the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The primary objective of the threshold is to encourage efficient manufacturing in those sectors by eliminating from the schemes peripheral production by firms not significantly committed to bountiable production in the respective industries. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, marginal producers, as determined purely by production levels and not by unit costs or any efficiency measure, are to be denied bounty assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposals mean that manufacturers may not be entitled to receive bounty unless they have produced a quantity of bountiable equipment under the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984, the Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Act 1981 or the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textiles Yarns) Act 1981 which entitles them to a bounty of $10,000 for a year of production-that is, only if a small business produces enough of any of the bountiable items stated above to qualify for that bounty. No bounty would be payable if the entitlement is less than $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The inequity of this proposal is obvious. What about the firm that would have been entitled to $9,900? Will it produce extra useless product just to qualify for that bounty? Will it be tempted to fiddle the books in order to qualify? What of the small business which would only qualify for a bounty of $1,000? Why should that be denied to it? The minimum bounty proposed for the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act 1977 is even more extreme. The Bill sets the lower limit at $100,000, which is a huge threshold to exceed for a small business. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter dealt with in the Opposition amendments is the proposed introduction of a minimum annual threshold of $200,000 of value added for eligibility for payment under the Bounty (Metal Working Machines and Robots) Act 1985. It is not clear why the criterion was minimum bounty payments for some of the bounty thresholds and in the case of the robotic bounty a minimum value added criterion was accepted by the Government. What will these minimum threshold measures yield in savings? According to the Minister's second reading speech, they have no financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA> Why, in a period of falling national production and rapidly escalating unemployment, are we debating a measure which is specifically designed to cut small-scale production? Surely, the few people who are employed in that production have to be protected, at least until the employment outlook has improved. It is for these reasons, and the fact that any figure which could be adopted would be totally arbitrary anyway, that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the Opposition's amendments which seek to remove the minimum threshold provisions from the Bill. In relation to the Opposition's second reading amendment, it will probably come as no surprise to the Opposition that the Democrats are ideologically opposed to almost all of it, except for the last piece. We will be moving our own second reading amendment later in the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is debating the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 and the Customs Amendment Bill 1991. These Bills are a by-product of the Government's industry statement delivered on 12 March. The Government stated that its measures were to improve the product capacity of the Australian economy to make it more competitive and its most powerful spur was tariff reductions. The tariff reductions proposed were that general assistance be reduced from 10 and 15 per cent in 1992 to 5 per cent by 1996; passenger motor vehicle tariffs be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent in the year 2000; textile, clothing and footwear tariffs be reduced to 25 per cent by the year 2000; and general agricultural tariffs be reduced in line with general tariffs-in other words, down to 5 per cent by 1996. These reductions would bring Australia's nominal tariff rates down to approximately 3 per cent-an average effective rate of assistance down by 5 per cent in the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, I would like to address my remarks particularly to the effect that these tariff cuts will have on agricultural products. Rural producers sometimes wonder why they have to have more a rapid pace of reform than any other industry. They accept top down tariff reductions, but these cuts seem to come from the bottom up. They feel that the costs of the imported products will benefit by these tariff cuts because they become the market price indicators. This applies particularly to farmers that grow processed vegetables who come under increased pressure to accept lower prices because of the presence of subsidised imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his 12 March statement referred to the European Economic Community, United States of America (USA) and Japanese farm subsidies, which average more than $300 billion a year, and to the heavy burden placed on the farmers by corrupted world agricultural trade. The solution proposed in the March statement was to maintain our vigorous campaign for substantial reform of agricultural trade in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round of negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at Australia's tariff cuts since 1988, the GATT secretariat estimates that they involve an average trade weighted cut of up to 44 per cent. However, the difference between these other countries and Australia is as reported in the March publication of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade:</PARA>
<PARA>The March industry statement cuts will bring us into line with those of other industrialised countries, most of which-still also use a battery of non tariff measures such as quotas and subsidies to restrict imports. </PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA>At the current Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, most participants have so far failed to reach the agreed target of an average tariff reduction of a third-a level exceeded in Australia's initial offer based on the 1988 reductions. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to explain:</PARA>
<PARA>While no other country has yet matched the comprehensive liberalisation that Australia has announced since the Round began in 1986, we remain optimistic that other countries will move in Australia's direction and we will certainly continue to press for this. </PARA>
<PARA>I am becoming disappointed at the actions of other countries in the world. It seems that Australia is the only country that is progressing down the free trade route. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trying to lead the world in this campaign for free trade; we are out there with the drum and the banner but no-one is following. The farmers have just about had a gutful of it. In today's newspapers, we find that the USA has sold Kuwait many hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of wheat that is heavily subsidised through trade subsidies. The report, to which I have referred, describes the present world trade situation in which Australian producers have to work. The desired free world trade situation at the moment is not a reality. So it is no wonder that many rural industries subjected to corrupt world markets are struggling and struggling badly. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Government is not acknowledging, by further reducing tariffs now, and particularly without simultaneously introducing other reforms to reduce industry input costs. I ask the Minister at the table, Senator Tate, who I believe is a realistic person, how his Government can reduce tariffs while pursuing accord mark VI. How on earth can we increase the cost of products in Australia, whether they be manufactured products, grown products or processed products, pushing up the price on the one hand, while reducing tariff levels on the other? It is a complete impossibility. All the Government is doing-and I hope that Senator Tate takes this back to Cabinet-is increasing the length of the line of unemployed people. It is not possible to do both things: we cannot push up costs on the one hand and decrease tariff levels on the other. This should be obvious to everyone, and needs no more than a grade 4 level of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> By means of this Bill vegetable tariffs are to be reduced in July, to 10 per cent, and then to 5 per cent by 1996. A 5 per cent tariff will also apply to produce from developing countries. Furthermore, by this legislation, some vegetable tariffs are to be bound under GATT. This means that Australia is giving a binding commitment to our competitors that our vegetable tariff levels will never be raised. It does not matter what happens with regard to imports, production subsidies and export subsidies-we can have subsidised producers products flooding into this nation-this Government has said, `We are going to lead the world. We will bind our tariffs. We will bind our farmers, and we will not give them any assistance at all'. </PARA>
<PARA> By binding vegetable tariffs, it seems that vegetables are the token produce exposed to greater threat from imports in order to win more international praise for the Government. This is being done without regard by the Government for the consequences to the horticultural industry, which last year sustained imports of $2.1 billion of food products. At the same time, no corresponding benefits seem to have been obtained for Australian products in overseas markets. The consequences of reduced and bound vegetable tariffs will be devastating for the horticultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In my home State of Queensland, over the past five years the efficient pineapple industry has lost 22 per cent of the domestic market to imports. Yet the pineapple industry is suffering badly from such factors as the effects of cheap subsidised imports, reduced tariff levels and an increase in multi-national companies sourcing their pineapples from developing countries. Most of this product has some sort of subsidy or is countervailed in some way. It is the same with citrus growers, where tariff levels will be reduced to 3 per cent by 1996. Brazilian orange juice concentrate comes into Australia at a 5 per cent tariff level, as Brazil is classified as a developing country, despite its massive 36 per cent share of the world market. Surely in these economic times there is a need for the Government to remove preferred national concession in relation to some products where the country involved is able to influence world trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to tomatoes, imports went up by 103 per cent last year, while at the same time Australian tomato and potato farmers were ploughing their crops back into the ground. It is well known that some European countries massively subsidise tomato production, encouraging overproduction. The subsidy level for tomatoes in the European Community (EC) is $425 per tonne, equivalent to 19c per can, while the Australian price is only $120 per tonne. The subsidy is three times the actual Australian price. Last year, 28,750 tonnes of EC tomatoes were imported to Australia, yet Australian canned tomato production was only 18,991 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsidised vegetables are making inroads into Australian canned food sales. Yesterday it was reported that Queensland pea growers have had to accept a cut of 12.5 per cent for their vegetables going to the processors, as otherwise Edgell would be unable to compete against imported products, and it would have pulled out of the Queensland market if the price cuts were not accepted. I have sympathy for Edgell and I have great sympathy for the Australian farmers, because Edgell cannot compete against the products that are being imported, mainly under generic brands by Coles, Woolworths and the other chains. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the amount of imported frozen peas rose by 5.42 per cent; frozen corn by 11.62 per cent; frozen potatoes by a massive 72.2 per cent, when the Australian potato crop was being ploughed back into the ground; and canned asparagus by 22.32 per cent. I am not suggesting for one moment that there should be some form of protectionism, some sort of tariff barrier, but I am saying that Australian farmers are the most efficient in the world. They can compete against anyone. They can compete against low-cost countries and against low wages and still win, but they can never compete against the treasuries of the United States of America or the European Community. They just cannot do it. The EC uses other subsidy devices such as minimum farm prices, production aids, regional employment programs, government aid to set up food manufacturing plants, and export rebate schemes. Our farmers are left defenceless and naked against these subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States is the largest importer of tomato products and has a 100 tariff rate for EC tomato imports. The European Community dominates 85 per cent of the world's export markets and is excluded from the US market. It then has to seek alternative markets for its cheap subsidised tomatoes, with Australia being the target. It is less well known that Australian processors are reaching the point where imports are making them almost unviable. This means that the whole fabric of food production in Australia is threatened because of the effect of highly subsidised food imports. This situation is repeated in relation to many rural products. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a major Queensland primary and manufacturing industry, the sugar industry. The March industry statement, without any warning, changed the tariff regime for sugar. Fellow senators will remember the comprehensive Senate inquiry in 1988 which I moved to establish to set up a tariff regime until 1992 following the lifting of the embargo on sugar. The lifting of the embargo was a measure used by the Government as a bargaining tool in the Uruguay GATT negotiations. The sugar industry made this contribution and in turn expected to be able to rely on the tariff regime which was established by the Government and which, in the words of the Minister, was to be reviewed in 1992 by the Industries Assistance Commission, as it then was. The Government then put into place a specific tariff on both white and raw sugar imports of $115 a tonne until 1 July 1991, $95 a tonne until 1 July 1992 and $70 a tonne after 1 July 1992, with an Industry Commission inquiry to determine the tariff levels thereafter. Suddenly, without any consultation with the industry, the Government unilaterally ended this agreement-with a stroke of the pen, not even advising the industry what it intended to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the specific tariff rates were reduced from $95 to $76 a tonne as at 1 July 1991, and from $70 to $55 a tonne as at 1 July 1992. This means an immediate loss to the Queensland sugar industry of $13.1m in the next year and $10.3m in the following year. It also means a loss to the New South Wales industry of $3.8m-and it sustains a more severe loss than the Queensland industry on a pro rata basis. The Australian sugar industry is one of the most efficient in the world and it is recognised as a very low cost producer. Last year, it gave more than $1 billion in export earnings. This season, the Australian industry has endured massive fuel increases at harvesting times due to the Gulf war, droughts and floods, with a decrease of $300m in industry earnings this year. </PARA>
<PARA> What cannot be avoided is the fact that the Government broke a firm promise to the industry-that was, that the tariffs were as agreed until July 1992. That commitment was given by every party in this Parliament. The drop in world prices from US14.6c a pound last May to 8c a pound today places a heavy burden on sugar farmers when their costs are going up and their returns are going down. The only assistance the sugar industry has had was the tariff level for 20 per cent of its product sold on the domestic market. There is no assistance for the 80 per cent of its product on the export market sold at world prices. There is no level playing field out there for the sugar industry. It is kicking against a 40-knot breeze and it does not even get a change of end at quarter time. </PARA>
<PARA> The world prices are kept artificially low by subsidies. I think we should compare the subsidy levels of the major sugar producing countries. The European Economic Community subsidy is $551 per tonne, or 214 per cent of the world price; in Thailand, it is $447 a tonne, or 173 per cent; in the United States of America, it is $357, or 138 per cent of the world price; whereas in Australia, it is $76 for 20 per cent of the crop, or 28 per cent reducing to 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The broken promise on tariff levels is a disgraceful and disrespectful way to treat the Australian sugar industry. I cannot support the reduction in tariff levels and I will support an amendment. I had one drafted, but it is exactly the same as the Australian Democrats' amendment, which I will be supporting in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take up a point about the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). When this Bill was debated in the House of Representatives, it was disgraceful to hear the honourable member for Hinkler defend his Government's actions in breaking its promises to his constituents. The honourable member claimed to be the only sugar producer in the House of Representatives, and then went on to say that the Government's action gave the end users of sugar an opportunity to get on the front foot and become competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Courtice is not a sugar producer. He was left a sugar cane farm, but he could not hack it. He walked out, became a union representative and leased his farm. To say that he is a sugar producer is wrong: he is misleading the Parliament. He could not stay in there. But what Mr Courtice always does is drag this Parliament down and use it as a cess-pit to tackle anyone who has a disagreement with his Party. He has attacked every local government chairman in his area. He has attacked a number of other prominent citizens around the Bundaberg area; but when it comes to defending his constituents in this Parliament-and that is what he is sent down here to do-he is about as useless as an ashtray on a motor bike. </PARA>
<PARA> He did not mention the breaking of the Government's promise. He did not mention the loss to the individual farmers of $2,500 per farm and he did not mention the severe effect that the loss of income will have as it flows through the sugar communities. He represents one of the largest sugar communities-Bundaberg. Surely, he must care about the jobs that will be lost, about the income that will be lost by farmers in his constituency, and the rural towns already severely hit by his Government's engineered recession. He will see unemployment soar and businesses close down. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member does not seem to be concerned about that. He seems more concerned about toeing the Government line and promoting his chances to get into Cabinet. I can say to him that it would be the greatest insult to farmers in Australia if he were ever elevated above his present position as a back bench member of the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, with some liberality. He was also silent on the threat to his area of Bundaberg Sugar Co. being taken over by the British conglomerate, Tate and Lyle, until last week when he said that foreign investment should be allowed so that Australian companies can invest overseas. Bundaberg Sugar is not a company in need of foreign investment. It is a highly successful Australian company. In this interview he did not once mention the effect on his electorate or on the people of Bundaberg.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, the canegrowers are not satisfied with Tate and Lyle's assurances. They received absolute assurance from Tate and Lyle about the continuation of a single seller in the market, acquisition and the canegrowers' equity in any refinery. Yet the canegrower is not satisfied with an overseas owner who is heavily involved in the beet and corn syrup market in direct conflict with Australia's raw sugar industry. This poses a threat to the canegrowers' years of hard work and equity. It is undeniable that the effect of the Federal Government's economic policies has been to see the selling off of the Australian farm. As Australian firms have floundered, buyers have moved in from overseas for the bargains. This is not so in the case of Bundaberg Sugar; it is a prime takeover target simply because it has been so successful. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin and the Government have inflicted a further possible blow on the canegrowers and the future of the sugar industry with their approval of the Tate and Lyle foreign takeover bid for Bundaberg Sugar. The Queensland State Government-a Labor government-which is much closer to the scene, decided that it could not find a sufficient level of potential benefit which would flow from the proposal put forward by Tate and Lyle. The major concern was the potential effect on Bundaberg district canegrowers and domestic sugar industries flowing from Tate and Lyle's leading position in the international sweetener market. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Foreign Takeovers Act, the main criterion is that such a takeover is not judged contrary to the national interest. Mr Kerin has sadly let down the Bundaberg and Australian sugar growers by allowing in a foreign player with a proven conflicting interest to our industry. Let us hope that the decision was not made, as the newspapers suggest, to prove that Mr Kerin could be a decisive Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> A further Bill being considered cognately today is the Customs Amendment Bill. This Bill puts into effect the Government's announcement in the March industry statement that anti-dumping measures should be speeded up so the first preliminary stage could be reduced to 135 days, to be implemented by regulation. Also, it provides that farmers affected by dumping can bring actions as processors if their raw goods are closely related to the processed product and that anti-dumping duties stay in effect for the full three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition policy is that this first stage should be speeded up to 55 days with a further 120 days until the final investigation. Accordingly, I support the amendment of the coalition. As anti-dumping is the only means that the Government has left available to the Australian producers under the free trade stance, these amendments have been desperately needed. The Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I am a member, investigated the anti-dumping legislation and I believe it will bring down its report tomorrow. It is hoped that the Government will take action on the recommendations in implementing any further reforms suggested by that Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary industry should not be bearing the brunt of further tariff cuts without accompanying reforms that cut its costs. Australian primary producers are efficient by international standards. They can and do compete well in international markets, but they find it difficult and almost impossible to compete against the massive subsidies provided by the rest of the world. It is difficult to say that now is the time that agricultural tariffs should be reduced when the rest of the world is heavily subsidising-and increasingly subsidising-its industry. All other countries in the world are increasing subsidies and Australia is going one-out in decreasing tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have done just about everything possible to lead world trade. We have given away just about every bargaining chip that we had in the interests of getting world trade to take place. We have removed the sugar embargo. We are lowering the tariffs in this Bill, and we did it before in the 1988 economic statement. We have disbanded the domestic price for wheat and the binding of some vegetable tariffs. We are even harmonising our food standards with the international Codex standard. No-one can accuse Australia of not playing the world trade game. It is about time some other nations got in behind us. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's policy is for tariff reductions, but with simultaneous micro-economic reform. To do one without the other, as this Government is doing, is to jeopardise the survival not only of primary industry but also all industries in Australia. To pursue an increased wages policy and the Mark VI accord, which will increase wages by $12 a week, and another 6 per cent productivity increase with another 3 per cent on top of that, is quite wrong. It is jeopardising not only our primary industry, but also our secondary industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Already we have seen a reduction from 30 per cent to around 13 per cent in our manufacturing industries. Whilst I can support the reduction of tariffs, I find it very difficult to support when the Government is increasing costs to manufacturers while trying to reduce protection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to lead the Opposition in this debate on the Customs Amendment Bill 1991 and the allied Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991. With respect to the Customs Amendment Bill 1991, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate, while it is prepared to give the bill a second reading, is of the opinion that, in conjunction with the amendments to anti-dumping and countervailing procedures contained in the bill, the Government should further streamline these procedures so that Australian producers have adequate defence against dumped and subsidised imports, by condensing the entire preliminary investigation period to 55 days, after which provisional measures can be implemented, followed by a final investigation period of 120 days''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Customs Amendment Bill is to implement changes announced in the March industry statement relating to dumping and countervailing procedures. The Bill provides me with an opportunity to focus on the free trade messages inherent in the so-called dumping of produce. I am particularly concerned that to soften the message of protection reductions, which was the ostensible aim of the industry statement, the Government made a commitment to faster and more effective anti-dumping action. </PARA>
<PARA> Anti-dumping measures can be used as a protectionist measure. A deceptive belief is held by some that, for instance, when the subsidised Australian automotive industry sells goods on foreign markets at prices below that at which they are sold domestically, it is called an export success story-and I would cite the Capri. But when a subsidised American wheat farmer sells his produce in traditional Australian markets, he is an unfair trader who has dumped his produce. Clearly, we need more consistency. </PARA>
<PARA> Dumping should be seen for what it is-competition. Anti-dumping action can, if not properly used, lead to further yet less visible protection as it allows businesses to stand out from the cold winds of competition. More and more, as we see an international commitment to the reduction of overall tariffs, I find that the increase in non-tariff barriers by way of not only anti-dumping and countervailing mechanisms but also, of course, the ubiquitous health and safety regulations, can effectively take over the role where tariffs have been diminished. The coalition is strongly of the view that an anti-dumping mechanism must not be used as an alternative form of industry protection to shield industries from genuine international competition. Mr Acting Deputy President, I wonder if we could have a little less conversation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My thanks for the quietening of the conversation was meant as an act of courtesy on my part. The coalition is strongly of the view that an anti-dumping mechanism must not be used as an alternative form of industry protection to shield industries from genuine international competition, and I repeat that statement because it is an important one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having made the most important point, it is worth considering how the coalition government would approach reductions in industry protection. We have made it quite plain that our program to expose Australian industry to international competition will occur in conjunction with a systematic program of micro-economic reform. The coalition has consistently prescribed that cuts in protection should be accompanied by genuine micro-economic reform and that both the ball and the chain should be removed from import substitutions and potential and current exporters. Implementing these reforms together ensures that the benefits of both arms of reform are maximised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission has estimated that the benefit to the Australian economy of reducing protection alone will be to the tune of $4 billion. To reduce protection and make genuine micro-economic reform will see the economy realising $43 billion of additional growth. That is a most important aspect in an economy which is suffering from the recession that was planned by this Government-the one that the former Treasurer said we had to have. It is in this context that the opportunity for genuine reform of anti-dumping and countervailing regimes becomes available. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, we have the most unsatisfactory situation of intellectual dishonesty where the Government maintains that it has a genuine anti-dumping mechanism but, in reality, it is so drawn out and inefficient as to be largely ineffective. Some may argue that this is perversely in the interest of free traders such as myself, but I do not wish to be part of this deception. If the Government is going to do away with anti-dumping mechanisms, it should be explicit in doing so. What I would not do is have a lengthy, drawn out investigation period creating significant costs, knowing that local firms may be dissuaded from making anti-dumping applications. The interests of free trade may very well be served by such a course of action, but what a fraud would be served on Australian industry, and it is simply not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the logic which justifies the position that we take on this Bill and, indeed, the second reading amendment which I have just moved. The logic is quite simple: for a country to have an anti-dumping mechanism, the only honest course of action is for that mechanism to be both efficient and effective. Because of the danger of the mechanism yielding arbitrary protection for certain industries, the procedure must be balanced and thorough. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current economic climate, it has been argued by my colleague Mr McLachlan, in the other place, that the current mechanism and, indeed, the proposed new shortened mechanism, take so long that local industry, for all practical purposes, can be destroyed before the provisional measures can be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> My amendment calls on the Government to reduce the current three-tier investigation process to two-that is, a 55-day preliminary investigation period, after which provisional measures can be imposed, followed by a single 12-day final investigation stage. Honourable senators should turn their minds back to 1988 when the current arrangements were debated. At that time the coalition successfully moved amendments to shorten the first two stages of the Government's proposal of 70 days and 180 days to 55 days and 120 days. In 1988 Senator Button said that it could not be done. Perhaps he was thinking of the relative incompetence of the Customs Service in reaching quality findings. Not only has he proved to be wrong, but he is now himself reducing the times for the establishment of a prima facie case and preliminary investigation. Even this is not enough. An industry suffering material injury may have to wait four and a half months for relief by means of the provisional measure, and another four months for the Anti-Dumping Authority to undertake the final investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of my amendment would be to urge the Government to remove one layer of investigation and condense the primary investigation period to 55 days. In the 1986 review of the anti-dumping system by Professor Fred Gruen it was recommended that the Customs Service should make substantial efforts to meet targets of 55 days for preliminary findings and 120 days for findings in normal cases. That was the recommendation in 1986. It is surely a long time to have to wait to 1991 to move in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Amendment Bill makes other changes to anti-dumping and countervailing measures by increasing access of primary producers to the mechanism. This was recommended by Professor Gruen and was at the heart of the coalition's decision to require a Senate committee to investigate this matter. Upstream producers will now be able to claim relief from dumping and processed agricultural goods, provided that the goods are closely related to the raw agricultural material. The Bill also provides the calculation of a full dumping margin at the preliminary finding stage of a dumping inquiry to help speed up investigations. The condition supports this change. However, may I add that it is important to monitor the new provisions in light of changing international trading arrangements and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> A further change in this Bill relates to the sunsetting of countervailing measures so as to remove an anomaly whereby sunset provisions are dated from the first notice relating to subsidised product and not to the current notice. Finally, the Bill alters some Customs search procedures, extending the pool of judges for appointment as Division 1B judges under the Customs Act 1901. We do not oppose these changes, but I seriously commend our amendment as it would make the effectiveness of anti-dumping and countervailing measures effective and efficient, and thereby enhance the international trading capabilities of our potential and existing exporters and assist those who are engaged in substitution manufactures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, which we are now debating, the Government is addressing how it will set what it calls a level playing field for the motor vehicle industry, the textiles, clothing and footwear-TCF-industries, the vegetable industry and the sugar industry. What concerns me greatly is that the Government is doing this without regard to the impact of its policies on the competitive conditions within which producers in each of those industries work. In particular, I would like to address my comments to the effects of this legislation on one of Australia's most efficient industries, the sugar industry. Senator Boswell in his speech has dealt thoroughly with the effects that this legislation will have on other primary industries, such as tomato growing, and the growing of pineapples, peas, corn and potatoes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many argue about the merits of free trade and the abolition of tariffs, but they fail to address the real issue under discussion. It is not about whether we believe in free trade. It is simply whether we are prepared to give the nod to and turn a blind eye to a deliberate `breach of promise' by the Government. That promise to sugar growers was that the tariff regime for sugar would be $95 a tonne from 1 July 1990 to 1 July 1991, and then $75 a tonne after that until the Industry Commission inquiry guidelines were released. That promise was made to growers back in 1989 and, naturally, many subsequently made financial commitments based on that assurance. With industry policy, it is not just the policies that count; it is the consistency of those policies. When the ground rules are changed in the middle of the game, it is diabolical. The President of the Queensland Farmers Federation stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the reduction in the tariffs flies in the face of the transitional arrangements agreed to by the Senate Committee of Inquiry in 1988. These arrangements were developed through extensive consultation . . . as a transitional measure prior to the establishment of the long term position in the Industry Commission Inquiry scheduled for later this year. The proposed action makes a mockery of both the Senate Inquiry and the Industry Commission Inquiry. Indeed, it is a breach of the commitment provided to the sugar industry in 1988. It was a commitment by the Parliament, made after extensive consultation with all sectors of the industry and it included an appropriate review mechanism in the form of the Industry Commission Inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>Sugar growers have watched with trepidation the collapse of the wheat, wool and other rural industries. Forecasts for the sugar industry indicate a capitulation of prices during the next two years similar to that of wheat in the past two years, with growers expected to bear the brunt of the industry's problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Sugar prices have already fallen 45 per cent from last year. They fell from US$14.6c a pound in may last year to US$0.8c a pound. Growers have been aware of the price drop. Political and economic changes in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, and trade sanctions against Iraq have created a slump in overseas demand. Australian growers have prepared for the downturn by becoming more efficient. But they were taken by surprise when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in the industry policy statement in March, announced that tariffs were to be decreased faster than expected. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from a newspaper article of 13 March which carried the by-line, `Canegrowers King Hit'. That report quoted the Queensland Cane Growers Council Chairman, Mr Harry Bonanno, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>The March industry statement king hits the raw sugar industry at a time when it is already reeling from low sugar prices.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The industry statement was also a breach of the Government's promise not to change industry tariffs until after this year's Industry Commission inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>What good on earth is it having an inquiry if Government members have already changed their minds? That decision is expected to wipe on average $2,500, or almost 10 per cent, from sugar growers' incomes in one fell swoop. It represents a loss of $13.1m in Queensland and $3.8m in New South Wales this year alone, a total of $16.9m-a substantial amount to lose in anyone's language. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, when the Australian sugar industry was deregulated with embargoes and set domestic prices replaced by import tariffs, growers were told to prepare for competition on the domestic market from overseas producers. The decision was grudgingly accepted by growers because, by losing the set domestic price, they were to benefit when world export prices rose. By coincidence, sugar prices reached record levels during 1989 and the industry prospered. A slump in world stocks was combined with strong Asian demand. However, when the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, deregulated the domestic market in 1989, he gave the industry an assurance-I repeat, he gave an assurance-on a set tariff level to 1992 when an Industry Commission inquiry was expected to release new proposals. Mr Kerin said that the tariff regime for imported sugar would be $115 a tonne for 1989, $95 a tonne from 1 July 1990 to 1 July 1991 and then $75 a tonne after that until the Industry Commission inquiry guidelines were released. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that Mr Hawke's 12 March industry statement broke that agreement. In line with the Government's 1988 agreement of general tariff reductions, it cut sugar tariffs more than 20 per cent. The 1991 rate was cut from $95 a tonne to $76, with 1992 tariffs reduced from $75 a tonne to $55. Growers in the only two States producing sugar-Queensland and New South Wales-are expected on average to lose $2,500 per grower over the next two years. For many, the lower tariffs could be the last straw. </PARA>
<PARA> Sugar cane requires a five-year plan. Sugar growers have to establish goals and commit their finance to them. In doing so, they have to believe that commitments given by the Government will enable them to aim for those goals. Many marginal growers have been planning to diversify into other areas in anticipation of the lower tariffs and world prices, but the Government's move has brought many problems forward. However, in this amendment, the Government has moved unilaterally and without consultation with the industry. It has told the industry that there is no consultation to reduce the specific duty and that it will reduce the tariff from $95 to $70 in 1991 and from $70 to $55 in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, we are placing a number of our major industries in a position where there will be even more unemployed, where there will be an even larger number of those engaged in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry who will be shutting up plant and moving offshore and where, in the sugar and vegetable industries, we will find that imports will take over their market share. Reductions of tariffs in these areas, as some sort of grand gesture while they are not being matched by our trading competitors, is warm inner-glow nonsense. Indeed, regrettably, most competitors provide enormous subsidies to their producers. What makes it worse in the case of the sugar industry is that the Industry Commission has already started its inquiry into the protection that is to apply to the industry post-1 July 1992. So we are in a situation where, by adopting this tariff reduction, we are telling producers, `Do not take us at our word. Do not budget with your life savings according to our promises'. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand those who are sceptical of the promises of the Government. We all know that its record on broken promises is long. How many times have we recalled the promises-no capital gains tax; no increase in the Medicare levy; no child will live in poverty; no sales tax or excise on wine; inflation will keep below 5 per cent; home ownership will be within the reach of ordinary Australians; no need for any devaluation of the dollar; and Labor will reduce the price of petrol? The latest broken promise by the Prime Minister is that he would resign well before the next election. However, I do believe that we in the Opposition should not condone the deliberate breaking of promises by the Government. What makes it even more criminal is that we are doing so after people have committed their life savings in what has been an economically difficult time and thus their continued economic viability is threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, sugar trade takes place in what is probably the most corrupt market in the world for any commodity. Domestic subsidies are often several hundred per cent. Many countries have total import bans. Others, like the United States of America, have quotas guaranteeing that the world market is anything but free and fair. This means that there are enormous local subsidies applying in all the major sugar producing countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is any real progress being made in effecting any kind of liberalisation in world sugar trade. The major exporting nations have increased their concentration of total exports, with five countries now accounting for 77 per cent of the world trade in sugar. Australia ranks with Thailand, behind Cuba, and the European Economic Community (EEC). Australia has been building its tariff policy around its commitment to the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We are told that it is necessary for Australia to reduce its tariff barriers to demonstrate our good faith at GATT and to encourage the larger, more powerful nations to demonstrate that they will follow our lead. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is quite clear that this philosophy is not working. The EEC and other countries have failed to respond to any of the initiatives taken by Australia and other trading nations. The Australian sugar industry, which is more completely exposed to the chills of international competition than probably any other sugar industry in the world, is now exposed even further without any concessions having been won from our trading competitors. As Harry Bonanno said in an interview on Brisbane radio, no government is prepared to assist any industry at the moment. The major problem we have is the international scene where we are not getting a fair go in trade. Australia is proving to be lilywhite in the area of trade tariffs and no other country seems to be following along the same avenue. </PARA>
<PARA> It worries me that, in supporting this legislation, we are not meeting the assurances we have already made to the industry. As I said earlier, the issue here is not whether we believe in free trade but simply whether we give the nod and turn a blind eye to a deliberate breach of promise by this Government. The Government has changed the ground rules midstream. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that the total eastern coast of Australia from Cairns down to Grafton, or indeed Coffs Harbour, is to a very great degree dependent upon the sugar industry. This is the industry which is getting hurt and these are the people who are getting hurt. I cannot support further hardship for those in the sugar industry by condoning this about-face with other people's finances by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has shown that it is quite willing to callously break its promises. But we should not assist it by condoning its actions. I intend to join with my National Party Leader in the Senate, Senator Boswell, to support an amendment to be moved in the committee stage by the Australian Democrats which will meet my concerns about what the Government proposed increased reductions of tariffs contained in the March statement will do to rural industries in Australia and, in particular, to the very important sugar industry in the State of Queensland, which I represent in the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Collins just waits, he will find out. It might be the first thing that he learns this year, but he will find out. As we sit here and look at the crisis currently facing Australian primary industry, it is appropriate to address the differences between the policy of the discredited Government which sits opposite us on the Senate benches and those of us on this side of the Parliament. The differences are four.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, we do not believe that it is appropriate to have an increasing rate of reduction on tariffs while the Government fails to deregulate the labour market. This Government is very good at deregulating other people's industries, other people's interests, but it is no good at taking the hard decisions about deregulation of the labour market-and that, if anything, is the one decision which will return productivity and employment to the Australian economy. But this Government will not do it. While it parades itself around the world and takes the credit for deregulating one primary industry after another, it will not deregulate the labour market-and that is the primary reason why this country is in recession at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second difference between the policies of those on this side of the chamber and the policies of those on the opposite side is that, unlike the Government, we believe in effective and efficient regulations and legislation to cover dumping and countervailing. This Government likes to make lots of soothing noises about taking action to prevent dumping and countervailing, but it does not have the courage to do so. It was only as a result of the actions of Senator Boswell and my National Party colleagues that we got an effective inquiry into dumping and countervailing, but this Government still dismantles our trade barriers while doing nothing to ensure that goods that are subsidised from overseas are not allowed to flood these markets and destroy unprotected Australian industries. This will be the crux of one of the points I will be making today in respect of the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter, which does not significantly affect the Bills before the Senate today, is quarantine restrictions. I will, however, flag the fact that this Government, though it has been warned by those of us in the National Party time and time again, refuses to take the necessary steps to protect Australian primary industry from the threat of disease coming in from overseas, disease that runs the risk of devastating one primary industry after another. It was some six or eight months ago that I asked Senator Cook, as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, whether anything was going to be done about the threat of disease importation from bananas from overseas. Senator Cook replied to the effect that it was just another National Party form of protection. It does not take long before the wheel turns. It brings me no great sense of satisfaction to say that, within six to eight months of Senator Cook on behalf of the Government refusing to take adequate steps to prevent disease coming into this country, we have seen the devastation of the Australian pawpaw industry through the introduction of cucurbits to this country that brought with it ringspot infestation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth and equally significant difference between this Government's policies and the policies of those on this side of the chamber relates to the exchange rate. It is a fact that this exchange rate is still artificially high. It is artificially high because of the artificially high interest rates created by the discredited former Treasurer, Paul Keating, which have been maintained by his successor, Mr Kerin. That exchange rate costs Australian primary producers, Australian manufacturers and, most importantly, Australian workers billions and billions of dollars every year. But this Government has done nothing to change its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in addressing the three Bills before the Senate today, we have to face the prospect that one day world trade will become more liberal, but the question we must decide today is what we are going to do in the interim. It is a fact that a tide of change is lapping the shores of this nation, just as a tide of change is lapping the shores of every continent around this world-a change in political circumstances, a change in economic circumstances and, hopefully, a change in trade. But at the moment the change in trade is still a long way off. We still have international competitors in South East Asia, in the Americas and in Europe that insist on subsidising inefficient farmers for political ends; yet this Government is allowing the produce of those subsidised nations to flood these shores and to destroy the livelihoods of Australian farmers, Australian small businessmen and Australian towns. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to direct many comments today to the sugar industry in my home State of Queensland, because the sugar industry in this country-and most of it is contained within Queensland-has earnings of some $1 billion. Every year 80 per cent of the crop of the Australian sugar industry is exported. This Government talks about creating an export mentality, yet it is single-handedly undermining one of Australia's great export earnings. Some 20 per cent of the crop in Queensland is committed on long term contracts, but those long term contracts are soon to expire. The question is: are we going to undermine a critical Australian export industry at a time when it struggles to get new export contracts in a corrupt world market, or are we going to say, as we on this side of the chamber do, that what this Government has done in breaking not only its promise to the sugar industry but the Parliament's promise to that industry is unsatisfactory?</PARA>
<PARA> The 1990 season has seen severe crop losses in Queensland as a result of the wet weather. It is expected that the new crop will be in the vicinity of 23.93 million tonnes. That, combined with lower world prices, has led to a reduction in the income of the sugar industry of some $200m-a 20 per cent reduction. That reduction in income would have been greater were it not for the fact that the sugar industry has embarked upon a process of rapid and aggressive expansion in the level of production. But there is a problem because in the process of expansion the industry has necessarily incurred costs-long term costs which it will be able to pay off if it is not undermined by deliberate changes in government policy. That is what we are facing. If this Government is to have any credibility in talking about how we need to encourage an export industry, it is necessary for it to have a sympathetic attitude to Australian sugar farmers who are trying to expand their industry and meet the Government's calls for increasing levels of export, yet the Government does nothing of the sort. It has decided, without consultation with the sugar industry, in breach of its promise and, most importantly, in breach of the Parliament's promise, to cut the level of tariffs on sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons that Senator Button gave for this cut in the level of tariffs on sugar was that it would improve the processing costs of downstream industries, but the fact is that the price of sugar is but a small component of the costs of processing industries in this nation. I take as an example SPC Ltd, a cannery which uses a large amount of sugar in the preservation of the fruit which it cans for Australia's markets and for export markets around the world. As a result of improvements in industrial relations, SPC had an improvement in productivity of some 48 per cent. Those sorts of productivity gains are available to not hundreds but thousands of businesses around this country, big and small, if this Government has the courage to deregulate the labour market, if it has the courage to allow a change in industrial relations that will create millions of jobs around this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government does not have the courage to do it. In sitting back on its hands, it has allowed the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians to be sacrificed upon the alter of its failed economic policies. It has allowed the job prospects of hundreds of thousands of young Australians to be destroyed for years because it will not make the right decisions, because it is too far in bed with its union mates to see the importance of the necessary economic changes in areas such as industrial relations. If Senator Button really is interested in improving the productivity and the profitability of the Australian preserving and processing industries, why does he not start where the rot is worst-with our industrial relations policies, which do not improve the productivity of Australian industry but take jobs away from Australian workers?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that we must consider in the reduction of tariffs in the sugar industry is the rate of tariffs in other countries. Senator Button in March tried to tell this Senate that the Australian sugar industry-this is a great one!-is highly protected compared with our international rivals. That, of course, is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the tariff schedule that was first put in place in 1988, I understand that the ad valorem rate of tariff-and the ad valorem rate is a big deception-was something in the vicinity of 35 per cent from 1989-90 and 28 per cent from 1990-91. At the same time, the European Community and France had an effective subsidy on sugar production of $551 a tonne, compared with the rate until July this year of $115 a tonne in Australia. In effect, the European Community is giving a subsidy of 214 per cent of the world price. Thailand, one of our South East Asian competitors, has an effective subsidy of $446 a tonne, or 173 per cent of the world price, and the United States has an effective subsidy of $357, 138 per cent of the world price. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has the audacity to say that a subsidy rate of $95 a tonne is excessive. This Government, in the face of subsidies as high as $551 a tonne, has the audacity to come into this Parliament and say that an Australian industry which has a tariff of $95 a tonne is highly protected in international markets. This Australian sugar industry is one of the least protected sugar industries in the world. It is a sign that this Government, in its headlong charge to implement its policies, will do anything to sacrifice the truth. But these policies will bring nothing but ruin and despair to the Australian sugar industry and will without doubt show the Australian sugar industry that this Government is corrupt, morally, financially and in every other sense, because the Government is failing to do the right thing by Australian industries that are earning export dollars for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The great lie in the arguments that have been put forward by the Government is that this is an ad valorem tariff. Nothing could be further from the truth. In 1988, when this regime was put into place, it was intended that this would be a set rate tariff specifically because of the high volatility in international sugar prices. What happens? The international sugar price goes down and this Government says, `Goodness gracious, the ad valorem tariff rate is too high; we will have to cut the tariff as well'. The set rates of tariffs were put in place to allow the Australian sugar industry to become deregulated, to expand and to become competitive in international terms-to assist it over the hard times. What has this Government done when the hard times have come along? It has kicked away the props. It has kicked away any possibility that the Australian sugar industry might have had to get through those hard times. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard this Government talking about ad valorem tariffs when the tariffs were never meant to be ad valorem rates at all. This Government is very good with other people's money. It has been good with Mr Connell's money, Dallas Dempster's money, Mr Bond's money-and the money of goodness knows what other people. But I am concerned with what it is doing with canegrowers money.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is amusing that Senator Button should interject like that. He comes from the Australian Labor Party, the party of the big black briefcase, the party where Brian Burke can send his secretary down to the local bank and withdraw $300,000 in cash. The only problem was that the $300,000 did not come from his account. It certainly went into his account but we do not know what happened to it after that. Senator Button should not forget that there is a commission of inquiry into the malpractice of the Labor Party and its government in Western Australia, the Royal Commission into an Attempt to Bribe a Member of the House of Assembly and Other Matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I appreciate the humour of Senator Button-and obviously he has to be humorous to make a comment like that-I do not believe that his interjection has much relevance to this debate and I do not believe that it shows that he understands what is going on. We have seen a discredited Labor Government that is looking to attack one primary industry after another in an attempt to undermine the economic fortunes of this nation, in an attempt to divide the very people who are providing the basis of this country's potential economic recovery. That is why we are seeing this Government do what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a very specific case to show how this Government's policies have made primary industry sick. That is, of course, Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd. In May 1990, Bundaberg Sugar traded at $4.50 a share. At that time the price of sugar was approximately 15c to 16c a pound. Now the price is some 8c to 8 1/2c a pound. Prior to the Tate and Lyle bid for Bundaberg sugar, Bundaberg Sugar shares were trading at below $3.70 each. In other words, the reduction in world prices and the Government's announcement that it was going to reduce the tariff on the sugar industry have eroded the profitability of Bundaberg Sugar and the entire Australian sugar industry so much that we have seen incredible reductions in the value of the share price of Bundaberg Sugar, reductions of something like 20 per cent in its share price. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no coincidence that Tate and Lyle made its bid for Bundaberg Sugar shortly after this Government's much vaunted industry statement, an industry statement which this Government said would assist Australian industry and which instead has driven it into the arms of a foreign predator. Worse still, this foreign predator which is launching this hostile bid for an Australian controlled company makes its profits from European Community export restitution payments. Here we see a so-called Australian government ripping away the tariff on the sugar industry-a tariff which it asked this Parliament to promise to the Australian sugar industry. It is driving down the profitability of an Australian industry, driving down the share price of one of Queensland's best companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of Australia's best companies, as Senator Boswell says. Then the Government encourages this foreign competitor to come in with its European subsidies to gobble an Australian company. That is what Senator Button and the Government are doing-allowing a subsidised predator to come in and gobble an Australian company. Mr Kerin, as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, sat by and allowed these changes, these reductions in the tariff. Then, as Treasurer, having delivered the first cut as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin delivered the unkindest cut of all: he refused to say that this bid by a subsidised foreign predator was contrary to the national interest. He has given approval for this bid to go ahead. He has given approval for yet another Australian industry to fall into the hands of foreigners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not have anything against foreign investment per se, but it is very dubious whether anything good will come out of this bid. It is certainly the case that the profitability of Tate and Lyle comes from subsidies which are not available to Australian industry. That is why the moves and the actions of this Government are thoroughly reprehensible and that is why I do not believe it can have any credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the tortuous and unfortunate saga of the Australian sugar industry. It is yet another primary industry which this Government, through its deliberate actions, has managed to destroy. It is yet another industry where the hand of Mr Kerin has blackened the prospects of its members. The question is: should we as senators allow the promises of this Parliament to be broken? I do not care what promises those opposite may want to break as a government, but should we allow to be broken the promises of this Parliament that came out of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry into assistance for the sugar industry?</PARA>
<PARA> We have a major problem in Queensland with our sugar industry as a result of this Government's policies. I do not believe in good conscience that I can allow the promises of a Parliament to be broken for the vested interests of the Government, especially when the Government fails to do the other four things that are required to make liberalisation of international trade a reasonable prospect for this nation. I do not believe that this Government has any credibility when it talks about international trade, primary industry or manufacturing industry, or any industry of that kind. For these reasons, I will be supporting the amendments to be moved in the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as I said, I welcome the tide of change that laps the shores of every nation around this world today. However, I am concerned about the tidal wave of subsidised goods, the tidal wave of dumped and countervailed goods which is coming towards Australia at a great rate of knots. I do not believe in the face of this tidal wave of subsidy that we should take down the storm walls and allow Australian primary industry to be flooded with subsidised goods. For this reason, I have great pleasure in standing behind my National Party colleagues, Senator Boswell and Senator Bjelke-Petersen, in their stance on these Bills today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the restricted time today, I intend to confine my remarks on the three Bills before us-the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, the Bounty Legislation Bill and the Customs Amendment Bill-primarily to the Government's contemptuous disregard for the sugar industry and the effect that the Government's decision, announced in the March economic statement which is being put into effect by these Bills, will have on the sugar industry, an industry which I might add has directly provided my livelihood all my working life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of this legislation will mean a loss to the sugar industry conservatively estimated to be worth $16m in the 1991-92 year and $11m in the 1992-93 year. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has a record of broken promises, and Senator Bjelke-Petersen has listed them. I will just mention a few: there will be no capital gains tax; no child will live in poverty; and `I will serve my full three-year term as Prime Minister'. However, one might have expected that, when a government, as opposed to Labor politicians, makes a decision and a promise, it can be relied upon to honour those decisions and agreements. The whole fabric of government, business and, in fact, society falls down if a government makes decisions and commitments and then, after a very short period, unilaterally breaks those promises and commitments. This is what has happened in relation to the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, following the lifting of the embargo on sugar imports, it was recommended that a specific duty which would be triggered when world prices were less than 12c per pound would apply. There was some hesitation that such a recommendation might be illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, implemented a compromise solution whereby he directed that the tariff would be $115 per tonne from July 1989 up to 1 July 1991; $95 per tonne from 1 July this year; and $70 per tonne from 1 July 1992. In that three year period, the Industry Commission was to review the rate of protection that would apply to the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, without any warning or notice to the industry at all, this legislation reduces the tariff from the beginning of next month from $95 per tonne to $76 per tonne, and next year from $70 per tonne to $55 per tonne. Sugar farmers plant in April and May of one year and harvest in the September to December period of the next year. Their decisions on acreages, fertiliser, forward planning and budgeting therefore must be done 18 months in advance. For a government to allow an industry to proceed on the basis that it was receiving a guaranteed price of a certain amount, and then, without any consultation with the industry, unilaterally to change that overnight is incredible and shows the Government's complete lack of integrity when it comes to having any sort of feeling or sympathy with the small businessmen and farmers who are the backbone of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Why the rural industries continue to go around lauding and having some fascination for the efforts of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, is a mystery to me. All these anti-rural, anti-farmer pieces of legislation were initiated in his term as Minister. The Government's complete lack of feeling for those whose income depends upon their ability to produce is understandable when one considers that the country is run by a Prime Minister and a would-be Prime Minister who have never had to worry about a weekly income at any time in their life except to go around and pick up a fixed amount pay cheque from the pay office at the end of every week. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariffs were scheduled to come down in an ordered fashion, and I suspect that the rural industries believed that the Industry Commission would apply further reductions at the end of the agreed period. However, the industry had a chance not only to adjust and work out what was happening, but also to learn to live with the lower prices. </PARA>
<PARA> We agree with the general thrust of the Government's direction, but the Government seems incapable of understanding the other things that have to be done to benefit Australia. The Government has squandered the opportunity it had with the 12 March statement to create an environment which would allow real revitalisation of Australian industry, and we will be moving amendments condemning the Government for missing these opportunities. Our amendments call upon the Government for comprehensive labour market reform, genuine enterprise agreements, voluntary unionism, the abolition of security of tenure on the waterfront, the removal of cabotage on Australian coastal waters, and the introduction of a comprehensive goods and services tax which will abolish the current ramshackle wholesale sales tax and allow business inputs to be exempted and so boost export. </PARA>
<PARA> The rorts on the waterfront generally are legend in this country and bring about a situation where, because the Government has failed to do anything about real reform of the waterfront and coastal shipping or about domestic transfer costs, sugar can be landed in Sydney from Bangkok at the same freight rate as applies to sugar from Bundaberg. There have been spectacular successes where the labour market has been deregulated. One only has to look at Mudginberri, Dollar Sweets Co. Pty Ltd, the 48 per cent improvement in productivity at SPC Ltd over the past three months after an agreement with the employers, the Powers Brewing experiment, and the 400 per cent increase in productivity at Robe River. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government has slashed protection to all Australian industries but, at the same time, it has not given Australian industries the chance to compete with overseas competitors on the same terms as to transport, labour and telecommunications costs. The Customs Amendment Bill 1991 also gives effect to reform of Australia's anti-dumping mechanisms. Of particular interest to our primary producers is clause 7 of the legislation which amends the principal Act by facilitating the use of anti-dumping or countervailing arrangements by agricultural or horticultural industries affected by the dumping of processed agricultural goods. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the coalition will be moving an amendment calling on the Government to reduce the current three-tier investigation process to a two-tier one-that is, a 55-day preliminary investigation period after which provisional measures can be imposed, followed by a single 120-day investigation stage. It is clear from the feedback that I get from all over my State that the rural producers are again suffering because of the corrupt world trading regime, sugar being perhaps one of the most notorious cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian sugar industry is the most efficient sugar industry in the world, but how can it possibly compete with producers from other parts of the world who are very highly subsidised? France subsidises its domestic price for sugar to the extent of $551 per metric tonne; Thailand, $446 per tonne; and the United States of America, $356 per tonne. This might be compared with the subsidy that the reduced tariffs will give to the Australian sugar industry of $55 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worse when we consider that Thailand, which is one of our principal competitors, also enjoys developing country preferential trade status in Australia. Put another way, the Australian subsidy is about 28 per cent; the United States subsidy about 138 per cent; Thailand, 173 per cent; and France, 214 per cent. How can Australian industries possibly compete in that sort of a market? When addressing the Queensland canegrowers conference earlier this year, Mr Lindsay Hall, the Chairman of the Queensland Farmers Federation, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Farmers have no problems with the lowering of tariffs and freeing of trade. What they don't think is reasonable is for this to be undertaken in isolation from the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be made clear to the rural community that it is the current Australian Labor Party Government and Mr Kerin who have reneged on their promises regarding the fixed rate of tariffs to apply from 1 July this year, and have refused to deliver the corresponding micro-economic reforms that would, to a certain extent, have made the tariff reductions much more bearable. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be doing all that I can to ensure that the best interests of the sugar industry are enhanced and that we keep industry requirements under review. Solutions will have to be found to provide safeguards for the Australian sugar industry when world market prices are cripplingly low because of the corrupt practices of governments in countries which compete directly with us on world markets. There is no sense in wiping off the map an efficient Australian industry if governments in the European Community, the United States and Thailand do not respond to Australia's lead in attempting to make the world sugar market free and more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> If nothing is done overseas to rationalise world sugar markets, and subsidies and protection that other countries give to their industries, there may come a day when Australia will have to look again at the whole question. I intend to maintain my close connection with the sugar industry so that that industry can have a credible voice in the next government. Short term political actions that only provide ammunition for the Australian Labor Party to cling desperately to power do not interest me. </PARA>
<PARA> The duplicity of the Australian Democrats' actions in this debate is shown by their continuing anti-rural stand. I mention the wool debate, where the Democrats held the line for a little while and made sure for a few days at least that farmers in rural Australia would have a low tax. However, I understand from reading the newspaper that they are about to be bought off, that they are not going to hold the line and that they are going to tax the rural community more and more. </PARA>
<PARA> While speaking of the wool debate, I should pay tribute to and congratulate the eight Liberal and four National Party senators who supported that debate and very skilfully achieved the result that woolgrowers wanted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw to the attention of the Senate a number of matters relating to the wool industry and the debate that occurred the other night. I also wish to acknowledge and put on the public record a number of faxed petitions that I have received from growers around Australia, particularly from my State of Western Australia. Because of the difficulty of distance, particularly in our pastoral areas, these petitions have travelled from property to property by fax, so they are not in the prescribed form and cannot be presented in this place as such. Nonetheless, I have received some 2,000 signatures that have been recorded on faxes throughout the State of Western Australia. They represent approximately 25 per cent of all woolgrowers in my State. I want to put that on the public record and to thank those people for the interest they have shown in the current debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will read a number of the messages I have received from them. Obviously, one cannot read all the messages, but it is worth looking at some of them. A fax from Ethel Creek in Newman says:</PARA>
<PARA>For the future of the wool industry, we, the undersigned, demand the House of Representatives levy the woolgrower no more than 10 per cent wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA>One from the Gindalbie Pastoral Company in Kalgoorlie says:</PARA>
<PARA>For woolgrowing to survive in the semi-arid pastoral country, it is critical that the wool tax be no higher than 10 per cent. We have no alternative source of income, so earnestly request that you use your influence on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA>And one from Carnarvon says:</PARA>
<PARA>In the future interests of a viable wool industry and its survival, we, the undersigned, demand that the House of Representatives levy woolgrowers no more than a 10 per cent wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a host of these messages. I want to put some of them on the public record so as to acknowledge the position and, hopefully, have the Government recognise the importance of the level of tax to the survival of many people in the wool industry in my State. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to take the opportunity to refer to a couple of things which were said the other night in the heat of the debate and which, in all fairness, need to be put correctly on the table. In doing so I am not intending to have a shot at anybody, but I think the record should be absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer particularly to my having been misrepresented by Senator Bolkus, regarding figures I presented to this chamber, when he claimed that I was averaging figures out and started to quote me. I interjected and he pulled off it. I want to make it quite clear that the figures I gave to this chamber the other night in terms of the saving to growers were that for every 1,000 sheep the difference between a 15 per cent and a 10 per cent tax was $750. I also stated that producers, or anybody, could do their own figures from that aspect of it. I was not trying to present a case in terms of the average, because there is no such thing as an average woolgrower or an average producer-it just does not work like that. But when you start looking at the bone fide wool producers-I am talking about those people who receive more than 70 per cent of their income from wool-then the figures go up quite significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise another point in order to put the record absolutely straight. Here one has to be critical of the Department in terms of what was done here the other night, when I asked Senator Bolkus whether he would put on the table the figures that had been used or how the calculations of the government figures had been reached, and there was tabled in this place the ACIL submission of May, from which it was said the figures that were worked from had come. It was quoted, against the claim of a number of us on this side of the chamber, when we said that the latest ACIL figures showed that a tax of 9.25 per cent was sufficient in the first year. That ACIL submission of May was not the latest submission. In fact, the submission from which we were quoting was dated June 1991. I request the Government to update its information. </PARA>
<PARA> I re-emphasise this point. The situation has changed very significantly since the Vines report was brought down. I refer in particular to the fact that the price of wool has been significantly better than anticipated. In fact, it went over 600c just yesterday. As a comparison, the Government, which I have no doubt has been using Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) figures as well, was predicting at the time the reserve price scheme was abolished that the price for wool would be 300c a kilo. So the current market price is double the Government's prediction back in about January of this year. I note that very recently ABARE has adjusted its figures back up to 475c, which once again changes the scenario very significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I draw the attention of this chamber to the fact that I have received petitions from approximately 25 per cent of the wool growers in Western Australia and to acknowledge the fact that they are taking a very keen interest in this debate. It is imperative that the Government examines our figures very closely, looks carefully at the latest ACIL report, and accepts the decision of the Senate the other night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On numerous occasions I have risen in this place to expose the human and other faces of banking and of the rural crisis in Australia. I rise today to alert the Senate to the tragic circumstances of the Wilson family of Hopetoun in Victoria. The circumstances of the Wilson family are a classic case of Australian battlers and honest, hardworking Australian farmers. Today they bury their two-year-old son, Mathew. There is widespread anger at the Wilsons' experience of the last few months, particularly of the last few weeks, but in many respects, excepting for its tragic culmination last Monday and today, it is typical of what is happening across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will briefly outline the Wilsons' circumstances now and I will seek leave to table a fuller description which has been provided to me in the last 24 hours on their behalf by their legal representatives with supporting evidence. I am advised that there are no matters currently before the court in relation to what is contained in these documents. Matters have been before the court previously and judgments have been made, and those judgments are referred to in the documents that I will seek to table. I have previously circulated copies of the relevant documents to both sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wilsons' case goes back over a period of 20-odd years, but probably the most significant events have been in recent weeks. Mr Wilson was evicted from his farm by action of the Sheriff's Office on 29 May. That was only a few weeks ago. A party of 30 officers from the Sheriff's Office arrived on Wednesday, 29 May, and physically carried Mrs Wilson from her dwelling and placed her on the roadway, and they did likewise with all the Wilsons' possessions. Mr Wilson was not at home at the time. On Monday, 17 June, after the eviction, Barry's son Mathew, aged two, was with Barry on his tractor on the farm. The tractor was of a cabin variety. I understand the child leant against the door, which had not been properly closed, and fell out under the wheel of the moving tractor. Mathew was killed and his funeral is today. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter from the legal solicitor says:</PARA>
<PARA>The second event is a direct consequence of the first. Wilson's life was thrown into turmoil by the eviction. He has been terribly stressed, both psychologically and emotionally. I could not imagine this tragedy occurring in his life if his life had been running normally. </PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that the door had been damaged during the process of eviction and that Mr Wilson was not aware of the fact that the door was not functioning correctly when he placed young Mathew in the tractor before the tragedy occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I was approached by the Wilson family several weeks ago to intervene on their behalf in a last-ditch attempt to avoid the eviction from the property, so I was aware of the circumstances that had been building up. The Wilson's case is one of several hundred cases from the rural sector that I have been dealing with over the last two years or so. Indeed, it is one of about 600 cases that I have on my files. </PARA>
<PARA> The build-up to this set of circumstances is not untypical of what has occurred in rural Australia in recent times. Of course, I think we are all aware of the fact that farmers are financially vulnerable by virtue of the nature of what they are doing, the susceptibility to seasonal change and the like. There is an acknowledged financial vulnerability. That was accommodated for by what used to be called a rural bank. But rural banks sold out to the general banking process and the pursuit of profits. Nevertheless, the financial requirements of people in rural circumstances are peculiar to those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a period of years the Wilsons had made necessary financial arrangements through Westpac and the Rural Finance Corporation. They gave rise to financial difficulties in the mid-1980s. There was an attempt on the part of Mr Wilson himself to restructure those financial circumstances with the assistance of the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria, whose function specifically is to assist in those processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Westpac became involved in this process of restructuring. It is not unreasonable to say that eventually the financial difficulties became such that the bank walked away from him and left him in the hands of the Rural Finance Corporation. Mr Wilson put a series of restructuring propositions before the Corporation. They were all bluntly rejected, but no alternative strategies were devised for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The long and short of it is that, slowly but inexorably, as we have seen with so many rural families, the Wilsons found themselves moving towards financial disaster. As is so typical of the rural sector, the financial disaster often is, I believe and have argued in this place, of the making of their financiers. The obligation of those financiers to assist in the management of the financial circumstances is often abandoned. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it disconcerting that Senator Button has used the word `distasteful' when referring to the process in which I am now involved. I would have thought, since I am acting at the request of the family and its legal advisers and, I believe, in the public interest, that it was by no means a distasteful process. It could certainly be described as uncomfortable and distressing; I find it so. If I eventually seek and am given leave to table the documents, they will be a case history in themselves. I plead with those honourable senators who are now considering the documents to see them in their totality, because that is where their impact lies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might assist Senator Button if I were to now move to the matter of why I brought this to the attention of the Senate, rather than to a consideration of the details of the case. Injustice at the hands of financiers and so-called financial advisers is, as I say, quite widespread throughout rural Australia at the moment. It has given rise to enormous frustration and anger, and I would suggest to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and to the Leader of the Government (Senator Button), that it has given rise to a potential for violence. I also suggest that we have a responsibility to adopt all possible measures to avert those violent outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not brought this matter before the Senate lightly; nor have I previously brought these matters before the Senate lightly. About two months ago, a woman in Sydney advised me that she was going to take up arms and resist eviction from her property at the direction of a court order on behalf of a bank. I intervened on that occasion, spoke to the sheriff's office involved, and the woman was persuaded not to use arms in resisting eviction. </PARA>
<PARA> I am really building up to make the point that, as a result of visits to rural South Australia and New South Wales and soon to rural Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, I am convinced, on the one hand, that there is a need to build up pressure for action in resolving situations. I have previously raised with the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs the fact that people are not getting satisfaction through court and judicial processes. Often the outcome is to be evicted after having spent thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars in what are the due processes. Often the outcome is eviction by force. People who are experiencing and witnessing these processes are becoming frustrated, very angry and potentially violent. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable senators that the results of these tragic circumstances experienced by the Wilsons are such that intervention was required on the part of authorities to, hopefully, achieve just outcomes through more prudent, just, calm and compassionate approaches to resolving the problems that these people are experiencing. The problems are widespread and the frustration is absolutely enormous. In attempting to resolve this building frustration, I have appealed to those in authority over and over again in the best ways possible to me. That is the challenge with which we are confronted. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by this family that they will be seeking to place this matter before the public, for it to be a high profile matter and so that the public share their experience. I do not believe it is unreasonable of them, in view of the 20 years' experience they have had, to seek our cooperation in order to avoid recurrences of excessive use of force in evictions associated with actions resulting from court directions achieved by banks and other financiers. </PARA>
<PARA> Often it is impossible for people to fight these processes otherwise. I can tell the Senate that they are now going to do it increasingly in ways which are likely to be most unfortunate. I am simply putting out a plea to those who are responsible, to assist in avoiding what may be further tragic circumstances. My intention in raising this matter in this place at the request of the Wilson family and their legal representatives is no more than to alert those in authority, and the Australian community at large, that we have a huge challenge on our hands. It is one that we have to attend to very quickly and very compassionately. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I seek leave of the Senate to table the documents which I have previously circulated, admittedly only within the last few hours because I have only had them for that period. I seek leave to table them as a case study, as a substantiation of what I have been saying before the Senate and with the best assurances I can give that they do not bring into the Senate matters which are currently before courts. </PARA>

<PARA> The reason why really I do not grant leave is that on the first page of the letter sent by solicitors to Senator McLean there is an allegation about the circumstances-and indeed an allegation about almost the cause-of the tragic death of this young boy, Mathew, aged two. There is an allegation that the death was, in the terms of the letter, a `direct consequence of the eviction'. The circumstances surrounding that tragic death could well be the subject of a coronial inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about a matter that I raised in Question Time two days ago: Austrade and its reconstitution, the position that its current Chairman and Board hold and the need for the appointment of a new general manager. I want to relate my remarks today particularly to that part of Austrade which is to be split from Austrade as and from 1 September: that is, EFIC, the Export Finance Insurance Corporation. It is the part of Austrade which acts as an insurance company for overseas exports and also is in the business of making loans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to the debate that took place on 28 May last, in the committee stages of the Appropriations Bills. I was dealing with the question of a loan of $8m that had been made to one Mr Cantor, a gentleman who was found to have links with the Mafia and to have been charged in the United States with a serious offence concerning fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the Minister on a number of occasions to give me an undertaking that the Australian Government, through EFIC, would not continue to risk millions of dollars of taxpayers' money through loans that were being made by lending money to the likes of Mr Cantor. In other words, I was saying that I did not believe that their scrutiny process was good enough. I also pointed out that the $8m concerning the loan to Mr Cantor to build a boat worth $25m, which he presently has, was also the subject of another allocation of $8m through the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce. So through other methods of assistance the total amount paid to build Mr Cantor's boat was $16m. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular aspect that I raise is the assertion by Senator Button, in answer to my question about wasting taxpayers' money, that EFIC does not deal with taxpayers' money. He said, as reported at page 3693 of Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>First of all, the fundamental premise in this allegation is that we are talking about taxpayers' money. We are not. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important that the Senate and those who are interested in these matters become aware of the methods of funding Austrade and, in particular, EFIC. First of all, the amount of money that Austrade has to lend to individuals or corporations is money that it first raises on the ordinary market at certain rates and then it makes loans at particular rates which are very often below market rates. The Government subsidises those interest rates by giving an interest subsidy, that is, a payment straight out of Consolidated Revenue. It is very interesting to look at the figures as they were available as at 30 June 1990, and the sorts of amounts of money that Austrade, through EFIC, has in fact been dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA> Current export finance loans, which are ones where the capital is required to be repaid as well as interest, amount to $62.9m as at 30 June. Accounts which are non-current, that is, where there are only interest payments being made presently-such as the loan to Mr Cantor-stand at $639m. Of that $62.9m, $12.3m comes from the Commonwealth account, that is, taxpayers' money out of Consolidated Revenue. Of the $639m outstanding by way of non-current loans, $280m is by way of taxpayers' money by way of the Commonwealth account. </PARA>
<PARA> The borrowings that EFIC itself has managed to raise are $130m current and $1.108 billion non-current. Of this, EFIC itself borrowed $82.7m current and $820m non-current. Thus the Commonwealth, or the taxpayer, provided $55m current and $282m non-current. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly all these operations of Austrade, through this borrowing program, involve very much taxpayers' money at every turn. And, of course, there is the question of salaries and wages and office space that are all part of the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, on that occasion, Senator Button referred to the amount of money that was provided for the insurance of our wheat which is exported to Iraq and became particularly relevant at the time of the Gulf war. Indeed, when we passed Appropriation Bill No. 3 we had to provide moneys from Consolidated Revenue to meet payments to farmers for wheat which was not paid for by the purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA> Again there was a statement that this was part of a commercial exercise when that is clearly not so, that this risk was carried in the national interest and therefore on Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Now it is important to understand the mechanism by which EFIC makes a decision to accept or not accept a risk, that is, it judges it to be a commercial risk, and the way in which the risk is carried in the national interest on the Commonwealth account. The decision is simply made by the board. In this case that is the board of Austrade because EFIC and Austrade have been one and the same entity and have had the same board. So the board members make the decision as to whether or not they will accept a risk. </PARA>
<PARA> If they decide they cannot accept the risk they make a recommendation and the Minister then makes a decision. I cannot ascertain whether or not that decision is subject to a Cabinet decision, or whether the Minister has the power to make it himself. But that recommendation, if it is approved, is then dealt with in this way: a premium is paid which is the equal of the normal commercial premium, plus 25 per cent. The risk is then carried by the taxpayer on the Commonwealth account. The EFIC annual report of 1989-90 showed that the contingent risk on the Commonwealth account was $507m. So we can see that the risk that is carried by Consolidated Revenue, or in the national interest, is really quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I have raised these matters is that at a time of review and a time of restructuring of Austrade I think we have to pay particular attention to whether or not the splitting of EFIC away from Austrade is a sensible decision. Bear in mind that EFIC will remain with Senator Button as part of DITAC-the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce-and that Austrade will go to, I think, the man I call `that cool customer', Senator Evans, as part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. But, more particularly, it will be under the control of Dr Blewett. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are many questions that need to be asked about the restructuring. There are many questions that need to be asked about the delay that has been in existence in the appointing of a General Manager. I understand that Mr Ferris has made it known in the last 48 hours that he will not under any circumstances be an applicant for the position of General Manager. And I believe it is not acceptable in the whole sorry mess of Austrade to make Mr Lindsay MacAlister, the previous Managing Director of that operation, a scapegoat for an organisation which was at all times overseen by the board of Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are serious questions that need to be examined and I hope that my raising these matters today will begin a more timely process of asking questions so that we can effectively get a much more efficient Austrade body or assistance to our would be exporters and current exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wanted to raise relates to the question that I asked in the chamber yesterday about the meeting of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) with Mr Nelson Mandela. I asked whether the payment of the $83,000 to the African National Congress, a political organisation in a foreign country, was indeed a condition precedent upon Mr Mandela receiving Senator Evans. Senator Evans gave a lengthy reply concerning how the money was to be paid and went on to detail how the $2m was to be paid. He tabled a news release that he had put out on 11 June 1991. I attempted to move that the Senate take note of Senator Evans's answer, but I was not granted leave to do so. I did, however, manage to put one or two comments on the record by drawing to the Senate's attention the fact that Senator Evans had indeed misrepresented me in the course of his answer. I was able to address one or two points, but I think it is important today to draw the Senate's attention to that news release in some degree of detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing that comes from it is that the Minister purports to rely upon Professor Ross Garnaut's report to justify, in the way which is set out at the back of the news release, his payment of the $2m, that is, $83,000 in kind directly to the African National Congress and a further amount of $US188,000 for an institute of economic research at a selected university, to be established in consultation and by way of negotiation with the African National Congress. Clearly, this again is money which is tied to this political organisation in a foreign nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In reading in detail the comments that Senator Evans made, one is drawn to the conclusion that the Minister is equating the African National Congress with the democratic movement in South Africa. It was the democratic movement that Professor Garnaut was concerned to uphold. It was in general terms to all participants in that democratic movement that Professor Garnaut, according to the release itself, wished to see assistance given. At no time did he recommend it solely for the African National Congress, which the Government, by way of Senator Evans, seems to have picked as the body which will become the subsequent government in South Africa. It is abhorrent that we have a Foreign Minister who believes that he has the right to choose who will be the elected government after a democratic process in a foreign nation. But, as we heard yesterday, his record shows that he wishes to intervene in other people's democratic processes in places like India and in other nations and make judgments on them. If the world disagrees with him he abuses them, just as he abused the African nationals in South Africa. Indeed, he went to the extent of even using obscene language and throwing things at them. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House condemned Senator Evans in this place only a few days ago for his inability to choose the correct priorities for foreign policy and for his inability to conduct himself in a way which is suitable for a Foreign Minister. All I can say after reading this material further is that the things that we had to say in that debate the other day have been borne out. Indeed, if he had any decency at all he would clearly resign as the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Senate has a number of Bills to consider before two o'clock, so I intend to make my comments as brief as possible. I wish to raise the matter of the Warrama Living History Centre-a failed government exercise, or failed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) exercise, in the private sector. The Warrama Living History Centre was intended to be an Aboriginal tourist attraction on the northern beaches just north of the centre of Cairns. Unfortunately, the Warrama Living History Centre from day one has been an unfortunate exercise which has resulted in the loss of several hundred thousand dollars and potential losses far in excess of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this point I seek leave to table the report of the receivers and managers of the Warrama Living History Centre Pty Ltd as at 8 November 1990. I also seek leave to table the report of the liquidators of that company dated 4 June 1991. I note that these documents were shown to Senator Button previously when he was the Minister at the table. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I open my remarks by quoting one of the comments in the report of the receivers and managers:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Another aspect of the commentaries and studies we query is the attempt to create a large scale tourist attraction with resultant high wages and overheads from day one. A more prudent approach may have been to commence with a more modest operation providing an opportunity to expand as the market was developed. </PARA>
<PARA>How large was this business operation? At the height of its operation, which lasted for some three months only, Warrama Living History Centre employed 78 staff. The details are contained in the report, but I hasten to highlight some of the areas where people were employed. There were 20 people employed in entertainment and performing, 23 kitchen and bar staff and 12 gardeners. That is not necessarily a high level of staff, but one has to consider it by comparison with the number of people who went through the centre. For example, in the six days of November 1990 in which the Warrama Living History Centre was operating, it had total visitor numbers of 42 people. It had three visitors on 1 November, 29 on the second, none on the third, two on the fourth, none on the fifth and 10 on the sixth. The report gives details of the number of people who visited. At no stage did the visitor numbers at the centre ever exceed 215 in a day. There are many days, of course, when nobody attended, but there were still 78 people who were employed there. The receivers point out in the report that, as a result of this, to a very large extent the purposes of the restaurant and bar were to provide food and drink for staff at subsidised prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The company was put into receivership as a result of a court order in November last year. I understand, although I am not able to confirm this, that the court order was sought by ATSIC. It must be understood that in this matter ATSIC is a shareholder of the company; ATSIC holds 1,500 preference shares at a face value of $1,000 each. So ATSIC stands in there as a shareholder of the company. It also gave guarantees to various banks which lent money to the enterprise. It is my understanding that the total value of those guaranteed loans is about $596,555. So a lot of taxpayers' money has already gone to support this enterprise. ATSIC, however, decided that it was time to put it into receivership. The one problem is that $310,577 is owed to unsecured creditors in the Cairns area. Those creditors are listed in the report prepared by the receivers and managers. </PARA>
<PARA> We find, however, that there is a major problem. ATSIC signed a contract under seal to transfer title to the land, which had been bought by ATSIC's predecessor, to the company. In other words, the land on which the company was operating is owned by ATSIC, but ATSIC had signed a contract to hand this land over to the company. ATSIC, according to the report of the liquidators, now refuses to do so. The consequence is that this land will no longer be available to meet the claims of unsecured creditors. That means, of course, that the unsecured creditors are going to dip out in a fairly substantial way. It is suggested in this report that the amount paid to unsecured creditors may be as little as 4c in the dollar. It is said that if ATSIC waives its priority claim for the guarantee money that it has to cough up, that will rise to only 11c in the dollar. The key, therefore, is whether ATSIC in fact hands over the land, which it agreed under contract that it would do. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the liquidator says that ATSIC is now suggesting that the sale contract is invalid-for what reason I am unsure-and therefore it is not bound to transfer title to the company or its liquidator. The liquidator, according to this report, has sought independent legal advice in order to clarify the extent to which assets rightly belong to the company and are available to meet claims of the creditors. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Messrs Seymour Nulty advise that whilst the matter is complex, the company may have a valid claim in order to enforce the contract of sale, thereby obtaining the title to the land. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, there is one little problem. In the State of Queensland, when a matter of this nature is brought before the Supreme Court and the plaintiff is a company which is in liquidation, the defendant is entitled to claim that the plaintiff provides what is called security for costs. In other words, if the liquidator and the creditors are going to sue ATSIC to get the land, to get their money back, they have to cough up their money in advance. The report of the liquidator shows that the legal costs are expected to be in the vicinity of $70,000. In other words, these people are going to have to cough up almost 25 per cent of what they are already owed just to try to get some of their money back. </PARA>
<PARA> That is fine for ATSIC because ATSIC is having its legal expenses paid by the Commonwealth, from the taxpayers' money, but here are these poor people who have lost a total of $310,000 and they are trying to ensure that they get the assets to which the company is entitled; ATSIC is relying upon some sort of technicality in the law and is saying, `You can sue us, but we are going to fight you all the way. We are going to use the taxpayers' money to fight you'; and there is a very real prospect that ATSIC will insist on the creditors coughing up the legal expenses before they even get into court, by insisting on the creditors providing security for costs. If that is the case, it will be a classic example of bloody-mindedness by a government entity. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is rather ironic, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Senate is currently conducting an inquiry into the cost of justice, into the high cost of legal fees, yet we find a government entity using the cost of justice to prevent the unsecured creditors of the company from having access to the land which ATSIC had freely agreed to transfer to the company. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to go much further in delving into the matter because it could be the subject of legal action, but what I do say is that, if ATSIC is going to be bloody-minded about this solely on a technicality, it is highly unsatisfactory. It shows that entities such as ATSIC have run out of control. They have no sense of reasonableness or accountability. The $70,000, or however much it cost ATSIC to run this legal action, is money that it could be better spending elsewhere. The $1 1/2m of share money was money that could have been spent elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> While we have a high rate of Aborigines suffering from nutritional disease, while we have Aborigines who suffer from having poor educational and living standards, to see money spent like this is an absolute disgrace. The fact that in three months of operation this enterprise had total receipts of only $48,890 yet losses of $287,000 just on its operations shows that there is no reality in the way ATSIC has invested in this. I am gravely concerned, Mr Acting Deputy President, that an injustice will be done if ATSIC uses its superior position in the courts because it is funded by the Government to bludgeon the unsecured creditors into submission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to discuss Australia's industrial relations future, with particular reference to the policies of the Australian Democrats. Honourable senators will recall that some three or four weeks ago in Question Time Senator Sherry drew our attention to the continuing pressure by Senator McLean to force the Government to legislate for what he calls the right to strike. An examination of what Senator McLean is proposing shows that it has little to do with the right to strike. Australians already have a right to strike, which is exercised far too regularly, to which any observer of our industrial relations scene will attest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Senator McLean is about is entrenching union power and privilege. Make no mistake: what Senator McLean wants to do is to remove restraints on militant actions by union leaders. The effect of Senator McLean's policies is to enable unions to call strikes, often at minimal cost and risk to themselves, which can inflict massive costs on employers, their employees and the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to examine today the reasons why Senator McLean has put forward his astonishing proposal to remove effective barriers to the wrecking behaviour of militant union bosses. Why has Senator McLean reversed the traditional approach of the Australian Democrats, which has been to support the rights of small business against powerful unions?</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should recall that the Australian Democrats have traditionally been bitterly critical of the links between trade unions and the ALP. The Democrats' policy speech in 1983, for example, included this reference:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party and the trade union movement are by definition, inseparable. With these intractable vested interests there's no way either of these parties can `bring Australia together' . . . would you feel contented to have that power transferred to Bob Hawke, knowing the extravagancies of the trade union movement could be ruthlessly impacted on him.</PARA>
<PARA>How right, Senator Sherry, former Senator Don Chipp was-how right he was! The Hawke Government has probably kept one of its major promises, I certainly concede that. That promise was to the trade union movement. That promise was to protect and promote the power of trade unions through legislation, government administrative action and government grants. There is no question that Bob Hawke kept that promise. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984, I remind the Senate, the Democrats joined with the coalition to prevent the Government from repealing sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act. Some of our newer Democrats senators may not recall this, but as recently as 1986 enterprise bargaining formed an important part of the Democrats' industrial relations policy. In 1986 Senator Siddons, the then industrial relations spokesperson for the Democrats, introduced a private member's Bill which, to quote from the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . offers a practical alternative to centralised wage fixing. It puts in place a voluntary collective bargaining mechanism alongside the present conciliation . . . framework. It gives a clear alternative to wage fixing while keeping in place the centralised wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA>The civil courts would have a central role in this industrial relations system in enforcing contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the advent of Senator McLean, the Australian Democrats were strong supporters of voluntary trade unionism, enterprise agreements outside the centralised wage fixing system, the use of common law torts in industrial disputes and the banning of secondary boycotts. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years the Democrats' commitment to each of these policies has been significantly weakened. Senator McLean, as far as I can see-and I have gone through quite a number of the statements that Senator McLean has made on this issue-has stated five reasons for proposing this major shift in Australian Democrats policy. I wish to examine briefly each of these reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The first reason offered by Senator McLean for a change in the Democrats' industrial relations policy is that 45D `must be set in the contemporary situation' rather than `the environment in which it was framed in the 1980s by the Fraser Government'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Its drafting was a fairly frantic action by the Fraser Government with the intention of emasculating the unions. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are strong words. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It projected the impression, and was built upon the assumption, that all industrial action is irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement alone has three errors. Firstly, section 45D was not framed in the 1980s. It was inserted in May 1977. Secondly, the clause was the result of considered recommendations of the Swanson committee, not, as Senator McLean says, an invention by the Fraser Government. Thirdly, Senator McLean assumes that the section was introduced with the intention of emasculating the unions. The intention was to protect independent business men and women from capricious union action. As John Howard pointed out at the time, secondary boycotts had been used by some trade unions to dictate business arrangements which, among other things, had resulted in higher prices for consumers. The need for section 45E, I remind Senator McLean, arose when the Transport Workers Union combined with Amoco to cut off petrol supplies to Leon Laidley, a wholesale petrol distributor. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason put forward by Senator McLean, and this time it was in December 1989, was that the right to strike Bill was in response `to the growing unease and confusion that is being felt within the Australian community following the recent common law decisions on the right to strike'. No evidence was put forward to support Senator McLean's contention about `the growing unease and confusion'. I have not received even one letter from a constituent complaining about sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act. I suspect that you have not received any complaints, Mr Acting Deputy President. </PARA>

I dare say that no-one in this chamber can easily recall one letter that he has received from a rank and file unionist complaining about these sections. I concede that there is considerable unease-indeed outright opposition-among trade union leaders over the effectiveness of common law and the actions of the Trade Practices Act in tackling capricious union actions. There is no question about that great unease amongst the union leadership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Attitudes to trade union power by those who describe themselves as Australian Democrats seem to contradict Senator McLean's industrial relations initiatives. A recent survey undertaken by the School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University, amongst other things, asked: do you think that trade unions in this country have too much or too little power? Only 4 per cent of Australian Democrats voters thought that Australian trade unions had too little power. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Significantly, Australian Democrats voters want stronger protection against militant unions, not the weaker protection of the type proposed by Senator McLean. Let me say that it was a far larger sample than the example that was quoted by Senator Gareth Evans in Question Time two days ago about the support for the African National Congress. I make that point to Senator McMullan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third reason stated by Senator McLean, this time in a recent Bulletin article, was that legislation had to recognise that industrial action can be responsible. He argued that common law torts in section 45d had been what he described as a `big gun held to the head of unionists'. Again, no evidence was put forward by Senator McLean to sustain his argument that there is a new community move towards strikers. </PARA>
<PARA> Unions which behave responsibly do not send businesses to the wall. They do not deny essential services to the community. They do not destroy the businesses of suppliers and others associated with the target of a strike. That is what I would have thought responsible unionism was about. Of course, unions that do not act in this way, as I will show, are most unlikely to attract common law actions and the use of 45d and 45e. Let us face it, if these actions have been a big gun held at the head of trade union leaders or anybody else who wants to take industrial action, this has in no way cowed the union bosses. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the protections afforded in common law, Australia has a comparatively high rate of industrial disputes. This is a curse-Senator McMullan looks curious-in an environment where trade unions are, to quote the immortal words of President Ferguson of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, `part and parcel of the government' and common law actions have been available to employers. It is worth recording the fact that the most significant common law actions have been taken by small businesses facing large, radical unions. The fourth reason stated by Senator McLean is that there is a moral imperative in certain circumstances for people to withdraw their labour. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>They can be morally obliged to do so because of circumstances. Now, in doing so, they must be free of an automatic liability under common law or torts because it happens to affect somebody else down the line. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a somewhat callous statement. In this statement Senator McLean is misstating how the law operates. Employers are free to withdraw their labour, employees are free to withdraw their labour on proper notice without any liability. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean fails to point out the vital fact that no rank and file trade union member in Australia-and this is an important point-has been sued, gaoled or fined for striking, not one. In fact, the number of cases in which unions have had to pay damages during the 1980s can probably be counted on my fingers. </PARA>
<PARA> Union leaders and their organisations, however, are liable if they induce people to break contracts. As Peter Costello, our distinguished shadow Minister for corporate law reform and consumer affairs, has pointed out--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sherry" NAMEID="ZW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator Sherry</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Excellent. I am sure that Peter Costello will enjoy that comment from you. I quote him:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Unions which induce employees to withdraw their labour (if they would not otherwise freely choose to do so) run the risk of civil liability. This liability is rarely incurred. The individual has freedom to strike. Others are not free to induce the individual to act in a way which he or she would not voluntarily choose. Other citizens, businesses, employers, are subject to the same limitation. They may not induce others to breach contracts. The law protects freedom of contract and the right to have a contract performed. </PARA>
<PARA>Do unionists feel they have the right to strike? Over 1,000 strikes have occurred during 1990 and very few have occasioned common law actions. Senator McLean does not understand that even where it would be possible to bring unions before civil courts, employers typically prefer to negotiate rather than to sue. Certainly sections 45d and 45e and industrial torts have been useful in bringing about a resolution of some conflicts. By weakening or abolishing these actions Senator McLean will encourage more industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The final reason stated by Senator McLean is what he calls the `spreading incidence of actions taken under section 45d outside the trade union context'. He cited actions between footballers and football administrators and others relating to school closures and conservation groups. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not correct to say that section 45d has been used in football club disputes and school closures. In view of the claims by Senator McLean, I have had this statement carefully checked and there do not appear to be any such cases. There was a case relating to football clubs taken under section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the BHP case, the action under 45d related to threats to life and property taken by the Greenpeace boat. Interestingly, this type of action would still be liable under the McLean right to strike Bill. BHP did not proceed with the action. The company argued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Greenpeace has a right to highlight environmental concerns but it has no right to endanger lives and damage property. </PARA>
<PARA>The five reasons put forward by Senator McLean to justify his right to strike Bill are shown on closer analysis either to have been factually incorrect or misleading, or to distort historical and recent experiences. Not once in all the statements Senator McLean has made recently on this issue has he ever shown the slightest bit of concern for the rights of men and women who suffer as a result of capricious union action. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the employees of a company who do not want to strike? What about the supplier companies and their employees who are damaged by unions closing down a firm? What of the sometimes tens of thousands of people, men and women and children, who can be hugely inconvenienced by a major strike? Senator McLean has not said one word about their rights. Nothing in the numerous statements of Senator McLean indicates one little bit of concern about the costs of capricious strike actions in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean has brought into this chamber what he calls a right to strike Bill. He has urged the Government to take action. The Bill brought forward by Senator McLean and the sorts of actions he is proposing to the Government do not involve the right to strike-they are an invitation to strike, and on that basis I believe they will be rejected by the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put the Opposition's position in relation to each of these three Bills. The first is the Foreign Judgments Bill 1991. The coalition is not opposing this Bill which provides for the enforcement of foreign civil judgments in Australia. It is becoming more and more common for economic activity to reach beyond national borders. A corresponding need has arisen for nation states to pursue agreements with each other in order to provide for the enforcement of each other's civil judgments. Such agreements have recently been reached between Australia and the United Kingdom for the enforcement of inferior court money judgments and between Australia and New Zealand for the enforcement of non-money judgments and judgments for revenue debts. The agreement with the United Kingdom represents an interim measure designed to protect Australian interests in the United Kingdom from any harsh consequences that may flow from the operation of the common market convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia currently has a uniform scheme of State and Territory legislation, the basis of which is reciprocity, for the registration and enforcement of foreign civil money judgments. The uniform scheme is largely based on the United Kingdom's Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act of 1933 and modelled on the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance 1954 of the Australian Capital Territory. It provides for the direct execution of foreign civil money judgments. It does not depart greatly from the common law rules relating to the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing scheme, the countries and courts whose judgments may be registered are specified by way of regulation. In order to be registered the judgment must be that of a superior court, it must be final and conclusive between the parties, it must be for a sum of money and, at the date of the application, the judgment must be enforceable by execution in the foreign country and not wholly satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill replaces the existing State and Territory legislation. The basis of the scheme is reciprocity of treatment. The new legislation will be applied with respect to judgments of courts of a particular country specified by regulations where the Governor-General is satisfied that substantial reciprocity of treatment will be assured in relation to the enforcement in that country of Australian money judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the existing scheme, this Bill provides for the enforcement of civil money judgments of foreign superior courts. This Bill differs from the uniform scheme in that it also provides for the enforcement of judgments of foreign inferior courts where the foreign country provides reciprocal treatment for Australian judgments. In addition, it provides for the enforcement of foreign non-money judgments where there is reciprocity of treatment. As a result of the recent agreement with New Zealand reached in the context of the closer economic relations process, New Zealand revenue judgments will be able to be enforced in the same way as civil money judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Opposition is not opposing this Bill, we have a concern about the fact that the proposed legislation will operate to the exclusion of State and Territory law. The Opposition is usually wary of moves by the Commonwealth to enter a field in which it is the States which hitherto have had the power to legislate. I understand that you might be particularly of that view, Mr Deputy President. In this case, there is clearly an advantage in having one single piece of Federal legislation in that it will be easier to negotiate and implement arrangements with other countries for the enforcement of judgments on a reciprocal basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) said during the second reading debate on this Bill in the other place that the introduction of Commonwealth legislation in this area has received general support from State and Territory Ministers. The Opposition is concerned that this seems somewhat equivocal. The Commonwealth has also undertaken to consult with the States and Territories before entering into any arrangements with another country for the enforcement of civil judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General asked the Attorney-General during the second reading debate in the other place to explain the precise nature of the types of consultations the Government will carry out. The Attorney-General in reply assured the shadow Attorney that the Government had consulted with the States, although this does not address our concerns about the nature of future consultations. But, despite these concerns, the Opposition is not opposing this Bill as it will facilitate the process of negotiating and implementing arrangements with other countries for the reciprocal enforcement of civil judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also does not oppose the Proceeds of Crime Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 which amends the Crimes Act 1914, the Customs Act 1901, and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. The principal change introduced in this Bill is the establishment of a confiscated assets trust fund into which will be put funds recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act, the drug trafficking provisions of the Customs Act and section 9 of the Crimes Act 1914. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill further provides that the money collected in the Trust Fund is to be distributed equally to law enforcement agencies and to drug education and rehabilitation programs. The official trustee is to administer the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund is to be a trust account for the purposes of the Audit Act and the reporting provisions set out in the Act will therefore apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 19 of the Bill inserts new Part IIA in the Proceeds of Crime Act. In this new part the provisions relating to the Confiscated Assets Trust Fund are set out. New section 34A provides for the establishment of the Fund. New section 34B provides for payments into the Fund. New section 34C relates to payments out of the Trust Fund. Proposed section 34D provides for the distribution of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Under proposed section 34D(2) half of the net proceeds from the Trust Fund is to be distributed at the Attorney-General's discretion to law enforcement projects which are thought to enhance the detection, investigation or prosecution of major criminal activities. The other half of the distributable funds is to be distributed to drug education and drug rehabilitation programs at the discretion of the Minister for Health. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Opposition agrees that this concept of putting ill-gotten gains to productive use for the benefit of society as a whole is a worthy one, we have significant difficulty with one aspect of the proposal. These funds, because they are being paid into a trust fund and not into Consolidated Revenue, are not within the direct control of the Parliament. There is no specific accountability to the Parliament. There is a significant amount of money involved. It is expected that approximately $9m will be distributed through the Trust Fund in the next 3 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will confer very wide discretions on the Attorney and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) who will decide exactly how the funds will be expended. However, the Bill specifies no means by which those Ministers should or could inform the Parliament of these spending decisions. In other words, the discretions are basically unfettered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the view that those Ministers should be accountable for these expenditure decisions. It is proper, in our estimation, that the Parliament should have a greater role in monitoring the operation of the Act. For example, the Opposition has suggested that such decisions on the allocation of trust funds could be set out in written instruments which could be gazetted or tabled in both Houses of the Parliament, or even subject to disallowance or variation. The Opposition had previously given serious consideration to referring this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for detailed examination. The shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peacock, raised this problem during the second reading debate in the other place. As a result, discussions ensued between Mr Peacock and the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the outcome of those discussions is that Senator Tate-or someone on his behalf-will today be undertaking on behalf of both Ministers, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), that the Government will inform the Parliament of decisions made regarding the allocation of funds under section 34D by tabling a statement detailing all the agencies or programs selected to receive funding within 15 days of the decision being made. The Opposition is satisfied that this commitment will meet our concerns and that a referral to the Committee I mentioned would therefore not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is moving amendments to this Bill to add a definition of `prescribed officer' in relation to clauses 9, 15 and 17. These clauses make reference to certain obligations of the Attorney-General or a person authorised by the Attorney, including a power to direct that narcotic goods be disposed of. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee expressed the view that it might be appropriate to limit the persons or classes of person whom the Attorney could authorise. The Government's amendments add a definition of `prescribed officer' as `an officer in the Senior Executive Service'. This is a sensible solution and the Opposition supports these further amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is true the Opposition has, from time to time, expressed misgivings about some aspects of the Proceeds of Crime legislation, I would, on this occasion, like to emphasise that we support its aims and we support the measures introduced by this Bill today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer the Minister to reports of a speech by the United Nations Secretary-General in which he urged member nations to adopt next year an international convention on climate change. Is it correct that this convention aims to avoid the deleterious effects of global warming, possibly by stabilising and reducing harmful gas emissions, increasing energy efficiency and conserving forests? Can the Minister advise the Senate whether the Government has yet considered this convention and, if so, has any decision been made about whether or not the convention's adoption will have Australian support?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Negotiations for the framework convention on climate change, to which Senator Colston refers, which convention would contain appropriate commitments for actions to combat climate change and its adverse effects, began in Washington DC in February this year. The aim is to finalise the treaty for signature at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which is to be held in Brazil in June 1992. The second session of the negotiations have just commenced in Geneva, on 19 June, and they will continue until 28 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Agreement that the ultimate global objectives should be to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate was reached at the second world climate conference in November 1990 by Australia, along with 136 other countries. Energy efficiency was recognised as the most cost-effective immediate measure for reducing energy related carbon dioxide emissions and the reduction of deforestation and the protection and management of forests were seen as important measures to achieve this objective.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that the negotiations for a climate change convention are one of the highest priorities for international action to address global environmental problems. We put that sort of position on record as early as the Hague conference in March 1989, which I addressed. The Prime Minister also had some things to say in early 1990 to the effect that there is no greater global environmental concern than the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer. So we do strongly support this whole exercise.</PARA>
<PARA> We are working in the negotiations for international agreement to the Toronto target, so-called, on carbon dioxide emissions and that involves stabilisation of emissions by 2000 and a 20 per cent reduction by 2005 based on 1988 emission levels. We are also working on reductions of other greenhouse gases which are not controlled by the Montreal protocol as a global target.</PARA>
<PARA> A decision on whether or not the Government will adopt the convention-this is the final point, in response to the honourable senator's question-will depend on the outcome of these negotiations and the form and content of the text which emerges. At this stage, it is simply not possible to predict the final outcome. But it is obviously our hope that a substantive convention will emerge which meets our objectives and which can command broad international support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look, the Special Assistance Program for South Africans (SAPSA), formerly the Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN), has never been directed specifically to the ANC. In that context, AIDAB has had a clear view, as the Government has had, that in the context of development assistance moneys generally-and, indeed, for that matter, any other form of government money-it is not appropriate that money go to a political organisation. It is for that reason that the whole of the $15m over three years that was targeted for projects identified in consultation with the ANC did not involve money going directly to the ANC.

There has been no argument about that policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The $2m that has recently been the subject of an announced grant or an announced program over the next two years involves as to one small part of it, namely $83,000, an exception to what hitherto has been the generally adopted and agreed rule. This was not a program that was initiated from AIDAB. It is a program which, as I said yesterday, was initiated essentially by the Prime Minister, arising out of his conversations with Nelson Mandela and others and his view, which I share and the Government shares, that Australia can and should make a useful contribution to the capacity for economic analysis and planning of the opposition movement so as to put South Africa in a much better position so far as economic management strategies are concerned to cope with the new democracy.</PARA>
<PARA> It still has a development assistance rationale but it has got quite a different rationale from any previous, specific program that has been adopted under the SAPSA umbrella. As such, we considered carefully whether it was appropriate that one particular dimension of that particular program could legitimately, or should legitimately, involve, for the first time, some direct funds going to the ANC. We decided that in the particular context I have just mentioned, it was appropriate-namely, to establish the ANC department of economic planning.</PARA>
<PARA> The funds, as I think I said yesterday, are not being given by way of a blank cheque. They are being in fact given in the form of specific equipment. It is equipment that will be handed over in the form of a library, computers and office equipment of that kind. So I would be surprised if there were any recommendation in existence or comment in existence from AIDAB bearing specifically upon that particular component of that particular project money.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to an article in yesterday's Australian Financial Review by Michael Lynch which states that exports by the Australian automotive industry are expected to top the $1 billion mark through 1991 and the United States has displaced New Zealand as the biggest overseas sales market for Australian car and component manufacturers. Can the Minister inform the House of the export prospects in the remaining life of the current car plan and the likely impact on exports of the new industry arrangements which will replace the current plan when it expires in 1992?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the press report by Michael Lynch and others about exports from the automotive industry. The figures which the honourable senator refers to are based on a press release from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. It is noted by the Chamber that automotive exports are now moving towards parity with imports of automotive products, which is something fairly new in the Australian context. This is something which the industry and its work force can be justifiably proud of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1985, when the car plan began, the value of automotive exports was $442m. The Automotive Industry Authority reported that in 1990 exports reached $938.7m, which is a 112 per cent increase since 1985. Between 1989 and 1990 alone the increase was 44.7 per cent. The industry predicts that automotive exports will exceed $1 billion by the end of calendar year 1991, which puts the industry on track for a targeted export figure of $1.2 billion by the end of the current car plan in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jones in his question referred to the United States replacing New Zealand as the major destination for Australian exports. That is largely because of one manufactured vehicle. On the other hand, exports to Japan have grown very extensively in the form of automotive components. Those are the two major developing markets for the industry in respect of those two segments of it.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this growth in exports will continue under the arrangements announced in the 12 March industry statement. The point to be made about all that is that these increasing exports are a sign of the growing integration of the Australian motor vehicle industry into the world strategies of major automotive companies. That is something which has to take place. The small size of the Australian domestic car market and the way in which the international industry works make it imperative that Australia get into exports. It is an industry very dependent on volume of production both in terms of quality and costs, and exports become essential in that situation. All political parties should be concerned about those volume implications of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> We have to work, and we have worked, to get our industry integrated into the international one. If we had not done that we would not have had the promising outlook that exists for the industry at present. That fact was recognised in the original car plan. The export figures are a sign of that success and I am confident that exports by the motor vehicle industry will continue to rise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services. I refer to changes in last year's Budget which introduced a penalty deduction of two weeks payment of Austudy, in addition to non-payment of Austudy, for unexplained absences of more than five days in one term. Is the Minister aware that homeless students, for whom Austudy is the only source of income, are having payments reduced without warning or explanation? Does the Minister realise that homeless students have no parent or guardian available to write a note explaining their absence, or to take them to a doctor for a medical certificate? Does the Minister regard the two weeks penalty as particularly harsh in relation to homeless students who at least are making an effort to stay at school? Does the Minister realise that the unsupported lifestyle of homeless students often leads to the odd day away from school-to find a place to live, for instance, when living arrangements break down, or to collect emergency food vouchers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Coincidentally, I have a brief on the issue raised by Senator Bell. I am informed that students are satisfied that the Austudy homeless provisions are treated with special consideration due to their circumstances and that social workers are commonly used to assist departmental staff in processing them. I am informed that where the Department receives allegations concerning a homeless student the facts are ascertained very carefully before any action is taken to suspend payments. For example, a person may allege that a student is no longer at school and should not receive Austudy. This claim would be investigated thoroughly by contacting the school and the student.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department conducts regular enrolment and attendance checks of students on Austudy. These checks have the wide support of school systems. The attendance checks are primarily an incentive for students to remain at school rather than a punitive measure. If from these checks a school advises that a student has discontinued and there is no suggestion that the student is at another school, the allowance may be suspended to minimise the student's debt. In some cases a social worker is consulted. The school is responsible for advising whether it has approved a student's absence. The Department adjusts the Austudy payments based on this advice. If the student has good reasons for the absence from school, this is taken up directly with the school.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also informed that occasionally a student may have transferred to another school and failed to tell the Department. In these cases payments would be reinstated as soon as the client confirmed that he or she is still a student. If in these circumstances a homeless student is in financial difficulties, an emergency payment can be approved. I am informed that there are occasions where payments may be suspended without reference to the student or the school, as may happen when correspondence to the student is returned `addressee unknown'. It should be emphasised that this action would result from a student failing to meet his obligation to inform the Department of a change of address. I am asked to stress that the few homeless students whose payments are suspended, usually resulting from their own failure to advise of a new school or a new address, are treated very sympathetically by the Department and payments are reinstated urgently if they continue to be eligible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen those reports. The question asked of me is whether it is the market or the executives themselves which determine executive remuneration. In many cases, directors certainly vote themselves their own increases. For there to be a viable market, there needs to be a change between senior executive positions at a great rate. There is some shedding of executive positions, but in the present climate one cannot say that there is much turnover in the major companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Executive remuneration continues to rise in this country and it is certainly above the increases experienced by ordinary workers. In the year to February 1991, average weekly earnings rose by 6.9 per cent compared with a rise of 6.3 per cent in the year to February 1990. The average remuneration for directors of the top 23 companies continued to outstrip the rise in average weekly earnings by ordinary workers, although the increase was not as steep as experienced in 1989. Average remuneration for directors rose by 12 per cent in 1990 compared with 23.5 per cent in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures I have for comparison are of the 23 largest companies. The 25 largest companies, as determined by the Australian Stock Exchange based on their market capitalisation, includes two New Zealand companies whose reporting requirements are different from the Australian companies. Looking at the 23 largest companies in 1990 with Australian reporting requirements, despite the last two quarters experiencing negative economic growth, increases in executive remuneration bear little resemblance to the financial performance of our top companies.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1990, in the 23 largest Australian companies with the highest paid directors, 18 directors increased their remuneration by more than average weekly earnings. The largest rise in remuneration for the highest paid director was for the Managing Director of Adelaide Steamship Co., whose remuneration rose by $430,000, or 56 per cent, in 1990 to reach $1.2m. I point out that the group that this Managing Director presided over is now in debt of around $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> Other large increases occurred for the highest paid directors of the following companies: National Australia Bank Ltd, a rise of $200,000 or 32 per cent; Pacific Dunlop Ltd, up $190,000 or 49 per cent; and Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd, up $190,000 or 37 per cent. News Corporation Ltd continued to have the highest paid director. His remuneration actually did fall from $12.9m in 1989 to $12.7m in 1990. Average remuneration for each of the 10 highest paid executives in the largest 23 companies rose by 14.6 per cent in 1990, compared with a rise of 16.2 per cent in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> I have commissioned a research project which will look at the determinants of executive remuneration in Australia so that there can be a better understanding of how their rates are set and so the Government can be better positioned and advised as to whether it should take action and, if so, what action it can take about it.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my answer by saying that it is instructive that the Opposition should feel constrained to interject in the course of my answer and try to distract me from it. The importance of the interjection will not be lost on workers in this country who are being asked to bear the brunt of restraint and often are being prosecuted by the Opposition about their wage claims. It seems that the Opposition feels constrained to simply defend executive remuneration. The Government's position is that, where restraint is called for, it should be equitable across-the-board and no group of employees, directors or managers is exempt from that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the honourable senator want Senator Tambling to hear the answer or not? In May 1990, the Western Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Dr Judyth Watson, gave consent under section 18(3) of the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act for Dominion Mining to develop a mine at Yakabindie. This decision was based on recommendations of the Western Australian Museum's Aboriginal cultural materials committee which had studied the report of a survey for Aboriginal sites undertaken on behalf of Dominion Mining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This original survey of the area around the proposed development found a number of archaeological sites of low significance. It also identified two nearby known significant cultural sites which were avoided in the development planning. In October 1990, Ngalia Heritage Research Council, representing local Aboriginals, made it known that it was not happy with the original survey as it was felt that there had been limited consultation. The Council requested a supplementary survey. This was eventually agreed to by Dominion Mining and was recently carried out. Dominion Mining suspended further work in the area pending the result of the survey. The findings of this survey, which appears to have consulted a wide range of Aboriginal people, are that the whole area of intended mining development at Yakabindie contains a number of significant sites, particularly Joans Creek which runs through the middle of the project.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has recently received an application made under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 for protection of Aboriginal sites in the area of the proposed project.

It is true, as Senator Schacht pointed out-and this shows almost a degree of prescience on his behalf-that a consortium of Australian companies announced at the Paris Air Show their intention to cooperate in the development program with a view to establishing an Australian satellite launching facility at Woomera. The consortium is headed by British Aerospace Australia, and includes Auspace and Hawker de Havilland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed facility would be capable of launching light satellites-that is, up to 1,000 kilograms-into low Earth orbit. It would be complementary to the proposed Cape York spaceport but, indeed, performing a very different function. A proposal submitted by the consortium to the Australian Space Board seeking financial support for the initial design studies was considered favourably by the Board yesterday. The Space Board sees merit in the proposal and will talk with the consortium about the extended financial support which might be provided through the Australian Space Office. This project was originally referred to as the Australian launch vehicle program. That program was developed in the light of the so-called Motorola iridium project and was considered a serious contender. However, Motorola has deferred the choice of a maintenance launch supplier for a period of some two years.</PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence to support the proposition that there exists a growing market for such a space vehicle, quite apart from the Motorola business. An important development arising from the project is the fact that a team of Australian companies which normally have been rivals in various areas of space and aerospace technology has come together, welding an Australian industry competence into an internationally competitive entity. That is, of course, a very desirable target in an industry of this kind.

But, I repeat, in the longer term it is a very widely held view within the industry and elsewhere that here, as elsewhere, it makes more sense to value add, if you like, by doing the killing in Australia and creating additional employment in Australia, quite apart from avoiding all the rather nasty humanitarian implications that are associated very often with the long sea voyage for these animals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noticed Senator Panizza becoming suddenly alert when that question was asked. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has provided me with the following information. The aircraft was operating as Ansett Australia flight 161 from Sydney to Perth. At 1056 hours the pilot reported that the right engine thrust reversing system warning light had illuminated. The right engine was reduced to idle power and the descent of the aircraft was commenced, the aircraft being unable to maintain a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet on one engine. The aircraft was stabilised at lower altitude and the flight continued to Perth. Normal landing was carried out at 1210 hours local time. The nature of the fault has not yet been determined. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation is investigating the incident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be noted that the Ansett airbus fleet is equipped with different engines from those on the Lauda 767 which crashed in Thailand; that is, they are equipped with General Electric Snecma CFM56-type aircraft engines, compared with the Pratt and Whitney 4,000-series engines on the Lauda aircraft. The aircraft has since been flown back from Perth to Melbourne without passengers on board. The aircraft is effectively grounded while the problem is investigated by Ansett.

The fact is that those on low and fixed incomes will be in a perilous situation out in the marketplace with the imposition of a tax, whether it is 15 per cent, 12.5 per cent or whatever. Senator Loosley referred to the retail sector, and to have 12.5 per cent added to the purchase of food and beverages, medicines or drugs, would put an intolerable burden-a regressively imposed burden-on people which would require some sort of compensation. But certain costings have been done that show that the cost of compensating such people would amount to billions more than the additional indirect revenue raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to services, too, not merely goods out in the marketplace, when one looks at visits to the doctor, dentist or lawyer, or to the purchase of child care services, tourism and so on, one discovers that if a consumption tax is added to those services, quite clearly there will be a grave impact on the household expenditure patterns of people, particularly those on low incomes or on those who have retired on fixed incomes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The surprising thing about the article in the Sun-Herald to which Senator Zakharov has referred is that the phasing out of the class B widows pension has been going on since July 1987; it is hardly a new issue. In the last 12 months I do not think I have had a question on it, so I am surprised that it could suddenly be seen as anything new. The decision taken in July 1987 was an attempt to reflect a changed community attitude. It must be remembered that that widows pension was first introduced in 1942. I think the attitude towards the role of women in our society has changed pretty dramatically during the course of the last half a century. The Government recognised that in 1987 and set out to encourage women who finally had more time on their hands, as their children had moved on, to enter the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth has been that most of the women so affected have welcomed those initiatives. Specifically, those who are eligible for that pension now are widows aged 45 at 1 July 1987 who received a class A widows pension or supporting parent benefit, or who subsequently became eligible for one of those payments; women aged 50 or more on 1 July 1987; and women who, before 1 July 1987, were receiving a class B widows pension.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the numbers have gradually been going down. There were 83,500 women on that pension in June 1989, the number went down to 78,700 in June 1990 and to 74,700 this year. So the numbers have continued to decline. We all need to show some concern for women who have been out of the work force for often 30 years; they will find the transition difficult. I think, therefore, that we have to attempt even more to give them priority in the Newstart program. We shall certainly be doing that.

<PARA>Unfortunately, no statistics are available that indicate the number of business failures that were attributed by the owners to the effects of the pilots' strike.</PARA>
<PARA>A survey on the impact of the pilots' strike on Queensland conducted by the National Centre for Studies in Travel and Tourism and commissioned by the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation concluded that the pilots' strike had an extremely negative impact on Queensland's tourism industry. The estimated loss in direct visitor expenditure during the first 13 weeks of the pilots' strike was nearly $200m. Mackay, the Whitsundays, Townsville and Cairns were the most severely affected. Forward bookings in hotels/motels for December 1989 and January 1990 were down considerably compared with the previous year. The Australian Bureau of Statistics' figures for occupancy rates (the proportion of available room nights sold) for licensed hotels and motels etc confirm that Northern Queensland tourist centres recorded large falls in occupancy rates over this period.</PARA>
<PARA>Anecdotal evidence suggests that the pilots' strike was one of a number of factors to have had a detrimental impact on the North Queensland economy during 1989 and 1990.

I put that on the record for the sake of completeness.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator Knowles yesterday, I undertook to supply her with further information relating to three specific grants made through the Australian Embassy in Pretoria in 1989-90. I had assumed from her reference in the question to the grants being made through the embassy that the funds probably came from the direct assistance program-which is the small project aid fund administered by ambassadors generally around the world-rather than from the specific Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN). My checking has established that the grants were made under the SAPSAN program. The three projects mentioned by Senator Knowles primarily involve support for specific training activities and skills upgrading, predominantly for unemployed union members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the grant to the South African Black Hawkers and Informal Business Association-SABHIBA-this project involved the training of young blacks in basic business skills and technical training in the shoe repair business, and had a strong developmental focus, especially in view of the size and importance of the informal sector in the South African economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The grant to the Building Industry Workers Union of South Africa supported training courses for shop stewards in legal and human rights issues. The grant to the National Union of Steel and Allied Workers project provided panel beating and spray painting equipment for a training workshop to upgrade the skills of unemployed union members and school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals for these projects were carefully appraised by staff at the Australian Embassy in Pretoria and were judged to fully meet SAPSAN program guidelines. Those guidelines were set out in full in my answer to question No. 639 from Mr Cobb in the House of Representatives. They require that grants meet program objectives including, for example, that they meet humanitarian needs caused by apartheid and help prepare disadvantaged South African inhabitants and refugees for the post-apartheid era.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting to that. Approval for each of these activities was given by the Australian Ambassador on the basis of a recommendation from staff. The Australian Embassy monitored the progress of individual projects through visits and regular meetings with officials and through the assessment of project reports. As noted in the SAPSAN review report, the post has been particularly conscious of the need for proper attention to financial management. Despite staffing constraints, the embassy has been assiduous in monitoring projects which provide good opportunities for projecting Australia's development in human rights concerns to ordinary South Africans. On the basis of reports available, I am advised that none of these grants have been allocated to purposes other than development assistance properly so defined.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to raise with you a matter in respect of Hansard reporting. Yesterday in Question Time I sought and obtained leave for the incorporation of a letter received by me from the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus. The reason for my seeking to incorporate that letter was to point out to the Senate that the Minister had attempted to mislead me in this Parliament by erasing crucial matters from that letter. I made the point of saying that the letter with the erasures clearly showed his clumsy and unsuccessful attempts at censorship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note on page 5002 of Hansard of 19 June that, when the letter which was incorporated was printed, the critical words that had been erased, in fact, were left out. They make a big difference to the letter itself. Mr President, I will give you the two points. The original letter said:</PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, with extensive media attention given to a number of issues which come within the Department's area of responsibility-</PARA>
<PARA>The following words were left out:</PARA>
<PARA>(viz contract administration, disclosure laws and political advertising)</PARA>
<PARA>Further, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>This increase-</PARA>
<PARA>the increase in spending on media monitoring-</PARA>
<PARA>is seen as temporary-</PARA>
<PARA>The following words were left out:</PARA>
<PARA>and directly related to concurrent media interest in several topical matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the point I raise with you is why those words were left out. I understand that it is not beyond the capabilities of Hansard to incorporate these words in the same way that it can incorporate graphs, or anything else. The intent of the incorporation of the letter was to show the total letter with the Minister's own handwriting crossing out the words that he did not want incorporated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On behalf of Senator Button, I present the Government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on the timeliness and quality of annual reports. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THE TIMELINESS AND QUALITY OF ANNUAL REPORTS</PARA>
<PARA>JUNE 1989</PARA>
<PARA>SCHEDULE OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND RESPONSES</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Departments of Finance and Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;), together should identify and remove any areas of unnecessary overlap between the requirements for departmental annual reports and explanatory notes. This review should not lead to any loss in public access to any item of information currently available in either annual reports or explanatory notes. Any removal of overlapping requirements should not involve a reduction in the scope of annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>Revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports were issued in early 1991 and include (at page 14) a section on Portfolio Program Performance Statements (formerly called Explanatory Notes) and annual reports, which was prepared after extensive consultation with departments and other agencies and which sets out the functions of Program Performance Statements and annual reports. There should be very little overlap between the two kinds of document, but the amount of information made available either in one kind or the other has not been reduced and the requirement that annual reports be prepared in such a way that they can be understood on their own has been retained. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The annual reporting guidelines for both departments and statutory authorities should be renamed `annual reporting requirements'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA) that `when it is procedurally convenient to do so, the Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports be renamed as Departmental Annual Reporting Requirements, or an equivalent title' (recommendation 4, Report 304, Guidelines for Departmental Annual Reports). </PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 25(7) of the Public Service Act 1922 requires that departmental annual reports be prepared in accordance with `guidelines' from time to time presented to the Parliament. The Government expects to introduce in the 1991 Budget sittings an amendment substituting for the reference to guidelines a reference to requirements. Once amended legislation comes into effect, the guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports will be renamed accordingly. Departments will continue to be reminded in letters from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;) each year that subsection 25(7) makes compliance mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA>When the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to issuing the new document under the heading Requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Urgent action should be taken by the Departments of Finance and Prime Minister and Cabinet to develop new draft annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities. The accountability role of annual reports should be the principal focus of the review. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that this recommendation has been supported by the Senate Standing Committee (SSC) on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee (May 1990, p.6). It notes, too, that the JCPA has recently reported following its inquiry into annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities. The task of co-ordinating work on the drafting of new requirements in relation to the annual reports of statutory authorities will involve consultation with a wide range of agencies, taking into account issues raised in submissions to the JCPA on the subject by PM&amp;, the Department of Finance and other agencies, the recommendations of the JCPA, and issues raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration (SSCFPA) in paragraph 3.36 of its own report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that the primary purpose of authorities in producing their annual reports should be to meet requirements in relation to accountability. The Government will continue its practice of considering recommendations and comments by parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA>4. The Government grant to RAIPA should be increased to something in the range of $12 000 to $15 000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that the Committee made its recommendation `Having regard to the value of the [annual reports awards] scheme' conducted by the ACT Division of RAIPA. The Government made a grant-in-aid of $5000 to the ACT Division for 1990-91. The grant was for the purpose of providing supplementary assistance towards general administrative costs, including costs associated with its annual reports awards scheme. The Government does not consider that a grant of $12 000 to $15 000 would have been warranted. </PARA>
<PARA>The ACT Division will have an opportunity to apply for another grant next year. </PARA>
<PARA>5. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet should maintain a register of non-statutory bodies (NSBs) containing specified data on all such bodies as proposed in the Committee's 1986 report. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the Government's response of 8 December 1987 to the report on NSBs referred to in the recommendation, information about NSBs has been required in annual reports either of NSBs themselves or of their parent bodies, as the respective Ministers decide. There is also a requirement that parent bodies, in their annual reports, list any NSBs which produce their own annual reports, showing to whom those reports are presented and whether they are tabled in the Parliament or made public in some other way. The result of these requirements has been that information about NSBs is made available but that there is recognition of the possibility it may be available in reports not presented to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Provided annual reports containing information about NSBs are tabled, the Parliament has easy access to all the information in them. To ensure this, the Government will now require information about NSBs to be provided in annual reports (their own or their parent bodies') which are presented to Ministers and the Parliament. This requirement should close off any possibility that information might not be readily available to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>It also underlines the accountability of NSBs to Ministers, in line with the Government's response of 8 December 1987 referred to above. However, while it is appropriate that Ministers and the Parliament should have information about NSBs, PM&amp; has no such monitoring role as would be implicit in a decision that it should maintain a central register. </PARA>
<PARA>As pointed out by the Prime Minister in a letter of 11 February 1988 to the Committee on the subject of a proposed central register, committees wishing to examine NSBs would need to consult a collection of annual reports anyway, whether or not a register existed. It is sensible to make annual reports the comprehensive source of information about NSBs. </PARA>
<PARA>It may, however, become possible for the Government to offer committees further assistance. PM&amp; is at present looking into ways of implementing the Government's announcement in its National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia (June 1989) that appointments of people in the EEO target groups to statutory and other government bodies would be monitored and that PM&amp; would introduce a computerised system to record the findings. It may be found that this computerised system will facilitate the production of lists of bodies, including NSBs, to which appointments are made. </PARA>
<PARA>If that should prove to be the case, the Government would consider making such lists available for committees to use for their own purposes. In the meantime, agencies will continue to be required to provide in their annual reports lists of all NSBs of which they are the parent bodies and to show in relation to each listed NSB whether information about it appears in the tabled annual report of the NSB itself or in that of its parent body. </PARA>
<PARA>6. A review of the scope and content of the annual reporting guidelines for departments should be undertaken by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in conjunction with the JCPA. </PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports have been reviewed, taking into account comments and recommendations of the JCPA and other parliamentary committees. Revised guidelines were presented to the Parliament in early 1991 after approval by the JCPA. </PARA>
<PARA>7. The current [departmental annual report] guidelines should be fully adhered to until they are revised after that review. </PARA>
<PARA>PM&amp; wrote to all departments in 1989 and 1990 about the need to comply with the 1987 guidelines as amended. Compliance is a requirement under the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA>8. Procedures for future amendment of the guidelines should be adopted that involve, as a minimum: consultation before amendments are promulgated, and public hearings by the JCPA where such consultation reveals significant objections to the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that the JCPA has recommended that `PM&amp; establish procedures to receive and consider proposals for amendments to the Guidelines for the [Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports]' (recommendation 5 of Report 304, Guidelines for Departmental Annual Reports). </PARA>
<PARA>Revised departmental annual report guidelines were issued in 1987 and 1991 after consultation involving PM&amp;, the Department of Finance, other departments and certain agencies. When the 1991 guidelines were prepared, the Government had available to it the views and recommendations of the SSCFPA and other Senate committees and the JCPA, as set out in a number of reports. These views and recommendations were taken into account. The JCPA approved the guidelines issued in 1987 and 1991 before they were presented to Parliament as required by the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA>Procedures for amending the guidelines in future are set out in the preamble to the revised guidelines at page 7 and will be as follows: PM&amp; will write early in the second half of each financial year to all departments about the guidelines to be followed in the preparation of that year's reports; at the same time it will invite departments to pass on in due course any comments or suggestions that may occur to them as a result of using that year's guidelines, and will draw attention to any changes made in the guidelines for the current year, including any changes made as a result of departments' suggestions the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>The handling of suggestions will depend on their nature. In some cases more elaborate consultation procedures will be necessary than in others, but in all cases changes will need to be presented to the Parliament by the Prime Minister after approval by the JCPA. It will be for the JCPA to consider whether or not to hold public hearings. In some cases when new requirements are introduced departments may need time to establish data bases and procedures before they will be able to comply with the new requirements in preparing their annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>9. Responsibility for the guidelines should remain with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet but the Department must adopt a broader, more dynamic and proactive role as coordinator and, more importantly, custodian of the guidelines on annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that the JCPA has recommended that `PM&amp; continue in the role of co-ordinator of the Guidelines [for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports] and become more active in providing clarification of the Guidelines and coordinating proposals for change' (recommendation 7 of Report 304, Guidelines for Departmental Annual Reports). </PARA>
<PARA>PM&amp; has co-ordinated work on revised guidelines for departmental annual reports issued in 1987 and 1991. It has written to departments in the past about their reporting obligations and in future will write to them each year as outlined in the response to recommendation 8. In this way, PM&amp; fosters compliance with the guidelines; it does not have the additional role of monitoring departments' annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will assign to the appropriate agency the task of co-ordinating work on the preparation of new guidelines on statutory authorities' annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>10. A Handbook of External Reporting should be developed and maintained by PM&amp; to consolidate annual reporting requirements currently scattered in various pieces of legislation and other documents. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that the JCPA has recommended that `PM&amp; compile and disseminate an Annual Reporting Handbook which consolidates all documents specifying requirements for departmental annual reports' (recommendation 48 of Report 304, Guidelines for Departmental Annual Reports). </PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports and material associated with them are to be included in the Managers' Toolbox maintained by the Department of Finance. PM&amp; will remind agencies responsible for the associated material of the need to ensure that the latest versions are available in the Toolbox (see the preamble to the revised guidelines, paragraph 5.3). </PARA>
<PARA>11. The Handbook of External Reporting should also incorporate the guidelines for explanatory notes. </PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines issued for the preparation of Program Performance Statements (formerly called Explanatory Notes) for the Budget Estimates are available in the Managers' Toolbox. Revised guidelines are expected to be available in the Toolbox later in 1991, as are the guidelines issued for the preparation of Explanatory Notes for the Additional Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>12. The title `Explanatory Notes' should be replaced by `Program Performance Statement'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has agreed to a similar recommendation which was made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its review of the Financial Management Improvement Program, Not Dollars Alone. The name change will more accurately reflect the actual role and function of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>13. All annual reports should include a comprehensive index and should also contain, just before the index, a section that cross references the requirements of the guidelines of the contents of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes:</PARA>
<PARA>* the SSCFPA's comment in its Report on Annual Reports: Reports Tabled July-December 1989 that a quality index is a useful adjunct to a report of more than 50 pages (p.6);</PARA>
<PARA>* the SSC on Industry, Science and Technology's comment in its Report on Annual Reports: Reports Tabled July-December 1989 that, while hesitating to nominate a report size below which an index is not required, and while considering a detailed contents page to suffice for reports under 20 pages, it considered an index essential for substantial reports, for example reports over 20 pages; and the Committee's recommendation that agencies include in their reports a checklist of reporting requirements which indicates whether or not in the agency's view each guideline or part thereof has been covered and if it has where in the report and if not why it has not been covered (p.6);</PARA>
<PARA>* the SSC on Employment, Education and Training's comment in its Report on Annual Reports (May 1990) that a checklist or summary of reporting requirements `would help the Committee locate within the report the particular issues which the guidelines identify as topics on which information should be provided' (p.2);</PARA>
<PARA>* the SSC on Legal and Constitutional Affairs' recommendation in its Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee (May 1990) that the guidelines for both departments' and statutory authorities' annual reports be amended so as to require each report to contain a section showing which pages of the report relate to each requirement of the relevant guidelines (p.ll);</PARA>
<PARA>* the JCPA's recommendation in its Report 299, Compliance with Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports, that all departmental annual reports contain, in addition to any other form of index, a section that cross references the requirements of the Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports to the contents of the report (p.14); and</PARA>
<PARA>* the JCPA's recommendation in its Report 304, Guidelines for Departmental Annual Reports, that the revised Guidelines require each report to contain a table of contents, index to contents required by the guidelines and alphabetical index (recommendation 29). </PARA>
<PARA>The 1991 revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports include a section at page 8 on aids to access. This section requires that each departmental annual report contain a table of contents, an alphabetical index (optional if the report is less than 50 pages long) and an index of requirements showing where in the report the content relating to each requirement numbered in the guidelines is located. If any requirement was not applicable to the department during the year, the index of reporting requirements is to show this, and, if any requirement was not met for any other reason, the reason is to be shown. </PARA>
<PARA>When the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to including similar requirements in any new document. </PARA>
<PARA>14. The forthcoming review of annual report guidelines should produce specific standards for the presentation of some classes of information in annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes the Committee's concern that any detailed prescriptions on standardised presentation of information should leave scope for departmental innovation (paragraph 4.40). </PARA>
<PARA>It notes the JCPA's recommendations (Nos 36-39, Report 304), that:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the co-ordination of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, consideration be given to the scope for development of standard contents and or presentation requirements for the various topics which the guidelines require that annual reports address (36);</PARA>
<PARA>Under the co-ordination of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, consideration be given to which organisations would be best placed to draft standard content or presentation requirements for each topic (37);</PARA>
<PARA>If standard content or presentation requirements are to be prepared for any topics, they be prepared for adoption with effect from the 1990-91 annual reports (38); and</PARA>
<PARA>Consideration be given to standard reporting formats being compulsory at the broad level, for example, a specific topic in a specific appendix, but optional at detailed levels, for example, layout of tables to show staffing information (39). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes, too, the comments of the JCPA that `The Committee had not considered it necessary for the Guidelines to address [the extent to which it is acceptable to provide information in a standard format in appendixes] as it anticipated that, given a requirement to report, departments would provide the required information in the form which best suited their circumstances. The Committee can see considerable advantage in much of the detailed information being presented in appendices, but is [reluctant] to prescribe that or any other form of presentation' (p.53); and that `With regard to presentation requirements, such as standard formats for personnel information, the Committee foresees departments having concerns at being required to report in inappropriate formats' (p.57). </PARA>
<PARA>The preamble to the revised guidelines provides at paragraph 2.11 that, except to the extent prescribed in the guidelines, the content and format of annual reports are to be determined by Secretaries. The Government places considerable importance on the principle that Secretaries should have as much freedom as possible to determine the nature of their annual reports and should be responsible for the results. This principle is consistent with measures taken by the Government to devolve management responsibilities to individual departments, and it recognises the need to allow each department the scope to tailor its reports to the particular nature of its operations, which may differ in significant ways from those of other departments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that an appropriate balance between prescription and freedom has been struck in the revised guidelines. Detailed minimum requirements have been set in relation to a number of matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Particular areas where, in the Committee's view, presentation standards could be introduced have been examined in the revision of the departmental annual report guidelines, with results as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>* use of a table of contents and an index-the revised guidelines require annual reports to contain these, but do not attempt to lay down standardised formats for them (see response to recommendation 13, and revised guidelines, page 8);</PARA>
<PARA>* use of standard appendices for required items, for example Appendix 1 should always have the same contents in reports that use appendices the Government considers that the aids to access now required in departmental annual reports will obviate any need for this level of prescription;</PARA>
<PARA>* specified minimum levels and types of staffing information-the section on staffing information in the revised guidelines (page 16) has been made clearer and more specific;</PARA>
<PARA>* reports to be structured in program format-the section on program reporting in the guidelines (page 14) has been revised. Information is required about each of the department's programs and the annual report will identify the operational approaches adopted and issues confronted in the implementation or maintenance of each program over the past year. There may be some parts of the report's contents, however, which cannot be addressed clearly in strict program format. Each departmental Secretary has discretion to determine which topics might best be consolidated to form separate sections of the report;</PARA>
<PARA>* information in standard form on the use of consultants, business regulations, post-separation employment cases, NSBs and reviews by the Auditor-General-the relevant sections of the guidelines (pages 23, 30, 20,10, 26) have been made clearer and more specific; and</PARA>
<PARA>* FOI information-the current arrangements appear to be satisfactory. Agencies may obtain advice from the FOI and Human Rights Branch of the Attorney-General's Department on such matters as information required and format in section 8 statements . </PARA>
<PARA>When the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to following similar principles, as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>15. The review of the guidelines should also give weight to concerns that the scope of performance information required in annual reports is unclear and that inadequate recognition is given to the contributions made by people to the performance of government programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports (page 14) encourage departments where relevant to report progress at the operational level against published corporate or strategic plans and portfolio evaluation plans, in sections of their annual reports which deal with programs. When the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to including a similar requirement in any new document, as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that by its reference to `recognition of the contributions of people', the Committee intends that reports should show `the kind of attention and leadership given to people', and, in reporting on the achievement of objectives, should describe `other important, people- related management issues such as staff development, staff mobility, recognition and reward, appraisal schemes, staff facilities and the impact of restructures and how they were handled' (p.25). </PARA>
<PARA>The revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports require departments to report on some of the issues identified by the Committee. It is for departmental managers to decide how this material may best be incorporated in the report, though the Government agrees that the connection between `people-related management issues' and the achievement of objectives should be drawn out. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's comments are drawn to the attention of departments in an appendix to the revised guidelines, and will be taken into account when the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced. </PARA>
<PARA>16. All annual reports for the 1989-90 financial year should be tabled on or before 30 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>17. All annual reports for the 1990-91 and subsequent financial years should be tabled on or before 31 October. </PARA>
<PARA>All departments and most other agencies are currently required to report on a financial year basis. Subsection 34c(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that periodic reports must be furnished `as soon as practicable after the end of the particular period to which the report relates and, in any event, within 6 months after the end of that particular period'. In the case of agencies reporting on a financial year basis, the deadline for furnishing reports is thus 31 December. The Government expects agencies to make their annual reports available as soon as practicable, as the Act requires. The responses to recommendations 18 and 20-21 below indicate that agencies should if possible complete their annual reports in time for Ministers to table them before the Senate estimates hearings or, if that target cannot be met, before the end of the Budget Sittings. These requirements are taken up in the preamble to the guidelines on the preparation of departmental annual reports (p.5). </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian National Audit Office has advised that, because of the number of agencies whose financial statements it must audit, it may not be able to complete audits in time to allow all agencies to table their annual reports on or before 30 November or 31 October. It considers that fewer difficulties may be experienced when agencies have had time to adapt their accounting systems to cope with requirements now in the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>New requirements have also been added to the guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports. The addition of new reporting requirements may add to the time needed for the preparation of annual reports. This aspect of the situation will be monitored and taken into account when future decisions are made on reporting deadlines. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes the SSCFPA's comment, in its report, Departmental Annual Reports for 1988-89, that in 1989 almost all departments would have met the tighter deadline recommended by the Committee for 1989-90 reports (p.4). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided, however, that for the time being the 6-month deadline will remain, but that the following action is to be taken to promote timely reporting:</PARA>
<PARA>* Secretaries of departments and heads of agencies, in the statements or letters of transmittal prepared in relation to their annual reports, are to include a statement of the terms of subsection 34c(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act (and, if applicable, those of subsection 34c(4) or 34c(7)); and</PARA>
<PARA>* PM&amp; is to inquire of the Audit Office, and to advise the Committee by the end of 1992, what scope the Audit Office then sees for shortening the 6-month deadline. PM&amp; will also seek advice on the likelihood of printing bottlenecks, and will consult departments about pressures they have experienced in preparing their reports. </PARA>
<PARA>18. The present requirement for draft annual reports to be available to Senate Estimates Committees should be removed from the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1987 guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports required that reports be available for the estimates hearings or, if reports were not available, that `interim statements' (not explicitly drafts of reports) be provided. The current guidelines for statutory authorities' annual reports require that reports be provided if possible in time for the estimates hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that the SSCFPA's recommendation was made in conjunction with a recommendation (no. 27) intended to provide for parliamentary scrutiny of annual reports outside the estimates hearings; and that the recommendation that tabling deadlines be brought forward to 31 October (no. 17) was made as an `alternative' to the present requirement for interim statements (Departmental Annual Reports for 1988-89, p.4). If these recommendations were taken up (and if Program Performance Statements are self-contained, as they should be) there would be little point in retaining the requirement for interim statements for use by Estimates Committees. Recommendation 27 was taken up by the Senate in a Resolution of 14 December 1989, and parliamentary scrutiny will be extended with implementation of the JCPA's recommendation (no. 2 of Report 304) that standing committees of the House of Representatives be assigned the ongoing role of conducting reviews of departmental operations based upon the annual reports of departments. However, at this stage it has not seemed feasible to take up recommendation 17. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes, too, that the JCPA has recommended retention of the requirement for interim statements (recommendation 25, Report 304), and that some Senate Estimates Committees have also expressed support for its retention. </PARA>
<PARA>In these circumstances, it would be reasonable to retain the requirement, provided that any interim statements made available could be of real use to the Parliament. The SSCFPA has commented that unfinalised documents are not a satisfactory basis for parliamentary scrutiny and that reports or drafts cannot be used by Estimates Committees unless provided in good time (paragraphs 5.9-10). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided that agencies' annual reports or material to be included in them should, unless there is a specific reason, be made available to Senate Estimates Committees prior to hearings involving the respective agencies. It may be inappropriate for agencies to make available content that has not yet been settled, though material submitted to Senate Estimates Committee Secretariats may be accompanied by unaudited financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA>Portfolios will continue to be required to lodge their Program Performance Statements (formerly called Explanatory Notes) with the Senate Table Office soon after the Budget, as part of the series of Budget and Budget-related papers. Subsequently, but prior to the conduct of hearings of the Senate Estimates Committees, portfolios will also submit to Committee Secretariats tabled annual reports of portfolio agencies and, in relation to agencies whose reports have not been tabled, interim statements. These interim statements need not be drafts of annual reports (or drafts of parts of them) but should indicate what material could be made available should Committees wish to request it. </PARA>
<PARA>These requirements are set out in the preamble to the revised guidelines for departmental annual reports (paragraph 3.9), and will be taken into account when the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced. </PARA>
<PARA>19. Copies of current corporate plans, where they exist, should be provided to Senate Estimates Committees with the explanatory notes. </PARA>
<PARA>Some agencies have made a practice of letting Estimates Committees have copies of their corporate plans. The Government, while having no wish to discourage this practice, is unwilling to make a requirement that all agencies adopt it, feeling rather that it is for the management of an agency to decide the nature of any corporate plan it produces. Any accountability features of a corporate plan should be made available in some form to the Minister and the Parliament, and agencies may well feel that the most convenient way to make them available is to provide a copy of the plan. </PARA>
<PARA>Annual reports and Portfolio Program Performance Statements (formerly called Explanatory Notes) form the chief accountability documents for agencies. The Program Performance Statements, as previously was the case with Portfolio Explanatory Notes, are the Minister's document provided to Parliament to demonstrate the effectiveness of programs by detailing the resource requirements and related performance targets which have been set for achievement over the period of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Annual reports, on the other hand, focus below the portfolio level as a means of bringing together information on an agency's activities. In effect, the annual report provides the major avenue by which an agency head can account to the Minister for the administrative efficiency of that agency. The Minister, in turn, tables the annual report in Parliament as a statement of the agency's efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>Program Performance Statements and annual reports, therefore, serve quite distinct purposes, but are complementary in their nature. Portfolios are encouraged to take advantage of this complementarity so that, in submitting documents (or interim statements) to the Senate Estimates Committees, unnecessary overlap and duplication between the two documents is avoided or minimised. This can be achieved through effective cross-referencing between the documents, as well as to other sources of more detailed information relating to program performance, such as corporate plans. All the documents referred to, however, must be made available to the Estimates Committees at the same time as the Program Performance Statements and annual reports (or interim statements). </PARA>
<PARA>20. The Acts Interpretation Act should be amended to provide for ministers to table annual reports within seven calendar days of receiving them but, in any event, no later than 30 November 1990 for the 1989-90 report and 31 October each year for all subsequent reports. </PARA>
<PARA>21. The Acts Interpretation Act should be amended to explicitly provide for the tabling of annual reports to the Presiding Officers of the Parliament when neither the Senate or the House of Representatives is sitting between the date of receipt of any annual report by a minister and seven days later or the reporting date. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government recognises that the earlier annual reports are publicly available the more useful they may be, and it considers therefore that reports should be tabled as soon as practical after being received by Ministers. Subsection 25(8) of the Public Service Act 1922 and subsection 34c(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 require a Minister to have an annual report tabled in both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days after the day on which the Minister receives the report. Sitting patterns are currently such that in normal circumstances this gives a maximum period of between five and seven weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Committee recognises, any attempt to shorten this period by converting it to a number of calendar days would entail providing somehow for reports to be tabled on non-sitting days. There are arrangements currently in place for papers to be circulated out of session and so made publicly available. Such circulation, however, does not amount to tabling. Papers circulated out of session still need to be formally tabled when the Parliament next sits. The Government understands that the view is taken in some quarters of the Parliament that it is not normally appropriate to circulate and make public papers required to be presented to the Parliament, before those papers have in fact been so presented. On the other hand, the view is taken that papers should be made available as early as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Resolution of these views is a matter for the Presiding Officers and the Parliament, which may wish to inquire what scope there may be, either for the use of resolutions along the lines of those adopted from time to time (chiefly by the Senate) that in the event of the respective Presiding Officer's receiving a particular paper (or a paper of a particular kind) out of session the paper shall be deemed to have been presented to the respective House; or for suitable amendments to Standing Orders. The Government would be prepared to consider the introduction of a 21 calendar day tabling period if provision existed for tabling out of session. </PARA>
<PARA>In the meantime, in an effort to reduce delay, the Government is willing to undertake that a Minister, if 21 calendar days have elapsed since he or she received an annual report, will endeavour to table the report within the next 3 sitting days. If the statutory 15 sitting day period should expire before those 3 sitting days have elapsed, the Minister will of course be bound to meet the statutory obligation. </PARA>
<PARA>As indicated in the response to recommendation 18, there is a requirement that annual reports be furnished to Ministers if possible in time for tabling prior to the estimates hearings. If that target cannot be met, departments and Ministers will in any event endeavour to make annual reports available before the end of the Budget Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>The preamble to the revised guidelines on the preparation of departmental annual reports (pages 5-6) refers to the tabling arrangements set out above. The Government will assess the operation of the new arrangements, and will take the findings into account when the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue of tabling by the end of October or November is addressed in the response to recommendations 16 and 17. </PARA>
<PARA>22. The letter of transmittal to the minister from the departmental secretary or chief executive of an organisation, which is currently printed within the report, should be replaced by a separate covering letter not printed in the report. A copy of this letter should be sent to the Clerk of each House. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes the difficulty which the Committee has had in trying to ascertain when reports were furnished to Ministers. It notes, too, the SSCFPA's reference to this recommendation in its Report on Annual Reports: Reports Tabled July-December 1989 (p.ll), and the support for the recommendation expressed by:</PARA>
<PARA>* the President of the Senate, in his August 1990 President's Report on Annual Reports (p.2);</PARA>
<PARA>* the SSC on Employment, Education and Training, in its May 1990 Report on Annual Reports (the Committee also expressed the view that any letter of transmittal within annual reports should be undated);</PARA>
<PARA>* the SSC on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, in its May 1990 report, Examination of Annual Reports (p.4); and</PARA>
<PARA>* the SSC on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in its May 1990 Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee (p.8). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that agencies and Ministers should be able to demonstrate their compliance with the statutory requirement that reports be furnish to Ministers by a certain date (Acts Interpretation Act subsection 34c(2)) and tabled within a certain period after the date on which reports are received by Ministers (Public Service Act subsection 25(8), Acts Interpretation Act subsection 34c(3)). </PARA>
<PARA>An agency cannot accurately predict how long the interval will be between the date when the text of its report (including any letter of transmittal incorporated in it) is finalised and the date when printed copies are available to be furnished to the Minister. Nor can it be assumed that the date of furnishing will be the same as the date on which the Minister receives a report. </PARA>
<PARA>Whether or not reports are furnished to Ministers with separate covering letters, there remains a need for each report to incorporate a statement by the agency head certifying its compliance with (e.g.) section 25 of the Public Service Act. That statement should be signed and dated. </PARA>
<PARA>The revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports include a requirement (no. 01) that the annual report of a department contain a statement by the Secretary, dated when the Secretary gives the text final clearance to be printed. When the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be give to including a similar requirement in any new document. </PARA>
<PARA>Agencies, in furnishing reports to Ministers, may if they wish do so under cover of separate (dated) letters. To meet the concerns expressed by parliamentary committees, Ministers, in tabling reports, will advise the Parliament on what date or dates the reports were furnished to and received by them. </PARA>
<PARA>23. It should be mandatory for departmental secretaries or chief executives of other agencies to lodge an explanation of late tabling, on a standard form, before the tabling deadline expires. If there are further delays an additional explanation of late tabling form should be submitted before the expiry of the extended tabling date. </PARA>
<PARA>24. All explanations of late tabling should be forwarded to the Clerks of both Houses who should table the forms as they are received. </PARA>
<PARA>The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that when a report will not be ready in time, the person responsible for furnishing it to the Minister may (not must) apply in advance for additional time to complete the report, and that the person must, if application is made, furnish an explanation of the delay. The Minister may grant additional time and must table the application/explanation and his or her response within 3 sitting days. The Act also provides that, when a report has not been furnished on time, the person responsible for the report must furnish an explanation to the Minister within 14 days and the Minister must table the explanation within 3 sitting days of receipt. </PARA>
<PARA>The Act provides that further extensions of time may be sought in advance and that further explanations must be provided when deadlines already extended are not met. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that there may be cases when a person responsible for a report may reasonably expect up until very close to the deadline to be able to meet that deadline. For that reason, the Government has decided not to make action in advance of a breach of a deadline mandatory. The Government agrees, however, that advance notice is preferable to retrospective notice, and that, when an explanation of a late report is given retrospectively, the agency head may reasonably be expected to explain why advance notice was not given. The guidelines for departmental annual reports (preamble, paragraph 3.6) have been amended accordingly, and when the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to including a similar requirement in any new document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that explanations should include information in relation to the headings in the standard form proposed by the Committee, but it considers it is enough for agencies to be advised the information is required, without having standard forms supplied. It is not appropriate, moreover, for agencies to submit explanations of late reporting direct to the Presiding Officers. If their reports are furnished late, they owe explanations to Ministers, who table those explanations in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>25. Ministers, when tabling annual reports, should draw the attention of the House or the Senate to any annual reports which are being tabled later than the tabling deadline for the year to which the report relates. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that when a report is furnished late, the Minister in tabling the report should advise the Parliament by what date the report had originally been due. The revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports include a requirement along these lines (preamble, paragraph 3.8), and when the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to including a similar requirement in any new document. </PARA>
<PARA>26. Depending on the nature of the reason for late tabling, this Committee or the JCPA should consider requiring the departmental secretary or chief executive of any other agency to attend a public hearing to further explain the delay. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter for the two committees. Secretaries and heads of agencies are required to follow principles set out in the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related matters. </PARA>
<PARA>27. A regular program of scrutiny should be adopted by legislative and general purpose committees of the Senate based on annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA>28. The President of the Senate should provide each year a report listing the dates of tabling of all annual reports, the dates the reports were sent to ministers and the reasons for late tabling. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that the Senate passed a resolution in relation to recommendations 27 and 28 on 14 December 1989, and that reports by the President and the legislative and general purpose committees of the Senate have been tabled pursuant to that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Difficulties associated with determining the dates on which annual reports were furnished to Ministers are addressed in the Government's response to recommendation 22. </PARA>
<PARA>29. Legislative and general purpose committees of the Senate should use the RAIPA annual report awards judges' report as input to hearings with representatives of executive agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter for the committees. </PARA>
<PARA>30. Parliamentary departments should be required to report under the same guidelines as executive departments and should be subject to the same processes of committee scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government notes that the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives have agreed that the parliamentary departments should comply with the guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports.</PARA>
<PARA>PM&amp; has now included the parliamentary departments on its mailing list for circular letters about the guidelines, and, subject to consideration of any advice received regarding difficulties experienced by those departments in complying with the guidelines, subsection 25(9) of the Public Service Act 1922 will be amended to require their reports to be prepared in accordance with the guidelines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make a few remarks about this Government response, which in general terms I welcome. Most of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration have been agreed to, though I regret that some of them are a bit too hidebound by the fairly religious adherence to the devolution theory that is around these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also regret that it has taken two years for this response to come to us. I do not think that such a delay is good enough. I realise that it has been partly caused by the fact that other committees in the meantime have made similar recommendations, but I am not sure that that can seriously be accepted as a reason for delay. It is just an indication that, because of the delay, there has been a re-emphasis by other committees of the sorts of things proposed by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, on the question of delays in tabling, we are still waiting for the Government response to the Committee's report on government companies. The time delay is of a similar order in that case, and unfortunately many of the recommendations are therefore becoming outdated merely because of the passage of time. I think that is a matter to be seriously regretted. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not comment on the Government's responses to every one of the many recommendations in the report of the Committee entitled The Timeliness and Quality of Annual Reports, but I look first at recommendation No. 6 and the Government's response to it. This recommendation concerned the continuing suggestion of the Committee that the Government should maintain a register of non-statutory bodies so that the list is continually available rather than having to rely only on annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in the response, this matter having been mentioned again in our report, the Government has indicated that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet may in fact be introducing a computerised system to record the appointment of people in the equal employment opportunity target groups to statutory and other government bodies and that, therefore, the Government might find it useful to effectively have a register, as has been recommended in the past by the Committee. I welcome this belated recognition that it is useful to the Government to have a continuous register of those bodies, and I am glad to see that it may well come about by this indirect route. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation No. 17, the Committee recommended that all annual reports for 1989-90 should be tabled on or before 30 November 1990 and that all annual reports for 1991 and subsequent financial years should be tabled on or before 31 October to improve the time taken for annual reports to be tabled after the end of the period being reported on. The response from the Government is for the Australian National Audit Office to advise the Committee by the end of 1992 on the scope the Audit Office sees for shortening the six-month deadline that currently exists. I think that response is rather on the weak side. I would have preferred a stronger commitment to abbreviating the required time for tabling of annual reports. Most departments have satisfied well and truly the shorter time period, but my view is that to make it a formal requirement would have been preferable. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I would like to comment on is recommendation No. 20, which was our suggestion that the Acts Interpretation Act should be amended to provide for Ministers to table annual reports within seven calendar days of receiving them, as well as complying with the overall time requirement. In this case, the Government has said that it would be prepared to consider the introduction of a 21 calendar day tabling period if provision existed for tabling out of session. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that this issue requires an acknowledgment that providing an annual report to the Presiding Officers under the procedures of the Senate could involve that report being deemed to have been tabled and therefore avoiding long delays due to the Parliament not perhaps being in session at the time a report becomes available. Even given that, I suggest that the 21 calendar day period is still longer than is necessary. I cannot understand why seven days is not reasonable enough. There is no particular need for a Minister to sit on a report once it has been received. I do not see any reason why within a very short period after a report's reception it ought not to be tabled. We acknowledge that the main delay is the time it takes for a department or an agency to prepare a report, to have it audited and to have it printed, but once it is finally provided to the Minister there should be no reason for any further delay in the tabling by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue that we dealt with was the question of keeping track of compliance with the timing requirements. There was the problem of the letter of transmittal of a report being incorporated in a report before it was printed and, therefore, the date of actual receipt by the Minister not being easily ascertained. The Government has agreed that agencies and Ministers should be able to demonstrate their compliance with the statutory requirement. The response has been that to meet the concerns expressed by parliamentary committees Ministers, in the tabling of reports, will advise the Parliament on what date or dates the reports were furnished to and received by them. That is not exactly the way in which the Committee recommended it should happen, but at least it will be an improvement in that people can see the exact dates involved and there will not then need to be a wild goose chase trying to clear up any apparent delays that might appear on the surface. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 23 talked about it being mandatory for departmental secretaries or chief executives to lodge an explanation about any late tabling. The Government has agreed that explanations should be provided and should include information in relation to the headings and the standard form proposed by the Committee. The Government considers that it is enough for agencies to be advised of the information without having standard forms supplied. </PARA>
<PARA> The response makes the point that it is not appropriate for agencies to submit explanations of late reporting direct to the Presiding Officers. If their reports are furnished late, they owe explanations to Ministers, who table those explanations in the Parliament. I acknowledge that point of protocol, but I emphasise that the suggestion of the Committee was an attempt to streamline the process. The intention was to treat such explanations in a formula way, as routine, so that they were therefore able to be tabled amongst the papers tabled by the Clerk rather than such a relatively simple matter having to be tabled by a Minister, who has to go through all the formalities, which are almost equivalent to the tabling of the report itself. Recommendation No. 25 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Ministers, when tabling annual reports, should draw the attention of the House or the Senate to any annual reports which are being tabled later than the tabling deadline for the year to which the report relates. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has agreed that when that happens the Minister should advise the Parliament in that way. There are many other comments on this matter I would like to make but, in order to abbreviate the proceedings, I conclude my remarks there. Despite the long delay in this response coming, I welcome it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>...JUNE 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA>On 29 May 1990, the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology tabled its Report ``People and Technology: New Management Techniques in Manufacturing Industry''. This Report stemmed from the Committee's earlier Report of September 1988, titled ``Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation: Making it Together''. </PARA>
<PARA>In that 1988 Report, the Committee reviewed a number of unproductive attitudes which it considered could be changed, to revitalise the manufacturing sector. This 1990 Report has examined in greater depth the following key recommendations from the Committee's earlier review:</PARA>
<PARA>* that new management techniques be introduced where practicable;</PARA>
<PARA>* that labour improve its situation, for example, by taking the lead in negotiating removal of restrictive work and management practices;</PARA>
<PARA>* that management become committed to the ideal of industrial democracy and encourage greater involvement of the workforce in productivity, quality and safety matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Main Considerations of this Report</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted the economic imperative for improvement in Australia's manufacturing performance and that a key feature of successfully developed economies is a strong manufacturing sector with a skilled and committed workforce. To increase productivity and restore Australian industry's international competitiveness, the Committee considered that manufacturers needed to assess whether their company's performance measured up to a ``successful enterprise'' and whether the company had appropriate human resource policies and practices in place. </PARA>
<PARA>As examined in this Report, the term ``New Management Techniques'' was used in two ways. First, it referred to a range of advanced management technologies and systems, such as Value-Added-Management (VAM), Just-inTime (JIT), and Computer-aided Design/Manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Second, it covered the more general management/workforce relationship, with an emphasis on decisions made on the basis of employee involvement. </PARA>
<PARA>While there had been some take up of these best management practices by many businesses, the Committee concluded that there had been limited and insufficient implementation of these new technologies. The reasons included a general short-term emphasis on increased sales that outweighed the strategic investment in technology needed to gain a longer-term competitive advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>A wider attitudinal change was seen to be necessary, so that decisions could be driven by a strategic vision that was communicated to all levels of staff and employees and guided day-to-day decisions about resources and production. The TAFE educational system was considered to be a vital ingredient in the skills formation necessary for the advanced technologies and new management techniques, in order to be able to apply this strategic vision. More interaction between industry and TAFE was considered by the Committee to be desirable, particularly concerning curriculum development that incorporated these manufacturing and management philosophies. </PARA>
<PARA>Inherent in the successful outcome from adopting these philosophies and practices would be a greater feeling of common purpose amongst employers and employees. However, the Committee suggested that many factors work against such a common purpose being developed, including mistrust between management and the workforce, educational difficulties, and demarcation disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believed that there was high recognition in industry of the need to adopt the measures it had been reviewing, but that this would not necessarily lead to action. It suggested that national and state governments should use their coordinating powers to bring together the various groups involved with improving manufacturing sector productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to current government activity, the Committee acknowledged the central role of the National Industry Extension Service (NIES) in providing information about the services available to manufacturing industry. It did note, however, that for the NIES programs to be effective there would need to be greater awareness of the new management techniques and their relevance to a firm. </PARA>
<PARA>This awareness would be raised in three ways. First, by industry knowing about the support services available not only from government but also from peak bodies such as the Australian Institute of Management. Second, by unions continuing award restructuring and encouraging multi-skilling. Third, tertiary education should be better known, more accessible and more responsive to industry training needs. </PARA>
<PARA>As the first step for action, the Committee recommended that an Australian model for new management techniques was required. The model was to take account of uniquely Australian factors, while drawing on the best of world experience and adapting it to Australian experience. The Committee then made a number of recommendations about developing the model through a series of national conferences and then using the draft model as a basis for separate industry models. </PARA>
<PARA>In all, the Committee made eighteen recommendations. Three of these are specifically directed at firms in the manufacturing sector, as means to assist them in becoming internationally competitive. A further four are directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in relation to his responsibilities for the technical and further education system and its interaction with the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA>An additional four are addressed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, including the principal one of developing the proposed Australian model of new management techniques. The balance of seven recommendations relates to the series of national conferences that are suggested as the means of discussing, developing and refining the model. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, I would like to indicate that I am making this response jointly on behalf of my portfolio and my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The Committee is to be congratulated for the breadth of its examination of this vital topic, as may be seen by the cross-portfolio issues it has raised for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>In considering the Government's response to the Committee's report, I put some thought into firstly reviewing the problems identified by the Committee and then secondly looking at the solutions proposed through the series of recommendations. I share the concerns of the Committee about the rate of take-up by the manufacturing sector of new management techniques and the slow development of internationally competitive Australian enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>With this in mind, I believe that the Committee has correctly identified the two main management issues hindering the development of internationally competitive Australian enterprises. As outlined in the Report, the two issues are the slow take-up of new management techniques and, even more important, the lack of awareness of the services already available. This almost inevitably leads to the short-term emphasis on sales, without a long-term strategy to drive the development of appropriate products for markets in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>By contrast, this Government believes that an internationally competitive Australian firm needs to know exactly what it is good at doing, how it will win against its competitors, and also that it should have an excellent business plan as a road map for achieving its goals. A successful Australian business is a partnership: between the firm and its customers, and most important, between everyone working in the company. </PARA>
<PARA>Current Government Programs</PARA>
<PARA>This Government believes that its current programs are designed to achieve these results and are successfully contributing to the development of such firms. In this regard, I was pleased to read the positive and supportive references to the National Industry Extension Service (NIES) and the importance of its catalytic role as a change agent in providing information about best manufacturing and management practices. </PARA>
<PARA>Since it started in 1986, NIES has developed into a highly successful mechanism for enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of companies throughout Australia. NIES has also demonstrated that Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments can work together effectively on this important mission.</PARA>
<PARA>NIES offers a range of programs that can assist firms realise their competitive advantage through products that can sell in Australian and overseas markets. These programs include diagnostic assessment, strategic planning, business planning, advanced manufacturing technologies, human resources, product innovation, cost management, quality and export strategies.</PARA>
<PARA>Other Government Initiatives of 1990</PARA>
<PARA>(1) The New Workplace Culture</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased now also to be able to give an outline of other developments in 1990 that were highly relevant to the Committee's deliberations, involving my colleagues the Ministers for Employment, Education and Training and for Industrial Relations. These developments are mentioned here to show the scope of this Government's current action on the very real problems associated with developing internationally competitive Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Shortly after the Committee presented its Report ``People and Technology'', the Government also received the Pappas Carter Evans and Koop (PCEK) Report titled ``The Global Challenge'', dealing with Australian manufacturing in the 1990s. That Report has since received wide public debate, in the context of the direction of Australian manufacturing industry policy and what Government action may be appropriate. I would here like briefly to describe the Government's action so far, in relation to the New Workplace Culture aspects of the Report. </PARA>
<PARA>As ``The Global Challenge'' has noted, the culture that commonly exists in Australian workplaces presents a major handicap for the international competitiveness of our industry and typically results in work that falls short of international standards of quality and productivity. The PCEK Report considered that profound changes in attitude were needed by management, unions and training institutions, which it summarised as the requirement for a New Workplace Culture. </PARA>
<PARA>The key elements of the New Workplace Culture include:</PARA>
<PARA> - flatter organisational structures;</PARA>
<PARA> - continuous improvements in productivity and quality, by incorporating the ideas of workers at all levels;</PARA>
<PARA> - team-based approaches to problem-solving;</PARA>
<PARA> - technologies based on people and hardware;</PARA>
<PARA> - flexible production relying on multi-skilled workers;</PARA>
<PARA> - suppliers involved in product design, quality improvement and productivity efforts;</PARA>
<PARA> - human resource policies that encourage workers to be stakeholders in the corporation;</PARA>
<PARA> - support for skills upgrading and retraining across the firm's workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government was keen to quickly identify the factors which are contributing to the development of a new workplace culture. The Government formed a task-force involving the three portfolios mentioned previously, so that a comprehensive analysis could be made of these factors and any impediments to the adoption of a new workplace culture. </PARA>
<PARA>In recent months, the task-force engaged in intensive discussions with employer groups and unions, and with individual enterprises, to gather information on current progress in workplace reform and provide recommendations on appropriate government policy and programs. The Task Force presented its Report in the first week in February and its outcomes were the subject of Cabinet consideration in the context of the Industry Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Stemming from this consideration, an Australian Best Practice Demonstration Program was announced in the Government Statement ``Building a Competitive Australia'' on 12 March. The program is to be administered by the Department of Industrial Relations in conjunction with the Australian Manufacturing Council. It will consist of two elements:</PARA>
<PARA>* assistance to individual enterprises that wish to demonstrate their commitment to workplace reform and want to make substantial progress in achieving reform; and</PARA>
<PARA>* an integrated information campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Developments in Training</PARA>
<PARA>Against the background of the economic imperative to improve Australia's international competitiveness, the last two or three years have been characterised by significant changes in the environment in which the industry training system is operating. I would here like to outline two of these changes, which are very relevant to the Committee's considerations and which are set out in more detail in the attached replies to Recommendations 3, 4 and 5. </PARA>
<PARA>- Reforms to the Training system</PARA>
<PARA>In its micro-economic reform agenda, this Government has placed a high priority on making reforms in the Vocational Education and Training system, so as to increase the skills of the workforce and thereby improve enterprise productivity and competitiveness. Some significant achievements have been made, particularly during 1990, as the results of several years of review and consultation came to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year the National Training Board was established by the Commonwealth and States to set, in co-operation with Industry, national skill standards. These will underpin reformation of quality national curricula and a nationally consistent system of competency based training, which in turn will form the basis of a more competitive and market relevant system. </PARA>
<PARA>- Training in support of Award Restructuring</PARA>
<PARA>Further during 1990, my colleague together with State Ministers, commissioned a report from a Committee which was directed by leaders in industry, on the training costs of Award Restructuring. The Report (known as the Deveson Report) was considered by a special meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for Training on 2 November 1990, and was accepted as the basis for a more effective partnership between TAFE and Industry providers of training. </PARA>
<PARA>An historical consensus reached at this meeting was for the Commonwealth and States to work together to create the environment for an open and competitive training system which is market based and responsive to industry. This will see the development of industry and/or enterprise based training facilities which may be competitive with the public TAFE system, and which could also include joint ventures or other forms of inter-related training facilities in TAFE and Industry. Indeed some specific projects are already in train. </PARA>
<PARA>A further significant agreement by Ministers was the establishment of an Australian Committee for Training Curriculum, which will develop national core curricula for both on-and off-the-job training. It will also be able to produce training materials for both TAFE and private industry providers, taking into account industry priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The preceding developments will build on the already improved links between TAFE and industry that were established following the 1989 document Commonwealth Priorities for TAFE. Developments have included joint/cooperative arrangements with firms and industry associations, involvement at the local level by industry representatives on College Councils and in course development and evaluation activities, and co-operation with industries in the establishment and expansion of industry skill centres in key sectors involved in the award restructuring process. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Initiatives in Management Training</PARA>
<PARA> - Mission on Management Education</PARA>
<PARA>Another important initiative has recently been taken by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who has been reviewing his portfolio strategies for improving the quality of management training in Australia. This has been one consequence of the Report to him by the Employment and Skills Formation Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET), entitled Industry Training in Australia: the need for change. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister established a Mission on Management Education, which has undertaken a study on overseas trends in management education, training and development. In 1990, the Mission visited Japan, the USA and Europe to report on best practice management skills formation and key strategic initiatives that can be taken at enterprise, industry, state and national levels to enhance management skills formation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This enhancement will be critical in helping to instil management practices that place Australian industry on an internationally competitive footing. The Mission's report is expected to be available through NBEET for public debate and consultation in mid 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> -National Management Skills Formation Strategy</PARA>
<PARA>In his March 12 Industry Statement, the Prime Minister outlined the Government's commitment to the development of a National Management Skills Formation Strategy to strengthen management skills. The Strategy will involve research and policy measures that can identify the need and growth in demand for management skills. It will also ensure that the supply and quality of education, training and advisory services are adequate and responsive to the needs of management. </PARA>
<PARA>The Strategy will also seek to strengthen the links between training providers and employer and encourage business to develop more effective management skills programs. Input from a wide range of interested parties will be important in developing appropriate measures under the Strategy. Funding worth $2.3 million will be provided in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> - Training Needs of Small Business</PARA>
<PARA>A study of the training needs of small business has been undertaken by the Bureau of Industry Economics on behalf of DEET and DITAC. The study assesses the training needs of workers and management in a number of small businesses in key sectors (motels, metal fabrication, mechanical and electrical engineering, automotive components and information technology). Due for release in mid 1991, the study will underpin efforts to increase awareness by small business of the benefits of training, improve the quality of training provided by small businesses and facilitate access to it so that small business can participate more fully. </PARA>
<PARA> - National TAFE Curriculum: Export Practices &amp;Procedures</PARA>
<PARA>I note also that the Queensland Government Bureau of Employment, Vocational and Further Education and Training has proposed a national strategy to address problems identified in the NBEET report ``Benchmark Study of Management Development''. One of those problems was the low involvement of Australian organisations in international business and the strategy proposed is a national core curriculum for the TAFE system on Export Practices and Procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusions and intended Government action</PARA>
<PARA>Given the considerations I have detailed above and the initiatives already underway, I have some doubts about the need for yet another management model that would be in addition to those already available through NIES, other areas of the Government and the private sector. Similarly, I have reservations about the series of conferences recommended as the means of introducing and refining this model. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposals in the Report for the national conferences, formation of working groups and development of separate industry models represent extended processes that would not necessarily result in productive outcomes. I would also be concerned about the Federal Government being the sponsor of these processes, when there is the acknowledged need for the private sector to be more responsive in adopting the already existing best management practices. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I do acknowledge that the Government's existing programs are spread across several portfolios and may be difficult to access, from the perspective of an individual firm wishing to develop its strategies for international competitiveness. I agree with the Committee's comment on page 57 of its report about the need for a greater awareness of the new management techniques and their relevance to a firm. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequently, I have asked that the Bureau of Industry Economics include a segment on best management practice in its annual Industry Outlook Conference. Additionally, as a key issue is the awareness of the available management techniques, this Government intends to identify each of its current programs that are relevant to this theme and bring together this information into the one coordinated document, which would then be available to the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA>This information would principally bring together data about programs in the portfolios of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Employment, Education and Training, and Industrial Relations. Taken together, I suggest that they would outline an extensive Australian model of the current best manufacturing and management practices, being presently promoted by the Government, for developing an internationally competitive Australian enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>The foregoing initial comments and background will therefore be the basis of the Government's responses to the Committee's recommendations, which are attached to this statement. </PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSES TO EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 1</PARA>
<PARA>That the following definition of a ``successful company'' be adopted by businesses as their goal:</PARA>
<PARA> A world competitive company produces the highest quality products or services which exactly meet customer needs at the lowest possible cost. To achieve this, the enterprise workforce, at all levels, will share a common purpose enhanced through consultative and problem solving mechanisms, a commitment to skills training, career structures and access to appropriate technologies. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government endorses the definition and supports its adoption by businesses, noting that it is the basis of the NIES programs. Current Government actions to create an open training market which is responsive to industry needs, and in which skills acquired from structured training and relevant experience can be recognised, are designed to create the right environment for companies to take the initiative to develop the skills of their employees to the highest standards. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 2</PARA>
<PARA>That companies ensure that their corporate plan includes goals about technology and skills acquisition which are developed and worked towards following consultation at all levels from the Board of Directors to the production workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government strongly supports this recommendation, while acknowledging that this is an issue for consideration by individual enterprises. The Government is concerned that a more fundamental issue is the very large number of manufacturing companies which do not have corporate or strategic plans. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 3</PARA>
<PARA>That the Minister for Employment, Education and Training initiate, as a matter of urgency, the development and implementation of a core curriculum for institutions of technical and further education. This core curriculum should include a compulsory component of management education. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that the Commonwealth Government has no constitutional powers to direct specific changes in the TAFE sector. These matters are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. The Commonwealth, however, works co-operatively with those Governments to influence the common adoption of policies and practices in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, in 1989 the Commonwealth recognised</PARA>
<PARA>* the need to integrate and co-ordinate education and training policies and</PARA>
<PARA>* the need for close consultation between TAFE and relevant industries;</PARA>
<PARA>* the need for nationally agreed basis for the establishment curricula; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the need for a continuing commitment to interstate co-operative effort in TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers have now formally agreed that emphasis will be placed on the development of national industry skill standards, which in turn will form the basis for implementation of national core curricula and the expansion of competency-based trade training. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriate staff development activities, particularly for teachers, are also necessary and are being actively encouraged. Priority for the major curriculum development activities will go to those arising from award restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1990, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories established The National Training Board (NTB), to determine in consultation with industry, national skill and competence standards which all Governments have agreed to implement through the curricula and courses recognised in their State. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth, through DEET, also provides significant financial support for the Industry Training Advisory Boards (ITABs-formerly known as Industry Training Committees). These are industry owned and operated bodies which provide a formal two-way conduit for exchanging views and information between industry parties and Government on the needs for industry training. </PARA>
<PARA>These Boards work closely with the TAFE system to establish curricula for training courses across most industries. There are currently 121 of these Boards, organised into a National/State network to cover most industries; there were 21 new Committees established with Commonwealth funding during 1989/90. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed Action</PARA>
<PARA>In 1991, these national co-operative ventures will continue to be a high priority, using Commonwealth recurrent funding to the States for TAFE. This will enable each State and Territory to access funds for projects which are then made available freely through all TAFE systems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is also considering ways to enhance the network of ITABs so that they can continue to promote and develop systematic training in their industries and advise State and Commonwealth governments on training matters affecting their industries. This follows a comprehensive review conducted by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) during 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 4</PARA>
<PARA>That the Minister for Employment, Education and Training initiate processes which will allow transferable accreditation of training between levels of courses and states as well as examining in-house training programs and determining levels of accreditation for such programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Both Commonwealth and State Governments have recognised for some time that improved arrangements for recognising skills held by individuals and for the integration of on- and off-the-job training would lead to greater effectiveness of training outcomes and greater efficiency and equity in the workplace. They have been devoting considerable resources to developing appropriate means for addressing the issues in consultation with union and employer representatives, which includes considerable negotiation necessary to obtain consensus from all parties. </PARA>
<PARA>These issues are also integral to the industrial interests of the parties, and have been the subject of the negotiations involved in the award restructuring process. In particular, these negotiations have been working to establish agreement on mechanisms to allow for:</PARA>
<PARA>* greater reliability and flexibility in skills recognition arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA>* appropriate placement of people in the skills hierarchies established under restructured awards following initial translation;</PARA>
<PARA>* industry and geographic mobility;</PARA>
<PARA>* the recognition of skills gained informally; and</PARA>
<PARA>* incentives for workers to increase their skills and reskill in new areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth is pursuing these arrangements through the Commonwealth-State consultative forum. This is now represented by the newly formed Vocational Education and Training Advisory Committee (VEETAC), which has arisen from a merger of five former consultative fora. </PARA>
<PARA>Through joint Commonwealth and State co-operation two significant reports relevant to these issues have recently been released:</PARA>
<PARA>* the Report,</PARA>
<PARA>A Strategic Framework for the Implementation of a Competency based Training; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the Discussion paper,</PARA>
<PARA>Official Accreditation/Registration Arrangements for Vocational Courses/Training Programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Both of these documents have been developed through extensive consultation with key peak industrial parties over the past year, and the recommendations of the Report on competency based training were formally endorsed by Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers at a special meeting on 2 November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Following this agreement all Governments agreed to work to having substantial progress towards the development of competency based courses by the end of 1990. Ministers agreed to the establishment of a framework for national consistency in recognition of skills, accreditation and recognition of training providers and promotion of credit transfer arrangements. State authorities will continue to exercise their statutory functions within this agreed framework and lateral reciprocal agreements. This will streamline industry access to these regulatory services. </PARA>
<PARA>The development of national skill and competency standards through the National Training Board, and the shifting of the training system to a competency basis will provide the necessary underpinning for a nationally consistent set of recognition, accreditation and articulation arrangements. This will allow for real portability of skills and qualifications across State borders and in some cases between parts of some industries. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 5</PARA>
<PARA>That the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, as a matter of urgency, develop the interaction between TAFE and industry through an effective interchange program and equipment sharing for training. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>An increased importance of direct TAFE/Industry links has been a part of the reform of the industry training system which has been under review since 1989. It was overtly recognised in the 1989 document Commonwealth Priorities in TAFE, which set out a partnership in which human and capital resources of both TAFE institutions and industrial enterprises are used co-operatively to expand the provision of the quality of on-the-job and off-the-job training. </PARA>
<PARA>Since then, considerable achievements have been made in various States and Territories to make the TAFE systems more responsive to industry through joint ventures, business development units and special training of consultants to industry. The Commonwealth encourages the development of these initiatives through the annual resource agreements negotiated for the use of Commonwealth recurrent funding support which is provided to the State TAFE systems. </PARA>
<PARA>These specifically provide for, amongst other matters:</PARA>
<PARA>* involvement at the local level by industry representatives on TAFE College Councils and in course development and evaluation activities;</PARA>
<PARA>* continued provision for joint venture purchases; and</PARA>
<PARA>* co-operation with industry in the establishment and expansion of industry skill centres in key sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>Training provided through skill centres complements training available on-the-job, and through TAFE and other providers. Some centres are located in enterprises and some are stand alone facilities or are part of shared TAFE facilities. Since 1989 the Commonwealth has contributed directly to the establishment of twenty-four industry skill centres. </PARA>
<PARA>To build on these achievements, in 1991 the Commonwealth and States will introduce some new elements to increase the flexibility of programs to strengthen TAFE/industry links. These will include:</PARA>
<PARA>* provisions to fund TAFE projects constructed on industry owned land so that TAFE facilities can be close to industry; and</PARA>
<PARA>* provisions to expand joint venture proposals within general equipment allocations. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 6</PARA>
<PARA>That the development of an Australian model for new management techniques be a principal outcome of a series of national conferences which would serve to raise awareness of new management techniques. The model should be developed over successive conferences as experience and knowledge of relevant factors increases. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>PLUS</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 7</PARA>
<PARA>That the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce use the recommendations and comments in this Report as the basis for developing a draft model for consideration at the proposed conferences. Development of that draft model should take place following consultation with bodies such as the AMC and NIES. The draft model should form the basis for separate industry models which would clarify the terminology, specify the performance indicators and enable the identification of businesses able to meet the standards of the model. National and state conferences will provide the opportunity to discuss both the Australian and individual industry models and allow refinements to be made to assist Australian manufacturing to international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>PLUS</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 8</PARA>
<PARA>That national and state governments provide financial and secretariat support for the conferences which should be convened under the auspices of the Australian manufacturing industries' peak body, the AMC, because of its tripartite nature and comprehensive representation of manufacturing industry groups. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>PLUS</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 9</PARA>
<PARA>That initially a series of five national annual conferences be held along with complementary state conferences, the first of which should be held in early 1991. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>PLUS</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 10</PARA>
<PARA>That the first national conference cover matters such as:</PARA>
<PARA> - development of an Australian model for new management techniques as set out in paragraph 4.21 (of Report);</PARA>
<PARA> - development of working groups to discuss experiences with new management techniques, the education system's ability to train the workforce, etc;</PARA>
<PARA> - reports by consultants including case studies;</PARA>
<PARA> - international industry experience, including guest speakers and case studies;</PARA>
<PARA> - industry sector forecasts and trends;</PARA>
<PARA> - national and international economic forecasts;</PARA>
<PARA> - keynote addresses by relevant Ministers outlining government action;</PARA>
<PARA> - reports by peak bodies; and</PARA>
<PARA> - strategies for developing overseas markets, in conjunction with AUSTRADE. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>PLUS</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 11</PARA>
<PARA>That attendance at national conferences should be primarily for management/employee representatives of enterprises involved in implementing new management techniques, together with a smaller number of representatives of peak bodies, relevant academics and government officials. Organisations such as TQMI, AIM, TTC etc., which have expertise in running seminars and providing consultancy services for implementing new management techniques should also play a key role. Government and industry assistance should also be provided to enterprises or individuals able to prepare case studies or other relevant work for presentation at the conferences. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>PLUS</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 12</PARA>
<PARA>That state conferences build on matters raised at the national conferences with an emphasis on providing information about new management techniques to manufacturers at the enterprise level. These conferences should allow a two way flow of information to ensure that manufacturers are aware of developments and their relevance. At such conferences there should be representatives from the education systems as well as industry and government so that manufacturers can put their concerns to them. </PARA>
<PARA>Responses to Recommendations 6-12</PARA>
<PARA>As outlined in the covering introduction, the Government agrees with the problems that the Committee identified and considers that current Government programs and services already provide adequate access to the array of new management techniques. The importance of ``access'' is emphasised, as the main conclusions of the Committee related to the low use and, indeed, knowledge of the existing techniques and technologies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that it is more appropriate for industry to be made more aware of the range of Government and private sector services which are already available and which are acknowledged to be assisting the development of internationally competitive Australian enterprises. It would be preferable for industry to make better and more extensive use of those services already existing and available, than to introduce an additional model. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee did note the potential confusion possible when industry is considering the array of support services currently available. To address this potential, the Government will ensure that the services currently available in and through the portfolios of Industry, Technology and Commerce, Employment, Education and Training, and Industrial Relations, will be brought together into the one document. This will then provide a comprehensive overview of the Government's present programs, in a short and handy format. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth and State Government partners in the NIES network have from time to time considered whether to develop standard packages (or models) of programs for separate industries. The consensus has been that there are too many differences between firms, even within the same industry, for such a broad approach to be worthwhile pursuing. The idea that there is a single ``model'' which can be employed to solve industry's problems is highly seductive. Regrettably, the reality is that a ``model'' in one industry or country is seldom directly transferable to another. </PARA>
<PARA>A better measure of performance and guide to implementing change in an enterprise is what its best international competitors are doing. In order to further advance this notion, the Australian Manufacturing Council is undertaking a study into how Australian enterprises can use detailed comparisons with overseas ``sister'' plants as a way of implementing change. </PARA>
<PARA>These comparisons need to delve into all the relevant factors underlying competitiveness, such as management practices, human resource policies, technology and work organisation. The Global Challenge noted that the most successful firms in implementing change had used these comparisons as a means to build an understanding of both the need for change and its feasibility among employees at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA>The mechanisms of national conferences proposed by the Committee for developing the model are also not considered the most effective means of introducing the changes identified by the Committee as necessary. The Government believes that better and more appropriate ways include one-to-one working with firms and selective networking, and suggests that the key focus for introducing change should thus be on individual enterprises or groups of enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 13</PARA>
<PARA>That the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, in conjunction with peak industry and union organisations, institute a program of overseas visits by representative manufacturing industry groups to study developments in the implementation of new management techniques. These industry delegates should report their findings back to the national/state conferences. Assistance should also be provided to bring experts to Australia to attend the conferences or to address industry directly as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government acknowledges that overseas visits of the type proposed can be very useful. It has already, through the Department of Industrial Relations, part-funded a number of tripartite overseas missions between 1988 and 1990 in the industry sectors of metals, vehicles, textiles, clothing and footwear, timber, meat and food processing. </PARA>
<PARA>While these missions were undertaken in the context of the award restructuring and workplace reform processes, they also examined the operations of internationally competitive best practice firms, technological change, new management techniques and emerging trends in their sectors. The missions were very successful in the impetus and direction they provided to the restructuring process and in developing a common purpose among the key industry partners. It is considered that they have gone a large part of the way towards meeting the objectives incorporated within this Recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>As referred to in the previous answers to Recommendations 6-12, the study by the Australian Manufacturing Council proposes a more focused approach to undertaking overseas missions on international ``best practice''. The AMC study aims to provide enterprises with an incentive to examine and develop ongoing contacts with similar overseas plants. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also an existing NIES program which provides an additional cost effective method of assessing developments in new management techniques. The Integrated Manufacturing Program brings together user groups of non-competing companies to share information on how to introduce best world practice management techniques. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue of Management Education is under active consideration within the Employment, Education and Training portfolio and by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. A preliminary survey of attitudes to time spent on management education amongst senior management across all industries has been completed. A Mission on Management Education in mid-November 1990 visited the USA, Europe and Japan and a report will be available through NBEET in mid 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>NIES is also currently providing assistance to further the dissemination of manufacturing technologies and enhance international industry-academic linkages, with the Fraunhofer Institute for Production, Engineering and Automation in Germany. Since 1989, there have been a series of secondments of Institute staff to the South Australian Centre for Manufacturing, to present seminars and undertake specific company consulting assignments. These secondments are continuing and are expected to enhance Australia's current level of manufacturing technology in the areas of software development, automation systems and advanced manufacturing concepts. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 14</PARA>
<PARA>That the Minister for Employment, Education and Training prepare for presentation and discussion at the first national conference a paper setting out education assistance for manufacturing industry and proposals to ensure its relevance, given the emerging technologies and multiskilling now required for Australian manufacturing to be internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>There are many types of funding for vocational education and training provided by the Commonwealth though DEET and through the State/Territory TAFE systems. The manufacturing sector is a major beneficiary of the various funding allocations. Information in the responses to Recommendations 3,4,and 5 indicates efforts to ensure relevance to industry needs and to promote multi-skilling. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is, however, aware of the need for better information, and new resource materials explaining the intent and extent of training reform are being prepared; they are expected to be available in the second quarter of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>See also the response to Recommendations 6-12. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 15</PARA>
<PARA>That the first national conference be held in Melbourne, as a major centre for manufacturing industry in Australia. The second conference should be held in Sydney and subsequent conferences alternate between these major centres of manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>See the overall response to Recommendations  6-12. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 16</PARA>
<PARA>That NIES streamline and promote the accessibility of NIES offices through the establishment of a well advertised one-stop hotline service which, by having instant access to a wide range of information and databases, will be able to provide immediate and appropriate advice, information and referrals to enterprises seeking assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>For initial contacts by callers, the NIES Business Office in each State or Territory has a one-stop telephone number, which is also supplemented by 008 numbers for country callers in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. In view of the problems encountered by the Committee in contacting these numbers, there will be a review made of how these numbers are answered. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 17</PARA>
<PARA>That NIES augment its role as a national coordinating agency by using data from their evaluation program as a means of determining future directions and operating principles. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The data to be gathered by the NIES evaluation program will be used in determining NIES's future priorities. As NIES is also half-way through its intended operational life, it is presently reviewing its current directions and whether it is meeting the needs of the market. During February, there were a series of seminars in each state, comprising NIES client companies (both successful and unsuccessful), consultants, interested Departments and other interested parties which provided feedback on NIES future directions. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 18</PARA>
<PARA>That firms assess their operations by conducting a diagnostic review, which may indicate a need to develop and implement enterprise improvement plans to improve performance and lead to world competitiveness within an agreed time frame. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government strongly endorses the need for Australian companies to utilise professional diagnostic review as a precursor to adopting best management techniques. In this context, a free diagnostic is a critical first stage in the provision of most NIES services to companies. </PARA>

<PARA>Recommendation and Response</PARA>
<PARA>It is recommended that all organisations, whether they be departments, statutory bodies or other bodies whose reports are tabled in the Parliament, include a check-list of reporting requirements which indicates:</PARA>
<PARA> - whether, in the Authority's view, the guideline or part thereof has been covered and where in the report;</PARA>

<PARA> : omitted due to error or decision. </PARA>
<PARA>The revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports issued in early 1991 include a requirement that annual reports contain an index of reporting requirements.

<PARA>Government Response to the Report of the Senate Standing</PARA>
<PARA>Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs</PARA>
<PARA>Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee</PARA>
<PARA>May 1990</PARA>
<PARA>Schedule of Recommendations and Responses</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Committee endorses the conclusion of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration [SSCFPA] in its report on The Timeliness and Quality of Annual Reports that the guidelines for reporting by statutory authorities are in need of revision. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response to recommendation 3 of the report of the SSCFPA is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government notes that this recommendation has been supported by the Senate Standing Committee (SSC) on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee (May 1990, p.6). It notes, too, that the JCPA has recently reported following its inquiry into annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The task of co-ordinating work on the drafting of new requirements in relation to the annual reports of statutory authorities will involve consultation with a wide range of agencies, taking into account issues raised in submissions to the JCPA on the subject by PM&amp;, the Department of Finance and other agencies, the recommendations of the JCPA, and issues raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration (SSCFPA) in paragraph 3.36 of its own report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees that the primary purpose of authorities in producing their annual reports should be to meet requirements in relation to accountability. The Government will continue its practice of considering recommendations and comments by parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Recommendation: The Government examine the current procedures relating to transmittal of annual reports to Ministers with a view to amending them in such a way as to indicate for the benefit of Parliament the actual date of transmittal. In making this recommendation, the Committee endorses the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration contained in its report entitled The Timeliness and Quality of Annual Reports, namely that the letter of transmittal to the Minister be produced separately to the report. A copy of the letter, dated with the date that the report is actually passed to the Minister, should be sent to the Clerks of each House at the same time as it is sent to the Minister. The Clerks should then table these letters when they are received. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response to recommendation 22 of the SSCFPA's report is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government notes the difficulty which the Committee has had in trying to ascertain when reports were furnished to Ministers. It notes, too, the SSCFPA's reference to this recommendation in its Report on Annual Reports: Reports Tabled July-December 1989 (p.11), and the support for the recommendation expressed by:</PARA>
<PARA> * the President of the Senate, in his August 1990 President's Report on Annual Reports (p. 2);</PARA>
<PARA> * the SSC on Employment, Education and Training, in its May 1990 Report on Annual Reports (the Committee also expressed the view that any letter of transmittal within annual reports should be undated);</PARA>
<PARA> * the SSC on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, in its May 1990 report, Examination of Annual Reports (p. 4); and</PARA>
<PARA> * the SSC on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in its May 1990 Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee (p. 8). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees that agencies and Ministers should be able to demonstrate their compliance with the statutory requirement that reports be furnished to Ministers by a certain date (Acts Interpretation Act subsection 34C(2)) and tabled within a certain period after the date on which reports are received by Ministers (Public Service Act subsection 25(8), Acts Interpretation Act subsection 34C(3)). </PARA>
<PARA> An agency cannot accurately predict how long the interval will be between the date when the text of its report (including any letter of transmittal incorporated in it) is finalised and the date when printed copies are available to be furnished to the Minister. Nor can it be assumed that the date of furnishing will be the same as the date on which the Minister receives a report. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not reports are furnished to Ministers with separate covering letters, there remains a need for each report to incorporate a statement by the agency head certifying its compliance with (e.g.) section 25 of the Public Service Act. That statement should be signed and dated. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports include a requirement (no. 01) that the annual report of a department contain a statement by the Secretary, dated when the Secretary gives the text final clearance to be printed. When the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to including a similar requirement in any new document. </PARA>
<PARA> Agencies, in furnishing reports to Ministers, may if they wish do so under cover of separate (dated) letters. To meet the concerns expressed by parliamentary committees, Ministers, in tabling reports, will advise the Parliament on what date or dates the reports were furnished to and received by them. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Recommendation: Consideration be given to developing separate sets of reporting guidelines for budget dependent authorities and Government Business Enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue of providing guidelines relevant to the range of agencies was among the considerations which were raised in submissions by PM&amp; and the Department of Finance to the JCPA on annual reporting requirements for statutory authorities, and which will be taken into account when the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced. The JCPA has now reported and work is commencing on the drafting of new requirements in relation to the annual reports of statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Recommendation: The guidelines for both departmental and statutory authority annual reports be amended so as specifically to require reporting on the progress of Equal Employment Opportunity programs (even if such a report merely sets out reasons for not pursuing an EEO program). </PARA>
<PARA>The revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports include the following requirements: that departments report on the operation of their EEO plans in accordance with detailed guidelines issued by the office of the Public Service Commissioner (PSC) (page 19); that if any reporting requirement was not applicable to a department during the year this be shown in an index of requirements in its annual report; and that if any requirement was not met for any other reason the reason be shown (page 8). </PARA>
<PARA>The PSC guidelines referred to above are included in the Personnel Management Guidelines booklet, EEO Programs Guidelines 1 and 2 Updated, issued by the PSC in January 1990. These guidelines apply also to a large number of statutory authorities. Certain other authorities are covered by the EEO (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987. The situation is summarised at pages 66-68 of the PSC's booklet. When the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to ways of including appropriate EEO reporting requirements in any new document. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Recommendation: The guidelines for both departmental and statutory authority annual reports be amended so as to require each report to contain a section showing which pages of the report relate to each requirement of the relevant guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>The revised guidelines for the preparation of departmental annual reports include a requirement (page 8) that annual reports contain an index of reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>When the current Guidelines for the Content, Preparation and Presentation of Annual Reports by Statutory Authorities are revised or replaced, consideration will be given to including a similar requirement in any new document. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Recommendation: Appropriate guidelines be developed to govern the preparation of annual reports on the operation of Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that the suggestions for reporting on the operation of Acts put forward by the Committee are generally appropriate, and it has drawn up the following guidelines based (with slight modifications) on the committee's remarks. The guidelines will be effective in relation to reports for 1991-92 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Where an Act requires annual reports on the operation of the Act or part of it, those reports should contain:</PARA>
<PARA>* table of contents;</PARA>
<PARA>* a reference to the relevant legislation;</PARA>
<PARA>* descriptive and statistical material on the operation of the Act during the year, including:</PARA>
<PARA> - an outline of the objects of the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> - information which assists in determining whether the Act is promoting the achievement of those objects;</PARA>
<PARA> - a summary of any relevant legislative amendments;</PARA>
<PARA> - a summary of any relevant judicial decisions;</PARA>
<PARA> - an indication of the level of activity under the Act (for example, the number of cases dealt with);</PARA>
<PARA> - information which shows the resources devoted to administration of the Act and assists assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the deployment of those resources;</PARA>
<PARA> - information which assists assessment of the social and economic effects of the Act and its effects on individual citizens; and</PARA>
<PARA> - if appropriate, a summary of expected or proposed future developments, including any proposed amendments to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>In the preparation of annual reports on the operation of Acts, attention is to be given to clarity of layout. Indexes are to be included if they would make the contents of reports significantly more accessible. </PARA>

<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT, COMMUNICATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE</PARA>
<PARA>REPORT ON THE CANBERRA LEASEHOLD SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories is pleased to announce the Government's response to the Recommendations contained in the Report on the Canberra Leasehold System tabled in November 1988 by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. With the introduction of self-government in the ACT in 1989 and the confirmation by the Commonwealth that it would retain both the ownership of land in the ACT and the leasehold system of land tenure, the relevance of the Report to the Commonwealth's interests has diminished. </PARA>
<PARA>Four recommendations remain of continuing relevance:</PARA>
<PARA>* Recommendations 3 and 4, which recommend fixed term leases 99 years renewable without further premium for residential leases, and 99 years or shorter terms as appropriate with negotiated renewal and further premiums for non-residential. The ACT (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 provides for leases to be for specific periods rather than in perpetuity. Acceptance of these recommendations is considered highly desirable in the interests of avoiding undue speculation and achieving orderly development and redevelopment. </PARA>
<PARA>* Recommendation 6 which proposes that lease administrators should take the initiative in relation to redevelopment in the Territory, rather than be reactive. It is important that Territory legislation does not impede the Commonwealth initiating redevelopment proposals in areas of Territory Land formally designated by the National Capital Plan as being of national significance. </PARA>
<PARA>* Recommendation 11, which seeks active enforcement of lease purpose clauses. Within Designated Areas of the National Capital Plan, such enforcement is considered critical to the effectiveness of the Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>A similar Report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has been referred to the Chief Minister for the ACT with the Commonwealth's views for consideration by her Government and the ACT Assembly as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>Comment</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>1. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth retain ownership of land in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 confirms the continued ownership of ACT land by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Accept. Substance of this recommendation already given legislative force. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The Committee affirms the view that the leasehold system of property tenure provides an appropriate basis for land planning and management in the ACT and that it should be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>The above legislation confirms the continued application of the leasehold system. </PARA>
<PARA>Accept. Substance of this recommendation already given legislative force. </PARA>
<PARA>3. The Committee recommends leases should be for a term of years rather than in perpetuity. Residential leases should be for 99 years. Non-residential leases should be for 99 years or for shorter periods and their renewal should be at the discretion of, and on terms negotiated with, the ground landlord, and will include the payment of a further premium. </PARA>
<PARA>Continuation of a fixed term lease system is provided for by the above legislation and is considered appropriate. This is the best method of avoiding undue speculation by land-holders and achieving orderly development and redevelopment. Leases in perpetuity would effectively be little different to freehold, and would give rise to an altered level of expectation on the part of the lessees. </PARA>
<PARA>A fixed term leasing system is provided for by the ACT (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. This system is considered a basic essential to Canberra's orderly development. </PARA>
<PARA>4. The Committee recommends that the City Area Leases Ordinance be amended to provide for the renewal of residential leases at the end of 99 years without further charge. </PARA>
<PARA>The principle is supported. Lessees of residential leases should on expiry of their leases, be able to continue in occupancy without significant cost implications. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>5. The Committee recommends that lease purpose clauses in leases under the Ordinances be treated as both instruments of land use control and parts of an agreement. Administration and planning should be closely related to one another and coordinated. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth's interest in land use in the Australian Capital Territory will in future be safeguarded through the National Capital Plan and the provisions of the ACT (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. It is considered appropriate that the ACT Government should decide whether to continue utilising Lease Purpose clauses as the means of controlling land use or whether to tie the purposes to which a lease may be put to the uses permitted (for the time being) by the Territory Plan, or within Designated Areas, the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>Except with regard to the National Capital Plan, It is agreed that lease administration and planning should be carried out by a single authority. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>6. The Committee recommends that the authority responsible for lease administration, in close cooperation with the proposed Territorial Planning Authority, should take the initiative, rather than being reactive in relation to redevelopment. </PARA>
<PARA>Within Designated Areas of the National Capital Plan, the Commonwealth via the National Capital Planning Authority may well wish to initiate redevelopment rather than await action and react to private sector initiatives. It is important therefore that the ACT Government does not enact legislation which would threaten this capability. </PARA>
<PARA>Accept. However action by the ACT Government should not impede the Commonwealth initiating redevelopment in Designated Areas of the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>7. The Committee recommends that approved policy plans and development plans should be binding on the planning and development authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Transitional Provisions of the ACT (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, this recommendation is given effect to. This is an interim situation only. The NCPA (and all authorities and bodies of both governments) are bound not to act in any way inconsistent with the National Capital Plan. There is currently no legislation binding Territory Authorities or bodies to the Territory Plan. The stature of the Plan and the credibility of the legislature and its servants would be enhanced if such a provision was made. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth and Territory are bound by the National Capital Plan. The ACT Government might consider the extent of binding of the Territory Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>8. The Committee recommends that implementation of land development by the private sector must be closely monitored and its effects carefully assessed by the ACT Administration. </PARA>
<PARA>No comment. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>9. The Committee believes that the current methods of amendment of lease purpose clauses under section 11a of the City Area Leases Ordinance are unsatisfactory and recommends that they should be replaced by surrender of the existing lease and the grant of a new lease for the new purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Lease surrender and the granting of a new lease are considered to be appropriate techniques to replace the current method of varying lease purposes, provided opportunities for public objection are not curtailed. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation is properly one for the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>10. The Committee recommends the current 50 per cent betterment levy should be replaced by compensation to the lessee for the value of the lease that is surrendered, including improvements, and a charge of the full premium value for the grant of a new lease together with the cost of any necessary off-site services. </PARA>
<PARA>Arguments advanced by the for this recommendation are compelling and are supported. Revenue from the administration and management of Territory land is however a matter which can only properly be considered by the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>11. The Committee recommends that the lease administration section of ACT Administration should take action against lessees who breach the purpose clauses of their leases. </PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly a matter which should be addressed by the ACT Government. Within the Designated Areas of the National Capital Plan, the Commonwealth (through the Designated Areas of NCPA) will require prompt and effective action in relation to breaches of purpose clauses where this would result in any inconsistency with a provision of the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>Accept. The Commonwealth will require prompt action in relation to breaches of lease purpose clauses in respect of Designated land in the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>12. The Committee recognises that there are benefits in simplifying leases. However, the Committee recommends that in the process there should be no weakening of safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA>Territory Government's proposed planning legislation includes appropriate safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>13. The Committee recommends that the development rights of some of the older existing leases need to be defined more precisely. </PARA>
<PARA>14. The Committee believes there should be opportunities for public participation in planning decisions not only when draft policy and development plans are being prepared but also when specific decisions are being made to change lease purposes or to grant leases on unleased land in established areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 25 of the ACT (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 sets out requirements for Territory Planning legislation which include procedures for ascertaining and considering the views of the public. Within the constraints of the Section, and also s. 29 which deals with administration of Territory land, this recommendation is properly a matter for the ACT Government to consider. The principle of public participation in planning matters is well established. Care should however be exercised to prevent successive and repetitive `bites of the same cherry' and to ensure that conflict can be resolved with some expedition. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government within the requirements set down in the ACT (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>15. The Committee recommends there be a legislative requirement for proposals for surrender and a new grant to be publicly notified (Section 11a CALO). They would be considered in the first instance by the planning and leasing authority. Its decisions would be subject to objection or appeal through the AAT. This procedure would apply to leases under any of the four lease ordinances. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever method of land use change is adopted, it is important that appropriate public processes are adopted. As for Recommendation 9, it is for the ACT Government to establish appropriate procedures to apply to Territory land. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>16. The Committee recommends that the financial terms and other conditions of leases granted under Section 17 of the City Area Leases Ordinance or under Section 72a of the Real Property Ordinance should be on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA>This is strictly a matter for the ACT Government. Making such matters part of the public record would clearly be in the interest of open Government. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>17. The Committee recommends that the ACT Administration publish a booklet which sets out the features of the leasehold system, explains the rights and responsibilities of lessees and provides an introduction to the areas of the department responsible for the various aspects of leasehold administration. This booklet should be made freely available. </PARA>
<PARA>The ACT Government now has responsibility for the management of Territory Land. Recommendations 17 and 18 are therefore no longer relevant to the Commonwealth's interests. </PARA>
<PARA>A matter for the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA>18. The Committee, therefore, recommends that within one year the ACT Administration report to both the Senate and House of Representatives Standing Committees on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on how these recommendations are operating. </PARA>

<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT, COMMUNICATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE</PARA>
<PARA>REPORT ON:</PARA>
<PARA>ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL FOR A VERY FAST TRAIN</PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>The Government welcomes the Report prepared by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on Aspects of the Proposal For a Very Fast Train, released on 13 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government believes that the rail industry has an important role to play in the development of a more efficient and competitive land transport sector; one in which road and rail perform efficiently the tasks to which they are best suited. This approach enhances the efficiency of our transport system and the quality of service it provides, as well as minimises the environmental impacts of transport activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal for a Very Fast Train, representing a major, privately-financed venture in the rail industry, is viewed by the Government as an exciting initiative in the development of land transport. </PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, the Federal Government has worked closely with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT in an inter-governmental Task Force to evaluate the VFT proposal. The principal requests made of the Governments by the VFT Joint Venture would involve government acceptance of the justification for the project, of an inland, rather than coastal route, of various performance criteria and of particular processes for the assessment of the environmental impacts of the VFT. </PARA>
<PARA>However, before Governments decide on these issues, there is a more fundamental threshold issue and this concerns the taxation treatment of the VFT. The VFT Joint Venture has proposed that there be changes to the tax system to assist the financing of the VFT and to remove a perceived tax bias against infrastructure projects, such as the VFT, which involve large construction costs and a deferred flow of revenue. A Committee of Ministers, of which I am a member, has been formed to examine the taxation issues and will shortly be finalising its considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report on Aspects of the Proposal For a Very Fast Train emphasises that while the Committee views the development of the project favourably, in a very general sense, it has not been called on to examine the economic or financial viability of the project, nor to comment on the taxation issues which are fundamental to the project proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA>While the discussion on the VFT in the media has focused on taxation and financing issues, the concerns of the community have been wider. Indeed, there can be few projects which have engendered such public interest and debate as the VFT. The Committee's Report examines many issues which are of great interest and importance in this debate. The Committee's considerations contribute significantly to the understanding of complex matters such as noise levels and noise standards, energy use and atmospheric pollution, land acquisition, alternative high speed rail technologies, the impacts of a VFT on land use and the possible effects on regional development. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has made several recommendations on which I would like to comment:</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation (Chapter 1 paragraph 1.26)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the guidelines governing the content of the Joint Venture's environmental impact statement be exposed in draft form for public comment for a period of six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that the environmental impact statement (EIS) guidelines should be exposed for public comment before they are finalised. A period of six weeks would be appropriate given the magnitude and complexity of the project and the degree of public interest. The public review period would, however, need to be agreed between the four relevant Governments-the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation (Chapter 1 paragraph 1.38)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth give priority in its negotiations with the Joint Venture to establishing what protection for the Commonwealth is feasible should the project fail in the construction phase. In addition, the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth ensure that wide publicity is given to its position that there will be no Commonwealth subsidy to, or rescue of, the project if it runs into financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth considers that a formal agreement between the four governments and the Joint Venture would be required to suitably limit governments' financial exposure and the degree of government liability for the project. Such an agreement has already been considered by the inter-governmental VFT Task Force. The Government agrees with the Committee that one possible means of minimising the risk to taxpayers funds would be to insert in such an agreement a clause similar to that in the English Channel Tunnel Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation (Chapter 2 paragraph 2.59)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the economic and technical feasibility of a fast freight train sharing part or all of the VFT alignments should be examined as a matter of urgency in the context of the overall proposals for an FFT. The economics of governments paying for the cost of reducing gradients to levels acceptable to the FFT should be considered if it proves impractical to have the FFT use VFT gradients. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government appreciates the detailed discussion by the Committee regarding the possibility of a shared alignment for the VFT and a fast freight train (FFT) between Sydney and Melbourne. However, any future upgrading of the Sydney-Melbourne line, including reducing gradients to levels appropriate to an FFT, would be a matter of commercial consideration by the future board of the National Rail Freight Corporation, and the Victorian and NSW rail systems.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation (Chapter 3 paragraph 3.113)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the governments responsible for setting and enforcing VFT safety standards be required to approve, on safety grounds, any proposal to use the VFT corridor for pipelines, communication cables, electricity transmissions lines, or similar utilities. The power should exist to permit sharing only on condition that specified safety precautions and procedures are observed. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>It would be desirable to ensure that any proposal to share the VFT corridor is examined and evaluated according to international rail safety standards by an independent party-further comment, relevant to this issue is provided below in response to the recommendations in Chapter 6. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation (Chapter 5 paragraph 5.58)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that the basis, reasonableness and adequacy of the noise standards proposed by the Joint Venture for the VFT project, and not merely the question of the VFT's compliance with those standards, should be open to public scrutiny either prior to, or as part of, the EIS assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The VFT Joint Venture's proposed noise standards are outlined in its VFT Project Evaluation report (November 1990), with supporting documentation in a consultancy report provided in February 1991. There has been no agreement given to the proposed standards which are at present under consideration by the four governments. The Government agrees that noise standards applying to the VFT should be exposed to full public scrutiny either prior to, or as part of, the EIS assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation (Chapter 6 paragraph 6.11)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> - there be uniform safety standards governing the design and operation of the VFT;</PARA>
<PARA> - there be provision for uniform enforcement of these standards;</PARA>
<PARA> - the standards and their enforcement be no less vigorous than those applicable to very fast trains operating overseas; and</PARA>
<PARA> - a cooperative approach to setting and enforcing VFT safety standards be adopted by the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victorian and Australian Capital Territory Governments, but the Commonwealth be prepared to use the powers available to it to act unilaterally if the cooperative approach does not succeed. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that the design and operation of the VFT should be subject to rigorous safety standards, applied and enforced in a uniform manner. Such safety standards would also need to comprehend any shared use of the VFT corridor for pipelines, communications purposes and other uses. All relevant models for the development, application and enforcement of safety standards for the VFT will be examined. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has been, and is, working with the NSW, Victorian and ACT Governments on a range of issues including safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>The Government acknowledges the valuable contribution made by the Senate Standing Committee to the evaluation of the VFT project. The findings of the Committee are being taken into account by the Government in its consideration of the VFT Joint Venture's proposals which the Federal Government is assessing jointly with the New South Wales, Victorian and Australian Capital Territory Governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which I am a member, relates to an important project for Australia and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). I commend the Committee's report to anyone who has not read it. The Government's response is a somewhat more bland document than I would have hoped, although perhaps it goes as far as it can. It refers to the fact that the threshold question still remains: that of taxation treatment for the very fast train project. It also refers to the relationship between the four governments involved and the Committee which has been established to look at those issues. I hope that they are working diligently and will give a high priority to the issues which are relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has responded to the recommendations of the Committee. Again, to an extent, one might say that its responses are bland but hopefully the conclusion, which indicates that the Government acknowledges the contribution made by the Committee in the evaluation and which refers to the relationship between the governments, indicates that priority is being given to that aspect of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the issue of taxation, which the Committee did not have before it pursuant to its terms of reference, I refer to the update document dated June 1991 of the joint venture in which the first paragraph, under `The Challenge to Government' states:</PARA>
<PARA>`Get on' with assessment: The VFT Joint Venture has strongly urged the Federal Government to get on with the assessment of the Sydney/Canberra/Melbourne high speed rail project. Proposals put forward by the VFT have now been with the Government for more than six months and it is now more than two months since a Ministerial Cabinet Sub-Committee was formed to urgently consider a range of key VFT issues. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that the Cabinet has had other matters on its mind, but these sorts of projects must be pursued at the same time. I, too, would urge with the joint venturer that these proposals be looked at, and I am disappointed that the Government has not been able, at the same time as responding to the Committee's report, to respond to these other issues as well. The second paragraph of the VFT update to which I have referred is headed `Australia's Largest Project'. It refers to the fact that it is commercially viable but suffers from discrimination in the tax law. It states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The VFT Joint Venture has demonstrated that a large start-up project such as the VFT is discriminated against relative to other investments. The Joint Venture has proposed changes to the taxation law to remove that discrimination. Recent studies by the Government's own Bureau of Industry Economics support the VFT position. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Government will be imaginative. It is not being asked to contribute money but to look at the tax system in both the short and the longer term as to the benefits to taxpayers from this project and the benefit to Australia as a whole. Initially it was hoped to have the train running by 1995. As we are now into 1991 and still very much at the investigation stage, it would seem that that may not be achievable. It would be a pity if the project were delayed or lost altogether merely because four governments were not able to give it sufficient priority to ensure that what is an imaginative project is able to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to address the Government's response on aspects of proposals for a very fast train (VFT). There have been some interesting articles on the VFT in the Australian in the past week, and I commend the Murdoch press for giving space to both sides of the debate for a change. Obviously, the VFT is still a very contentious proposal, but the current argument is really over the consortium's plea on taxation treatment. As the response indicates on page 2, the concerns of the community have been wider than the tax issue, which is a legitimate concern in its own right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recent media reports have again questioned the financial viability of the project in light of the reduction in air fares, and again I stress the real question of the financial viability of the VFT given that what we really need is a cheap, efficient interstate rail service designed to serve passengers as well as freight, and the somewhat quicker but more expensive back-up air service between urban centres in the south-east corridor of this country. Australia simply does not need this project because we can cope with transport between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne by reducing road traffic, improving the current rail system and maintaining cheap air fares with appropriate discounts. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to repeat the arguments advanced for all this position because they have been made on several occasions previously. However, I stress the urgent need for an improved rail service in the south-east corridor for both passengers and freight. We do not need this white elephant mega-project, which is dubious on both environmental and financial grounds. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak to this report to draw attention to the problems of small restricted health funds; in particular, the Mount Isa Mines health fund. Reinsurance was introduced by the Fraser Government in 1976 to ensure that no health fund would run into difficulties because of the sudden run on hospital costs. All bed day costs for private health fund contributors who spent more than 35 days in hospital in a year were put into a pool with a government subsidy-$150m at one time-and funds that had a large run on hospital costs received moneys from the pool; those that did not had to pay into the pool. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme worked fairly well until June 1989 when the Government enlarged the pool by allowing funds to include costs for all hospital bed days of insured people aged 65 and over and some ancillary private hospital accommodation costs. Their reasoning for this was to spread the cost of the health of the insured aged across all health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision has proved disastrous for small restricted membership employee based regional health funds, such as the MIM Employees Health Society. The MIM Employees Health Society estimates the cost to its fund for the year 1991-92 will be in excess of $2.5m or 8.15c per family member per week. This money goes directly to subsidise the larger open membership health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been done to counter this increased cost to restricted membership employee based health funds? Individual funds, through their national body, the Health Insurance Restricted Membership Association of Australia, have fought the introduction of the latest changes to the reinsurance concept. HIRMAA continues to lobby for change to the restricted membership employee based private funds and has encouraged its membership to lobby their local parliamentary member for changes to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, legislative changes were delayed by three months and the Government was forced to pay a $20m subsidy from June 1989 to December 1990, but these moves have saved the MIM Employees Health Society $1.52m over that period. However, representations need to be pursued for further changes to occur. With the withdrawal of government subsidy from 1 January this year, payments to the reinsurance pool will increase from about $150,000 to $220,000 per quarter to about $540,000 per quarter. Costs for the financial year 1990-91 are estimated at $1.9m, and for the financial year 1991-92 at $2.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious from these figures that attention needs to be drawn to this particular problem with the small insurance funds which operate on a restricted basis and which cannot cope with the problems associated with the larger unrestricted funds. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Paper No. 3 on today's list refers to a set of guidelines set out by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, its councils and committees in the performance of their functions. The guidelines set out in the paper have three sets of priorities: economic, social and budgetary, and I will speak very briefly on each one. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic priorities include guidelines that are at variance with the legislation which the Minister is rushing through the Parliament. They call for the removal of unnecessary regulations and other impediments remaining central to the Government's approach; yet, we have just finished debating one Bill and are about to debate another, both of which over-regulate and create difficulties for the education industry. I refer to the renamed Education Services (Export Regulations) Bill and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The board is urged by the Minister to be mindful of certain economic priorities: increasing participation in education and increasing opportunities for upgrading skills and retraining. Perhaps this augurs well for the future, but the inquiry into adult and community education by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has found that there are huge problems related to re-entry into education and training courses. It has also found that there is insufficient expenditure on migrant education and a deplorable lack of literacy in this country, which is an indictment on the whole education system. </PARA>
<PARA> The board is urged also to be mindful of improving the efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility of education and training, including training offered by private providers. Yet, later today or tomorrow we will debate a Bill which demands a national unified system of training. So, far from allowing training to be flexible, it confines it to a very narrow definition. </PARA>
<PARA> The board is urged further to help reduce institutional barriers between different educational and training systems. Again, I feel that that is a pious hope rather than a reality. The reality is that there is very poor articulation between different courses let alone between different institutions. Under the heading `social priorities' the Minister states that the Government's fundamental objective is to develop a fair, more prosperous and just society. One of the key elements of a just society, says the Minister, is equity in the distribution of economic resources, but their actual achievement is exactly the opposite: the gap has widened under the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another element of a just society is fair and equal access to essential services, such as education; yet, the Senate Committee inquiry into adult and community education showed that there were still impenetrable barriers for some people to education: barriers such as distance, sex, ethnicity, language and ability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister reminds the board in this document that the Government has substantially expanded the number of places in higher education, but it has done so with disastrous results. The Government has expanded places but without providing sufficient additional resources, so we have universities that are bulging at the seams. Students are accommodated in overcrowded conditions and staff workloads have become impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> The board is reminded that a particular priority for this Government has been to ensure income support arrangements for young people in education, but the recent debate on the Student Assistance Amendment Bill in the Senate gives the lie to this. Students are finding it more difficult to get assistance to pursue further studies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister reminds the board of the Government's priority to improve literacy in this country, but we are way behind. When the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training held hearings recently around Australia, there was overwhelming evidence that not enough resources had been devoted to the literacy problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make two final comments in relation to this document. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) urges Australia to become a clever country, but his Minister for Employment, Education and Training includes not one word in this document about the encouragement of gifted children. Much of the document refers to young people and new programs of assistance for those who are unemployed. It is a sad situation when the Government has to devise guidelines for a national board to cater for a massive high unemployment rate: 27 per cent of our young people are out of work and this document does little to solve their problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>Initially, I would like to congratulate the Auditor-General on his normal excellent report. I think one of the points of which we should be cognisant and which comes out of the report is the Auditor-General's remark that limited conclusions could be drawn from the audits because of the small number of agencies reviewed. I know that a matter of great concern to a number of senators on this side of the chamber is the limited facilities available to the Auditor-General. Hence, his limited coverage of what is a massive department. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is an absolute indictment of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) who, in his administration of this portfolio, has quite clearly shown that he is neither very interested nor capable of handling something which is management oriented. He has shown this in a number of ways. He showed it in his improper interference with a contractor. The Minister came in after a tender had been let and reinstated the tenderer simply on the basis of the fact that the tenderer approached him and said that he had quoted too high a price. This destroyed the credibility of the purchasing function of the Commonwealth, which is of paramount importance, and the probity of contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> As the events of recent days have shown, the Minister used his Department to engage media monitoring consultants for his own political purposes. This is an improper use of such an activity. In fact, I would be somewhat surprised if the Auditor-General, when he has another look at this Department, does not look into this issue itself. Departmental consultants should be used for departmental work, not for political work. Quite clearly, the use of Croll Communications (Australia) Pty Ltd at a cost of some $17,000 or $18,000 a month over the last month just to track media in regard to both the interference in the contract, the advertisement ban and the disclosure provisions, was nothing to do with the Department but simply a political matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has indicated that he has no understanding or much interest in the information technology purchase area. There is an issue at stake, which has been going on for some 12 months now, in regard to the unlimited liability of purchase requirements and the consequential damages requirements. Again, that has not been resolved, although I understand that Senator Button has taken an interest in it in terms of his portfolio. So there might be some hope that this matter will be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the report itself, I would like to cover quickly some of the matters that the Auditor-General has drawn to the attention of this Parliament. In regard to motor vehicle use and disposal, the Auditor-General pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>  The ANAO found inadequacies in the maintenance of records of trips made in Commonwealth vehicles in almost all agencies despite the issue of instructions requiring records of usage to be kept. These problems mainly related to the records not being kept, being incomplete or missing. There were also instances where there was no check of these records to enable the validity of travel to be monitored. </PARA>
<PARA>One cannot run an organisation like that, particularly when taxpayers' money is involved and there is already a suspicion in the community about the probity of expenditure of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General went on to make an incredible statement which covers a whole range of subjects. In fact, I would go so far as to say that, even on this issue, if this sort of report were made about a company in the private sector there would be a good chance that the directors would be sacked and that the shareholders would have a case against their directors. The report also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The ANAO found weaknesses in security over vehicles, vehicle keys-</PARA>
<PARA>the keys of Commonwealth owned cars-</PARA>
<PARA>and credit cards used for the purchase of petrol. </PARA>
<PARA>This raises a big question mark in respect of the extent to which this activity may be being abused. As I mentioned earlier, the Auditor-General has pointed out that he does not have the facilities at his disposal to pursue these matters at great length. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The ANAO found little evidence that the exchange of an existing vehicle or hire of a new vehicle was supported by a needs assessment. The ANAO recommended that the decision to exchange an existing vehicle or to hire a new vehicle be made on the basis of demonstrated need. </PARA>
<PARA>I was greatly concerned about what the Auditor-General had to say in respect of asset recording, control and disposal. These are large ticket items. We are concerned here with taxpayers' money. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>With one exception-</PARA>
<PARA>with one exception only-</PARA>
<PARA>all asset registers examined were incomplete in one way or another. The most common problem identified was the failure to include details of costs and acquisition dates in the register. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have a register which does not record costs or acquisition dates. What sort of business is this? As I have indicated on a number of occasions, Administrative Services is a management portfolio. This Department is responsible for purchasing, selling and maintaining a large quantity of assets of the Commonwealth. Yet, there is no record of costs and acquisition dates. </PARA>
<PARA> On 29 May I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services asking him for details of an asset register. I have had no response. I have not even had an acknowledgment of that letter. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Failure to do so-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to keep a register with costs and acquisition dates-</PARA>
<PARA>make it difficult to report accurately the value of assets in financial statements and to monitor the ages of assets for disposal programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General has used kind words. It is not difficult-it is impossible. The quasi-commercial units in the Department of Administrative Services are moving to accrual accounting. But it is absolutely impossible to set up an accrual accounting system if one does not know the purchase date and the cost of a particular asset. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report is an absolute indictment of the Minister who seems to be more interested in playing party politics than getting on with managing what is probably the most critical department in the Commonwealth in terms of the ownership of assets. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Common to all agencies-</PARA>
<PARA>not just one or two-</PARA>
<PARA>were the following shortcomings:</PARA>
<PARA>* assets being moved between locations without advising the area responsible for the maintenance of the asset register</PARA>
<PARA>* poor asset descriptions-</PARA>
<PARA>another kind phrase which means that they are not there and they cannot be recognised-</PARA>
<PARA> and location descriptions which made it difficult to locate/identify assets</PARA>
<PARA>So all of these Commonwealth government assets cannot be located; they cannot be described; they have no value on them; and no-one knows when they were purchased. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA>* assets being disposed of without being retired from the asset register-</PARA>
<PARA>assets which are sold and which are thought to be still on the books-</PARA>
<PARA>* assets being purchased without being entered into the asset register. This situation appeared to arise because of the greater devolution of payment functions to program areas, the increasing use of corporate credit cards to purchase assets and the failure to maintain an audit trail between purchasing and receipt of assets, and</PARA>
<PARA>* asset registers containing a high proportion of items below agencies' minimum value for assets, which ranged from $250 up to $2,000. While some of the items were portable and attractive-</PARA>
<PARA>his word-</PARA>
<PARA> the inclusion of other low value items in the asset register created unnecessary work in maintaining the register and accounting for items in stocktakes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General then went on to talk about stocktakes. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Other problems with stocktaking were as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>and I will not go through the lot-</PARA>
<PARA>* often, the only personnel available to do stocktakes were the same people who maintained the asset register . . . </PARA>
<PARA>An asset register which he described earlier as being totally flawed. He points out, quite correctly, that stocktakes should be carried out by personnel other than those responsible for maintaining the asset records. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of concern relates to time recording and leave records. Of course, the Auditor-General mentioned the vexed question of flexitime which is described by many people-and I know that this was the view of Senate Walsh when he was Minister for Finance-as being one of the great rackets of the last two decades. I think this point was brought out by the Auditor-General when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the ANAO found in some agencies instances where provisions of both the Award and local agreements were not being adhered to. In particular:</PARA>
<PARA>* flex credits in excess of ten hours had been carried over to the following period without evidence of appropriate authorisation</PARA>
<PARA>* core time absence had occurred when officers had not accumulated sufficient flex time, and</PARA>
<PARA>* flex debits were carried out over two or more settlement periods. </PARA>
<PARA>He also pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> The Personal Management Manual states that those officers not subject to flexitime arrangements (i.e. those above ASO 6 not subject to a local agreement) are not required to formally record attendance times . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One does not know whether they are there or not: they are not required to record attendance times. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>for compensation purposes they should record attendance times in a personal diary. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General indicates that the officers falling within that category were generally not aware of this requirement. He spoke at great length about employee rehabilitation and compensation. He drew attention to the fact that there was an incorrect application of the provisions of subsections 19(2) and 19(3) of the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act for compensation for injuries resulting in incapacity, which caused over and underpayments of entitlements, and where calculations of normal weekly earnings were incorrect, resulting in over and under-reimbursements of payments by Comcare. In some agencies, the maintenance of history and leave records were inadequate. Manual history cards and leave records maintained by some agencies were recorded in pencil. When one sees such records in pencil a red light starts flashing. People record things in pencil so they can rub them out, for goodness sake. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of time constraints, I will not go into this in great detail, but I would like to come back to it later. I reiterate that if this were a business in the private sector it would almost certainly have not survived the recession. Also, with an audit report such as this, the directors would be fired. The chief in all of this is the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus: that is where the buck stops. He is totally responsible and has to accept the blame for this. If this were a company there would be a good chance of the shareholders suing their directors for not managing it properly.</PARA>
<PARA> The proper management of an operation is more important in the public sector than it is in the private sector, because in the public sector taxpayers' money is being used. We are taking money off taxpayers. Just as an anecdote, a small businessman who spoke to me only last week was subject to a tax audit. He said to the tax auditor, `I do not mind you coming in here and learning all about my business. You know more about it than I do. But I would like to know what you are doing with my money. If I can satisfy myself that you are using my money in a proper way, that will be okay'. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a quite curious situation of the Government taking a consuming interest in the affairs of everyone in the private sector, including honourable senators, in regard to the proper return to the Government of tax revenue, and an abuse of that money in its expenditure. It is my view that the Minister has a lot to answer for. Maybe he would be better off going to a department which he would prefer-as we understand from talk in the corridors-such as the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories or the Department of Social Security. </PARA>

<PARA> The range of services provided includes office accommodation and related services, personnel services for staff employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act and travel services within Australia and overseas. The total expenditure on these services was $112m last year and approximately $123m is estimated for the current financial year. The estimated expenditure for the current financial year for salaries and related costs of ministerial and electorate office staff is about $49m, and $74m for associated administrative expenses, transport and travel costs of parliamentarians and their staff. The amount is considerable, and that is why it is important that the Auditor-General's conclusions be examined very closely by parliamentarians, who are affected by them. The key findings of the Audit report are:</PARA>
<PARA> the existing legislative and administrative framework makes it impracticable for Certifying Officers to establish that expenditure on certain entitlements is in accordance with legislative requirements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly basic problem. The report also found:</PARA>
<PARA> alternative administrative arrangements should be introduced to ensure that the test of `efficient and effective use of public moneys' is applied to parliamentarians' expenditure</PARA>
<PARA> there is a case for enhanced public reporting arrangements to provide more information on the level and type of expenditures by parliamentarians</PARA>
<PARA> guidelines should be developed to define more clearly the conditions for payments of entitlements</PARA>
<PARA> improved procedures are needed to ensure that supplies and services have been received</PARA>
<PARA> the provision of information to parliamentarians should be improved to assist them to manage their resources</PARA>
<PARA> controls over electorate staff travel should be strengthened, and</PARA>
<PARA> procedures for the recovery of expenditure from parliamentarians should be formalised. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this suggests that a fair range of improvement could take place in this area. Nonetheless, the AuditorGeneral finds that there are sound reasons for some limitations on the extent of intrusive examination into payments by and to parliamentarians; although the Australian National Audit Office is concerned-and quite rightly so-that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the terms `parliamentary' and `electorate' and `official business' are not defined in the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal or in the Parliamentary Entitlements Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Nonetheless, the Remuneration Tribunal has given some indication by commenting that, having regard to the broad nature of the activities of parliamentarians:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the scope of the `duties' of parliamentarians would include those activities associated with parliamentary and electorate work but not those which arise solely from a member's personal or social activities, or in the course of activities which are related exclusively to the member's party political matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It would seem apparent from the above that the use of entitlements that are for electorate, parliamentary or official duties should not be permitted for activities related solely to social, party political or personal activities. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, it is difficult to distinguish clearly or systematically those activities which are not related solely to social, political and personal activities. For example, what proportion of the expenditure must be for purposes related to official, parliamentary, or electorate business and not party business before it qualifies for an entitlement? In addition, it is likely that different people have different perceptions about what constitutes parliamentary and electorate business. Recognising that precision is impossible and that commonsense and that good judgment is required, the ANAO considers that there is a need for guidelines to be developed which assist in defining these terms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office also recommends:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that monthly reports of all expenditure, together with the supporting documentation where appropriate, be forwarded to parliamentarians for the purpose of their certifying that expenditure has been used in accordance with legal entitlements and that efficient and effective use has been made of public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that this would certainly dramatise to all members of parliament the fact that they are required to follow the requirements which the Audit Office seeks to have more clearly stated in terms of guidelines. This is the response from the Department to the Auditor-General's comments:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department accepts the recommendations of the ANAO and recognises that, in the absence of the application of the provisions of the Audit Act which deal with the use of public moneys when applying to members of Parliament, monthly accountability statements are desirable. The statements will enable the Department to satisfy its obligations in ensuring that expenditure is utilised in accordance with legal entitlements and that efficient and effective use has been made of public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that one of those uses is postage. For example, there is a clear statement that postage must be used for electorate or parliamentary purposes but not for party business. It would be salutary for some members of parliament that I could think of to be required to certify monthly that all postage from their offices had, in fact, been for electorate or parliamentary business but not for party business. </PARA>
<PARA> On that topic, I hope that the Department, because of its agreement with the thrust of the Auditor-General's report, will promptly respond to the questions which were put on notice by Senator Parer on 28 May. A response is needed fairly soon to be within the guidelines. In particular, these questions go to the heart of some of the problems that seem to exist because of the lack of guidelines and because some members of parliament are, frankly, failing to face up to what should be their proper standards of behaviour. Some of Senator Parer's questions were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Is it a permitted use of official postage entitlements for a Member and/or office holder of the Parliament to distribute: (a) letters soliciting financial donations for his/her political party or its endorsed candidates; (b) letters recruiting workers and assistants for his/her political party or its endorsed candidates; (c) notices of meetings of his/her political party; (d) minutes of meetings of his/her political party; (e) political party promotion material; or (f) how-to-vote material for himself/herself or candidates of his/her political party. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Is it permissible for a Member to give stamps provided under an official allowance to an endorsed candidate of his/her political party or to a third party. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Is it permissible for a Member to allow the use by another Member of Parliament of his/her bulk postage entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA>These things have become very important in view of the Government's attempt last year to increase the postage allowance to $30,000 for members of the House of Representatives but not members of the Senate, and also the proposed increase in the postage allowance to $20,000-odd by the latest Remuneration Tribunal recommendation. Senator Parer's questions continue as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Is it permissible for a Member to mail another Member's mail or the mail of a candidate of his/her political party on his/her bulk postage entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) Is it permissible for a Member to use his/her stationery allowance to produce: (a) fund raising letters or campaign worker recruiting letters for his/her political party or its endorsed candidates; or (b) how-to-vote material for him or herself or candidates of his/her political party. </PARA>
<PARA>(6) What are the guidelines for the use of departmental postage, including stamps, franking machines and bulk postage facilities, including Australia Post credit cards, by Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>(7) Can an assurance be given that these guidelines have not been broken by any Minister of the Hawke Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>(8) Can an undertaking be given to investigate any possible breach of a prima facie case. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the Australian Labor Party's increasing use of direct mail facilities-which seem to be part of the campaign to have the $30,000 allocated to lower House members of parliament-there is a clear and dramatic need, as the Auditor-General says, for clear guidelines to be stated and for the Department to require a regular certification by members that these guidelines, where they exist, are being met. Other matters raised by Senator Parer in his questions on notice are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (9) What have been the guidelines for the allocation of Ministerial offices since the election of the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>(10) Which Ministers have located ministerial offices in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>(11) Is it permissible for Ministers to use departmental resources and facilities for: (a) parliamentary purposes; (b) electorate purposes; or (c) support of political parties and their endorsed candidates. </PARA>
<PARA>(12) In the last Parliament, which Ministers located ministerial offices in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>(13) What resources, in terms of staff and office equipment, and specifically, postage facilities, including stamps, franking machines and Australia Post credit cards, were provided for use in those offices. </PARA>
<PARA>(14) What were the identifying numbers of any franking machines issued to those offices. </PARA>
<PARA>(15) What telephone facilities are provided to Members and for what purposes are these facilities provided. </PARA>
<PARA>(16) Is it permitted to connect equipment to officially provided telephone equipment that has not been officially supplied to the Member, such as modems, direct dialling equipment and equipment associated with tele-marketing and telephone opinion research. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important question raised by Senator Parer because of the concerted campaign that has been undertaken by Government members in this area. The questions continue as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(17) Are Members permitted to allow members of the public or political party workers to use or charge to a Member's official telephone, costs associated with tele-marketing or telephone opinion research. </PARA>
<PARA>(18) Has the Department of Administrative Services identified any over-expenditure of entitlements provided either by the Remuneration Tribunal, the Department of Administrative Services, the Parliament or its departments or a Government, to Members and Senators during the last Parliament; if so, for each case, please provide full and complete details of the over-expenditure, including: (a) details of the entitlement; (b) the nature and amount of the over-expenditure; (c) the name of the Member or Senator and, if applicable, the electoral division involved; (d) any action initiated to recover the over-expenditure and the result of the action initiated; and (e) the status of the recovery action or an explanation as to why no action has been taken. </PARA>
<PARA>Because, in general terms, I welcome the Department's support for the propositions of the Auditor-General about the requirement for certification and the need for guidelines, I hope that the Department will speedily provide an answer to the Minister for Administrative Services to these questions on notice, and that the Minister will then speedily convey that answer to the Parliament rather than delay or defer it or, as we have seen in the past, seek to cross out those bits which happen to embarrass him. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning Senator Michael Baume raised a point of order in relation to a remark made by Senator Bolkus. Senator Baume stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>My point of order is that it is improper to describe any member of the Opposition or indeed any member of this place as being someone who should be treated with contempt. I therefore ask the Minister to withdraw his comment.</PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of the point of order raised by Senator Baume, I ruled that there was no point of order. Although many honourable senators would not refer to other honourable senators as being deserving of contempt, I do not regard this as offensive in the context of standing order 193 (3). There is often a fine line between what a person in political life should be able to accept as part of the cut and thrust of politics and what should be regarded as offensive in the chamber. While, for example, I would not regard the use of the word `contempt' in the context raised by Senator Baume to be objectionable, I would regard as objectionable a remark that an honourable senator is `contemptible'.</PARA>
<PARA> After ruling that there was no point of order this morning, I immediately called for a transcript of the incident because, due to a barrage of interjections, I was not exactly sure of what Senator Bolkus had said. After receiving and reading the transcript, I still hold that my ruling in relation to the point of order raised by Senator Baume was correct. Again, I mention that Senator Baume remarked:</PARA>
<PARA>My point of order is that it is improper to describe any member of the Opposition or indeed any member of this place as being someone who should be treated with contempt. I therefore ask the Minister to withdraw his comment.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus's comment, however, went further than this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Parer can throw around whatever allegations he likes; I am not going to respond to him. I will treat him with the same contempt with which he handles truth in this place.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no hesitation in remarking that Senator Bolkus's comment linking `contempt' with `truth' was a personal reflection on Senator Parer. This part of Senator Bolkus's remarks was definitely in breach of standing order 193 (3).</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see any useful purpose in pursuing the matter further, but I consider it is a matter I should bring to the attention of the chamber, especially as someone reading Hansard may gain the incorrect impression that I regarded that there was no point of order in relation to those words which linked `contempt' with `truth'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill and allied Bills was adjourned for the matters of public interest discussion, I was pointing out to the Senate the duplicity of the Australian Democrats in relation to matters rural. I had mentioned their general anti-rural stand, the stand on which they were now vacillating in relation to wool, and I had mentioned the matter of political broadcasts. The Democrats, in their anti-rural bias, are proposing such things as a wealth tax, an inheritance tax, an extension of the capital gains tax, increased excises on petrol and diesel fuel, a levying on all domestic road freight movements, changes in the pay as you earn deduction procedures which would impose further burdens on employers, increases in company taxes, and the taxing of trusts as companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to their attitude to the rural and farming people, the Democrats have introduced a private members' Bill, which I suspect should properly be called `the invitation to strike Bill'. That Bill will take away any remedies that rural people might have against the likes of, say, Wally Curran, who has closed down meatworks in Victoria. It makes something of a mockery, I suggest, of the Question Time exchange on the live sheep export matter when the Democrats are agreeing and saying `hear, hear' to the fact that we should kill and abattoir the sheep within Australia and get the value added component of that. Of course, the Democrats want to take away any legislation that exists that will stop the sorts of strikes and actions that Wally Curran has instituted in Victoria to prevent rural people from slaughtering and abattoiring sheep in this country. The Democrats generally have this anti-rural, anti-farming bias. As I said this morning, how can anyone support the actions of a party which is so blatantly anti-farmer and which is so desperately trying to hide its anti-rural base?</PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out earlier that the short-term political actions which only provide ammunition for the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to cling desperately to power do not interest me at all. I, together with my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties, believe that it is in the best interests of Australians generally, and of canegrowers in particular, that the Liberal and National parties be united in their determination to defeat this Government that has done so much harm to rural industries in general and to the sugar industry in particular. In this regard, I congratulate and support the speeches given by my Queensland colleagues in the other place, namely, Mr Bruce Scott, Mr Braithwaite and Mr Truss, and I join with them in their attitude towards these Bills before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is essential that we have a credible voice in the next Government which will ensure that the real interests of canegrowers and the industry that supports so much of Queensland, particularly north Queensland, are encouraged and enhanced. I intend to continue to support the sugar industry against the attacks on rural people and farmers that the Democrats are renowned for. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see, over a period of time, whether Senator Kernot acts properly in the interests of rural industries. I understand from the former and now discredited Treasurer, Mr Keating, that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) jumps whenever the American President picks up the phone. I suppose it would be too much to expect the Prime Minister to consider Australian producers rather than American interests when jumping to the American phone calls. I wonder whether the Prime Minister has ever seriously done any tough bargaining with the Americans and the Europeans on the huge subsidies that they pay to their sugar growers. If he were as good at getting deals out of the Americans as he is at getting deals out of the ALP Left and the Democrats, then rural exporters would be prospering. I wonder whether the Prime Minister has ever proposed any joint action with the Cairns Group against the Americans and the Europeans which might lead to some fairer world practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Access to European markets for our sugar in a free, open and competitive system would mean that Australia could always sell at very good prices as much sugar as it could ever produce. Australia essentially is a trading nation. Whereas the United States exports about 15 per cent of its produce, Australia exports 65 per cent. With only a minuscule population by world standards, we must export to survive. It is essential that we redouble our efforts to achieve freer world trade. Because of our reliance on our exports to survive, a freer trading regime is much more critical to us than it is to most other countries. The changes contained in this legislation go some way to addressing that and they will send a message to our trading partners that we are serious about stopping unfair trading arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I have lived in a sugar town for most of my life, and whilst I am not a cane farmer I am the only one in this chamber whose livelihood has depended upon the returns gained by the sugar industry. I know of the calibre, energy and efficiency of the people who are involved in the sugar industry. I know all the cane farmers, the contractors, the mill workers, the field workers, the sugar chemists and the mill engineers. I know their commitment to the industry they serve. It is operated by a group of people who have proved over the years their resilience, their ability to adapt to new procedures and new practices and their innate ability to work and create wealth for Australia. There is no nine to five existence for these people or any handout for overtime, whenever a few extra hours are worked. </PARA>
<PARA> Principally, sugar cane is grown by people who came to this land from another country with not a penny to their name, often without friends and without experience of the harsh and difficult environment in which they found themselves. Often, they were not familiar with the language of the country. However, they had a complete and absolute willingness to work to better themselves and their families in a new land-a land which they saw as a land of opportunity. These people will adapt and progress, despite the lies and broken promises of this Government. They will cope because that is the sort of people they are. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry in Queensland has been the most important continuing industry of coastal Queensland and has led its development and progress this century. As time goes by, it is my view that the major sugar growing areas of Queensland will contract to three parts of the State-the Ingham area, the Burdekin area and the Mackay district. Both State and Federal governments have a massive investment in the Burdekin area, with their inputs into the Burdekin dam and the infrastructure that supports it. </PARA>
<PARA> Individual families and the CSR company have invested a great deal of money in that area as well. The climate is ideal for the growing of sugar, a guaranteed water supply is there, the land is plentiful and available, and the complete infrastructure to produce the world's best and highest yielding sugar is also available. The tonnages per hectare grown in the Burdekin area are amongst the highest in the world. Mackay, further to the south, is also a very rich growing district. It has the climate and the infrastructure, but it does suffer from the lack of a guaranteed water supply- relying mainly on rainfall, which is cheap and nutritious but not always there when it is wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, because of the floods and then droughts earlier this year in the region, the crop in the Plane Creek Mill area could be as low as 500,000 tonnes compared with 1.3 million tonnes in a good season-a yield of 46 tonnes per hectare or some 55 per cent only of the normal average. The full potential of the Mackay district will be reached only if a permanent water supply can be provided to that area. The Herbert River district also has been hard hit by natural calamities. The floods earlier this year will mean a loss in sugar production of an estimated $30m to the Ingham area. Yields in part of the Hinchinbrook district will be the lowest for 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia (Senator Collins) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to initiate talks with the Mackay Regional Water Resources Committee and the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries in an effort to speed up planning and assessment of appraisal studies for future water storage in the Pioneer Valley of the Mackay district. I also call upon them to consider some contribution to financing a total catchment management project in the Herbert River area to enable some relief from the flooding and drainage problems that that area experiences. The Commonwealth Government must extend its support to projects which will enable the Mackay and Ingham regions to continue to enhance their role as major producers of export dollars. Some support by the Australian Democrats for these initiatives would be a far more genuine and telling indication of their support for the sugar industry than the transparent actions they often go on with. </PARA>
<PARA> A secure water supply to Mackay, drainage and flooding relief in Ingham and the expansion of the industry in the new areas served by the Burdekin Dam will enable the Australian sugar industry to continue its role as one of Australia's biggest and best export earners. But, more importantly, when this Government has had the courage to tackle reforms of the labour market and transport industries and has purified the world sugar markets, it can reduce tariffs as much as it likes, because in that situation the Australian industry will not need any protection; it can and will compete with and dominate any other sugar industry anywhere else in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it three Bills: the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and the Customs Amendment Bill 1991. Time is short, as it usually is at this time of the session, given the Government's inability to manage things properly. If it cannot run a country, it certainly cannot run a Senate chamber. I see the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who is on duty, acknowledging the correctness of that statement. Since time is short, I will deal only briefly with the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill and then say a few words on the other Bill before us. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill has eight schedules in it amending rates of tariff, and the Bill amending the Customs Act deals mainly with anti-dumping procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make a general point first in relation to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. It has to be seen as part of the Government's headlong rush to zero tariffs. There is quite a revolution going on in Australia with the Labor Government busy stripping tariffs off everything. That is causing a very high price to be paid by Australian manufacturing industry. Many people are going out of business because of the rate of change and the lack of coherent policies associated with those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is jobs for Australians within a sustainable industrial operation. By that I do not mean the potentiation or perpetuation of the tariff regime we had in the past, because it was clearly wrong and something had to be done. Tariffs started to increase in this country in the 1950s and the 1960s. When I came to the Senate 13 years ago, the average level of tariff protection across industry was 30 per cent. I spoke quite strongly about levels of tariff protection 13 years ago in the Senate chamber in the other Parliament House at a time when it was very unfashionable to talk about tariff protection and the need to reduce it. The problem with the tariff protection that we had in those days was that it was extreme. Residual elements still exist in Australian industry. The textile, clothing and footwear section of the manufacturing industry enjoys a tariff protection of between 80 and 120 per cent-it is hard to define. The motor industry has tariff protection levels between 60 and 80 per cent. Those levels reflect the great imbalance in the policy of 30 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We paid a very high price for that unbalanced tariff protection because industries became inefficient. It did not matter how bad management was; they could get away with bad management practices, secure in the belief that they had only to apply for an increase in tariff protection to shut competitors out of Australia. We saw the most outrageous moves on demarcation and union practices, all paid for by the tariff barrier. At the end of the day, we had a totally inequitable distribution of resources. Resources went into those industries which could attract the highest tariff protection, irrespective of the value to Australia in terms of employment and in terms of export earnings. The situation became so bad that the whole thing collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> Remedial action has been taken during the time of this Labor Government. But it has adopted a very unthinking knee-jerk reaction to the situation. It has taken the point of view that, since tariffs are wrong, we must get rid of them. A much more analytical response than that is required. A little intelligence needs to be applied. As well as asking what is wrong, we have to ask why it went wrong. The solution to the tariff problem in Australia requires far more elegant and sophisticated approaches than we have seen from this Government, which has just been blindly winding back tariffs as fast as it can. </PARA>
<PARA> What was wrong with the old system was the extreme level that it went to, and the correction of it quite properly is the reduction and, hopefully, the elimination of tariffs, but we cannot make those corrections in isolation and still maintain industries in Australia. We need to develop an effective, efficient and, above all, competitive Australian industrial base producing goods that we can sell on world markets. The first thing that has to be done is not to chop the tariffs off but to fix the great inefficiencies in the Australian community that the industrial world has to cope with and to clean up those inefficiencies before we start going to zero tariffs. The Government has done nothing effective at all to reform Australian work practices in this regard. It has certainly talked a lot about it but, as we see from the debacle on the waterfront, it has done nothing to lead to a more efficient Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Only today in the Australian we see an article headed `Industrial action brings Newcastle company ``to its knees'' '. It is an article about a dockyard in Newcastle which is $465,000 in debt for damages because it is 32 days over its contract time for the refit of a Royal Australian Navy ship. In the past week at Bundaberg, one of the towns in my own State, two engineering companies gave evidence to the Industrial Relations Commission that they had export orders of $3.5m and over 100 jobs in jeopardy because of union warfare against them. The union there is the same union that is causing trouble in the dockyards in Newcastle. It is the old metal trades group of unions. They are as greedy and as intransigent and lawless a bunch as we would get outside the painters and dockers. This Government will not do anything to clean up the union movement, to bring it under the rule of law and say, `You have a national responsibility to the people of Australia. You have fair terms and conditions to work under. Abide by those'. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the work practices in Australia, not only at the dockside but across the wharves, through the transport industry and all the rest of it, are cleaned up, we simply cannot go to zero tariffs, because we leave Australian industry labouring under enormous penalties which make them uncompetitive, resulting in their going out of work. We have to maintain the life raft in some way until we get the people on the raft onto dry land. We will not get them to dry land until we clean up all the union featherbedding and union malpractices that this Government is paralysed to act against. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Industry Commission looked at the effect of work practices within Australia and estimated that a figure of some $2,300 a year per family in increased spending was to be gained in the short term if we just cleaned up the inefficiencies within the society. That means around 50,000 extra jobs, and in aggregate around $22 billion a year, if we start to run the country efficiently. That is very much a function of the government of the day, standing up to the pressure groups and the special interest groups which deny the workers and the ordinary people of this country the standard of living that they are entitled to just by having an efficient society. Until that is done, a lot of this business of reducing tariffs only means that more and more Australians are put out of work. When the Liberal-National Party comes into government, whenever the election is held, that will be our top priority. We will fix up the inefficiencies and get rid of people like Mr Kelty and all the other people to whom Senator Cook, who has just come into the chamber, kowtows. Those people have no place in a modern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill in schedule 8, by amendments 7 to 12 which amend schedule 3 of the original Bill, deals with the sugar industry. It is a matter on which I wish to speak because it has occasioned quite a lot of comment within this chamber. Once more it is an example of a broken promise by this Government. It gave a solemn promise to implement the findings of a Senate committee on the levels of tariff protection for the sugar industry over a number of years as a consequence of the removal of the embargo. The Government, without any warning at all, has gone and broken those undertakings. As Senator Macdonald in an excellent speech pointed out, one needs lead time and warning because it is a cycle of about 18 months in which a grower can make his decisions as to when he will plant, what he will plant and finally reap the crop. To make a spontaneous decision in the way the Government did here to change the rules of the game has a profound impact on the growers and millers in the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to have Senator Macdonald in the chamber with me. I have had a lifelong association in the sugar industry with growers, millers and marketeers. I would immodestly claim to have closer links with the industry than anyone in the Senate. I welcome Senator Macdonald, even if he was only a solicitor in a sugar town! But at least it puts him a long way ahead of some of the other people in this chamber today who have spoken on sugar. He has a far greater insight into the industry and its ramifications than, I suspect, do some of those who will follow me and some who have spoken earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry is interesting because it is very tightly controlled. I do not think there is any industry that has ever existed in Australia which has had a similar degree of regulation on every aspect. I refer to assignments as to where one can grow cane, the entitlement to the mills, the way the product is all bought by the Queensland Government and so on. It is all marketed in a certain way and, as I have said, it is a tightly structured industry. In the past it has had the ultimate in tariff protection. It did not just have high tariff barriers; it had a total prohibition on any sugar imports into Australia. If ever there were a formula for inefficiency in an industry, it would have to be the sugar industry. It is the exception that proves the rule in one sense because, despite the huge and inflexible degree of protection that it has enjoyed in the past, it is a world leader. It is an industry that sells 80 per cent of its product overseas on world markets at world prices, in good years and bad years, and it makes a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lesson here. The business of tariff protection is not to be seen in isolation, but in the context of the efficiencies within the industry. In 1989 the Government removed the embargo and agreed to a transition period in accordance with terms laid down by a Senate committee. It agreed to provide tariff protection of $115 a tonne up to July 1991, $95 to July 1992, and $70 from July 1992. Now, without warning, the figure has gone down to $76 a tonne to July this year, and $55 a tonne from July 1992. This is a clear break with the undertakings given by the Government to the industry. The decision will cost growers a great deal of money. It was entirely unnecessary. I believe that it is entirely unjustified, and it is an enormous injustice to the whole of the sugar industry, but the matter cannot be changed. We are dealing here with a taxation Bill under section 55 of the Constitution. All the protests from the Australian Democrats and the other people who will move amendments are cynical political exercises, because the Government will not change its mind on this matter and we will achieve nothing by voting against this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I say with some regret that the community will pay the price, but if the people vote a Labor government into power they have to pay the price of the economic mismanagement of the Government. The people who will pay the price in this instance will be the growers and millers in the sugar industry. Their real solution to the problem is to take action at the polls the next time they get the opportunity and vote out this Government lock, stock and barrel, as it deserves to be voted out. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another element of this Bill that is of relevance to this point, and that is the takeover bid that is now before the Australian financial world for Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd. Bundaberg Sugar is a very successful, very old, very well managed company, which I think is the largest company in Queensland, and one of the large companies in Australia. It is a grower, a miller, a refiner and a distiller. It is second only to CSR and produces about 22 per cent of the Australian crop. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that it was a very well managed company, and in times like this where everyone is feeling the pinch financially, as of 30 April 1991 Bundaberg Sugar had $40m in cash in its accounts. It is not a bankrupt company at all. It is extremely well managed. Yet it has been subjected to a very opportunistic bid from an English sugar company. I mentioned that Bundaberg Sugar was Australia's second largest sugar company; it is also Australia's largest sugar grower. It owns six raw sugar mills-Fairymead, Bingera, Millaquin, Mourilyan, Moreton, Babinda, and it also has a refinery at Millaquin. It has a half-share in the Bundaberg distillery which makes the famous Bundaberg rum, the only spirit of any international standing that is produced in Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An excellent drop. The fundamental problem that Bundaberg Sugar faces is that it operates in a deregulated market. It is being attacked in a predatory takeover by a company operating within a very protected market. When a company is working on the world market and is deeply involved in that market as Bundaberg Sugar is, when there is a surplus of the commodity the price comes down and therefore the profitability of the company falls, even though it is extremely sound and well managed. Conversely, when a company is operating within a highly protected market in which the price never falls-and the price of sugar in England where Tate and Lyle PLC operates is roughly three times what it is in Australia today-the company is completely insulated from any downturns in the market. It is very much stronger than a company that is exposed without any protection to the world market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the problem Bundaberg Sugar faces at present. It is at a low point through world prices being low and it is exposed to an opportunistic bid from a predatory operator in Europe. Its correct defence should be to say to the Australian Government, `Look, we are important to Australia. We produce a commodity which we can sell and sell very readily overseas. Exports are crucially important to Australia's financial health, and we should be defended because we can contribute far more to the Australian economy by retaining the profits within Australia as an Australian owned company than being taken over by a foreign company.'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very valid and respectable argument to be made that Bundaberg Sugar is important strategically to Australia's financial health, but what happens? It gets referred by the Government to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which is purely a toothless tiger, a political front put up by the Government to assuage or mislead the unthinking element in Australia that somehow or other this Government will protect Australia's vital interests. In reality, the FIRB has never taken on any takeover and denied it. </PARA>
<PARA> What is even worse, we had Mr Hawke and Mr Kerin prejudice the findings of the FIRB by going public with opinions before the FIRB report came down. Mr Hawke showed his great knowledge of the sugar industry by saying that Tate and Lyle would bring in some research to Australia. That is an absurd proposition because the Australian sugar industry is the world leader in research and applied technology. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the sad things about this takeover bid is that since every unit in the Australian industry contributes to research funding, the findings are distributed within the Australian sugar community. One object of Tate and Lyle in its takeover bid is to gain access to that world standard technology which is held within Australia; our technology is ahead of any other country in the world. Mr Kerin, who also knows as much about the sugar industry as Mr Hawke, then came in and said, `If we get Tate and Lyle in there, it will open up new markets for Australia.'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in good years and bad we sell 80 per cent of the Australian crop on world markets. Even in bad times we are not left with any sugar that carries over from year to year. Where will the markets come from that Tate and Lyle is promising or that Mr Kerin has promised us? It is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The real reason why the Government told the FIRB to approve the Tate and Lyle takeover is that it is desperately short of money. We are going into debt at a rate of something like $1.5 billion-$1,500m-a month on average. We have gone from a debt of about $30 billion to about $128 billion or $132 billion under the economic stewardship of this Government. The Government has to sell the farm. It has to sell everything it can in this country to get money coming in to try to balance the huge outflow. That is why it wants the $325m from Tate and Lyle. It takes the short term view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly not in the national interest that Bundaberg Sugar should be sold to an overseas company. Even the Queensland Government recommended very strongly-as strongly as it could-that the bid not be proceeded with because there was no national advantage in it. We have it on the record that the company is a proven price rigger. It admits to having been involved in price fixing rackets in the United Kingdom for four years. Senator Button smiles; of course as a friend of the Prime Minister it would not affect his morality that someone was involved in dishonest practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that in an unqualified way; it was a slip. We have a proven price rigger in the company and we have a company that has a very poor investment record. According to a report in the Australian Financial Review, one of the directors who came out here as the bagman for Tate and Lyle, Mr Kerr Muir, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . to remain competitive Bundaberg would need the most efficient technology, and Tate and Lyle could provide the necessary expertise and financial support. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Anyone knows that we can all do better and can gain from introducing innovative world-leading technology, which costs money, which we're prepared to spend.''-</PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, this company has $40m in cash. Few companies in Australia today have $40m in cash in hard times. We can raise the money within Australia and the company can raise it within its own resources. But Tate and Lyle's record of investment is on the public record. According to Mr Brian Frith, writing in the Business Australian on Tuesday, 23 April 1991, one of the reports on Tate and Lyle indicates:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that Tate &amp;Lyle's capital expenditure in the UK over the past five years is only one third of British Sugar's-</PARA>
<PARA>which is a competitor of Tate and Lyle-</PARA>
<PARA>#57.8 million . . . to #187.9 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, Tate &amp;Lyle admitted that its UK cane sugar refineries were run down, in need of capital expenditure of at least #100 million to bring them up to modern standards. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very interesting point because Mr Frith then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite this, Tate &amp;Lyle directors actually reduced budgeted expenditure this year-</PARA>
<PARA>on capital equipment. So we have a company that has a pretty poor record of investment within its own industry and a company whose policies are inimical to the stated goals of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why the Government is reducing tariffs is to free up trade around the world-to reduce barriers. Yet this same Tate and Lyle refused take any action in the recent past when it had the opportunity to free up the prohibition on the importation of sugar into the European common market. It refused to take any action against the stringent policies in the United States on the importation of sugar. Those two actions alone put it markedly at variance with the stated policies of this Government. If the company has anything to offer the sugar industry in Australia, it should come out and say so. There has been nothing on the public record yet that would encourage anyone to believe that there was anything beneficial in the Tate and Lyle bid for Bundaberg Sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who will really suffer at the end of the day will be the growers. There has always been a traditional rift in the sugar industry between growers and millers; they are two sides of the one coin. There have been differences of opinion over the years between the Bundaberg millers and growers, but that is true throughout the whole industry. The growers will certainly find it much more difficult to deal with a board that is situated in London and oriented towards the European common market than some board that is situated in Bundaberg where they can physically walk in and discuss their differences. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I will deal very briefly with the other Bill, the Customs Amendment Bill 1991, which changes the legislation with respect to those who are entitled to carry out body searches and authorises Federal Court of Australia judges to be signatories to that warrant. That is something that, on this side of the chamber, we would support. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the Customs Amendment Bill concerns some minor changes to the anti-dumping legislation. Anti-dumping legislation becomes of less relevance the lower the tariff barriers in a country. In that sense, the importance and urgency of anti-dumping legislation is lessened with the shifts we have seen in recent years. Nevertheless, it is important that the country does have protection against dumping. It is an extraordinarily difficult field from a legislative point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, I spent quite a bit of time looking at this two years ago when I was shadow Minister for customs. I came to the conclusion that the principles we follow in this country are wrong. Here we require proof to be established within Australia that dumping has occurred. Dumping is defined as taking place when the products of one country are exported to another country at less than their normal value in the country of export. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements in Australia are laid down in two stages. Suspicion of dumping has to be established over a period of a number of days first of all, and then we have to actually prove over, I think, 180 days that the goods were sold in Australia at a lower price than in the country of origin. The great difficulty with that is that, first of all, a lot of time is involved and in that time the company, companies or industry being affected by dumping can succumb. The other difficulty is that it costs a great deal of money, and that cost is borne by Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a preferable approach, where reasonable grounds exist to believe that dumping has taken place, is to require the importer to show that the goods are not being marketed in Australia at a value lower than in the country of origin, and put a prohibition on sales in the Australian community until that takes place. With those comments, I wish the Bills a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak particularly to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, which proposes to implement a number of alterations to the structure of tariffs in Australia. I want to focus on reductions of tariffs on primary products, in particular on sugar, and the ramifications of these reductions for the sugar industry in the State of Queensland, which I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other speakers, especially Senator Boswell, have adequately-indeed passionately-explained why we believe it is shameful that the sugar industry has been singled out for particularly harsh treatment. I say this because, along with others, I believe that the industry is entitled to operate in a climate of certainty. With respect to telecommunications, we are told repeatedly by this Government that the foreign second carrier is entitled to operate in a climate of certainty, and much of the legislation was arranged so that that could happen. Why can this not happen in our own sugar industry?</PARA>
<PARA> This industry previously had firm undertakings on tariff rates to apply in 1991-92 and 1992-93, pending an inquiry by the Industry Commission. The Government's actions in proposing this Bill presuppose the results of the inquiry and, I believe, are a slap in the face to the Commission. The readjusted rates, introduced without consultation, will cost an estimated $16m in 1991-92 and $11m in 1992-93. Such losses will have grave economic and social impacts on the Australian sugar industry and on Queensland in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the state of the industry at the moment, we can see that raw sugar prices on the international market are currently at approximately US8.5c a pound, compared with a figure of US16c a pound 15 months ago. The world price of sugar has dropped by a larger percentage than the drop in the wheat price in the last 12 months. That is something that we have all expressed some concern about. The sugar industry suffered from severe crop losses for the 1990 season. Queensland canegrowers expect a further drop in income, conservatively estimated at $200m, from this season's weather-affected crop of 23.93 million tonnes and from lower world prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is currently facing a further crisis of confidence from a major takeover bid by the overseas multinational company, Tate and Lyle, with no government guarantees. I, too, would like to speak about that for a moment. Canegrowers, the peak body representing the nation's 6,000 canegrowers, asked for assurances from Tate and Lyle about such things as the future structure of the industry as, indeed, I believe they should. As honourable senators know, under the terms of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, the Treasurer must be satisfied that the foreign takeover is not contrary to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet Tate and Lyle is a company with significant sweetener and sugar interests in the United States of America and Europe. It is the European Community in particular which is supporting its primary producers with substantial subsidies. I think it is reasonable to assume that Tate and Lyle's Australian operations would be less profitable than its European beet sugar industries. If Tate and Lyle were to prohibit or regulate competition between its various subsidiaries, this would certainly damage severely Australia's desperate efforts to increase exports. This is quite the opposite of what the Government claims it wants. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday, in response to a question from Senator Spindler on this takeover, Senator Button, on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), tabled the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA>To tighten foreign investment policy across the board would have an adverse effect on the long term direct foreign investment necessary for Australia's future growth and development, the creation of jobs, the restructuring of the economy to make Australia competitive internationally and improved living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask, as previous speakers have also asked: how can it possibly be in the national interest to threaten the livelihood of Australia's 6,000 canegrowers and their families, and the provincial cities which rely on primary industries? That is real job creation for you! How can it be in the national interest to approve of a takeover which has the significant potential to decrease, not increase, exports?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government's large scale foreign investment, which translates into 40 per cent control of Australia's productive capacity, does not lead to improved living standards as the Government claims it does. Just ask the pensioners and families who can no longer afford to pay property rates on the Gold Coast because of the unfair escalation of property values there as a direct result of speculative foreign investment. Improved living standards for them means having to leave an area in which they chose to live. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Labor Government, in another show of window dressing as I have referred to before, expressed its concerns over the proposed takeover, but when the crunch comes what can it do? I think it could more seriously argue with the Treasurer and the Foreign Investment Review Board instead of resorting to its standard response of feigned concern, knowing that in the end the Foreign Investment Review Board will make the ultimate decision. The Federal Treasurer should reverse his decision, as the takeover is quite clearly not in the national interest. But I guess when the Government is desperate because its policies have led to extraordinarily high current account deficits and foreign debt burdens, anything goes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald, who has special responsibility for northern Queensland and who lives in a sugar producing area, said in the debate that he will be doing all he can to ensure the best solutions for the sugar industry. He said that he would maintain his close association with the industry to give it a credible voice in the next coalition government. The Australian Democrats are offering Senator Macdonald the opportunity to do both-to ensure the best solution and to maintain his credibility, which I understand is very much at risk here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats' solution, by way of request, is to make sure that the tariff arrangements which were set down prior to the industry statement are maintained, so that the industry can continue to operate in that environment of certainty. But Senator Macdonald has adopted the classic stance so loathed by the general public of speaking of his great concern and then refusing to vote to confirm that concern. That is why at all of the rural rallies we have been to in Queensland the rural community has invariably said, `The coalition offers us no hope either. It is just as bad as the Government'. Senator Macdonald's cowardly action in not supporting the Democrats amendment will simply confirm that view. At least the National Party puts its vote where its mouth is. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald, in his usual Democrats bash, said that this Democrats amendment was a short term political action. He is right. We want to maintain an agreed level of tariff until 1993 so that the longer term process can continue in a way the sugar industry accepts. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macdonald also said that he could not support any action by such an anti-rural party as the Democrats. This is a weak excuse, and Senator Macdonald would know that. He knows that the canegrowers will not accept it. What is more, he is wrong about the Democrats rural policies, but the coalition continues to vexatiously misquote them. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite that, rural people are not believing the Liberals. Deputations to us from rural Australians about Austudy, assistance for isolated children and the level of foreign investment in the beef cattle industry confirm this. Last night, and today, the Democrats have received many telephone calls and faxes from woolgrowers. Let me quote from one or two of them to indicate to Senator Macdonald just how wrong he is. The first fax is from a wool growing family in Western Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>Congratulations Democrats. Please continue to `keep the bastards honest'. Rural Australia needs you like no-one has before . . . Rural Australia is crying out for decent representation and you can give it. </PARA>
<PARA>The next, received just before lunch, is from the New South Wales Farmers Association. It states in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The Association and many woolgrowers are aware that the Democrats, over the last two years, have been the wool industry's most consistent supporters . . . Over the last two years woolgrowers have been fortunate to have the support of the Democrats on a number of important issues. This we very much appreciate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that it is time for some members of the coalition to change the rhetoric. It is not inconsistent that we should continue our support of primary industry by moving our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the cooperation of Senator Boswell in this respect. I know that he would like to have moved the amendment himself. Senator MacGibbon's comments regarding it being a lost cause to vote against the tariff changes in the sugar industry are misleading. The Senate may not amend the Bill but it may request the House of Representatives to amend it, and this is precisely what the Democrat amendment provides. The Senate can reject these changes. In this case, I believe that the Liberal Party needs to put the interests of the Australian sugar growers ahead of spurious selective arguments and Democrat bashing and vote to assist these growers by supporting our request. </PARA>
<PARA> We must oppose these accelerated reductions in tariffs for sugar because, while the international market remains corrupt and subject to massive interference by all the world's exporters, Australia must have a protection level sufficient to ensure the survival of an `efficient by world standards' regional sugar industry and, by extension, the communities reliant on those industries. Any substantial reduction of tariff levels, as foreshadowed by the March economic statement, will expose canegrowers further to these corrupt practices. At a time of relatively high unemployment, it could be said that other sugar exporting countries are, in effect, exporting unemployment to countries such as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government should abide by its agreement with the industry of tariff levels at $95 from 1 July 1991 and $70 from 1 July 1992, and it should reconsider tariff levels on completion of the current Industry Commission hearing into the sugar industry. In closing, I quote from that interesting article from the Weekend Australian of 15 June headed `A road to recovery from our market-led malaise' by Mr C.D. Kemp, founder and former Director of the Institute of Public Affairs. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Reductions in protection, if persisted with, should proceed cautiously, and the thoroughly absurd objective of eliminating all protection in the near future removed from the national agenda. </PARA>

The new-found National Farmers Federation agenda in respect of tariff has been adopted by the Liberal Party: the graziers' agenda; the one dictated by the shadow spokesman, who is a very wealthy man and tells people, `I came into politics to fix a few things and if they do not like me or what I do I will go back, because I am a very rich man, thank you very much, to what I was doing before; politics can take me or leave me'. This graziers' agenda, dictated by people such as this for the Liberal Party, which is lacking totally in understanding of Australian industry, and imposed for the time being on the Liberal Party until it finds out a few political and industrial realities, is accepted at the present time by a significant group in the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What did members of the Liberal Party say in the House of Representatives about the question of tariffs on sugar? They said absolutely nothing. Their spokesman was entirely silent on this issue. All he contributed in the course of debate about these Bills in the House of Representatives was this catchcry that the dumping mechanism should be speeded up. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come to that matter in the committee stage, because Senator Bishop parroted the Opposition's spokesman's words in this chamber and we will have to deal with that in the course of time. That is all he said: he talked about speeding up anti-dumping measures and the question of bounty thresholds. That was a great contribution to an industry debate in the House of Representatives from Mr `Squire' McLachlan, behind whom all of these people, such as Senator Olsen, Senator Durack and Senator Parer, follow like sheep, which is what Mr McLachlan has been used to all his life. They are sheep following Mr McLachlan down to the woolshed where he gets rid of all the problems by sacking a few shearers and then he goes back to his mansion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Olsen says that it was wrong. When asked whether his Party would do these things if ever elected to government, Mr McLachlan said, `Read my lips', which is what was said by President Reagan. But will it have the guts to deliver that in government? This is the crisis of the coalition. The Liberals can easily mouth these things in opposition, but will they have the guts to do it? On their record in Australian politics to date the answer is no, because they have never done anything about it. When the Nationals start giving them a bit of stick, if they ever get into government, off they will go again with the Nationals to the watering hole. Today this coalition is added to by the Australian Democrats in pursuit of their own grubby little political motives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very nasty word to use about anyone. The honourable senator who comes from the `keep the bastards honest' Party does not like being described as grubby because that Party is so pure! The Democrats have no political motives at all in relation to any of these matters. It is all directed at purity. I understand that, but that is just not the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A few matters were mentioned by honourable senators in the course of this debate, particularly amendments to be moved in the committee stage of this legislation, and I will refer to those. First, Senator Bourne of the Australian Democrats raised a couple of queries in relation to the import credit scheme for textile, clothing and footwear industries, which the Democrats have indicated they will support. If Senator Bourne is concerned about those matters, it is probably better for me to deal with them in committee. Senator Olsen, who was in the chamber for a brief time, raised a question about the consultation process that took place in relation to the import credit scheme. If required, that matter can be dealt with in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say something about the question of the anti-dumping changes made in the industry statement, because Senator Bishop addressed this question. She made the same speech as that made in the House of Representatives by Mr McLachlan, who said virtually nothing else in relation to these Bills. As for the Opposition's concern about the question of reducing time for dealing with anti-dumping complaints, let me say that the Government is not at all opposed to reducing the time for dealing with anti-dumping complaints. We would like to have them dealt with within a week, if possible, but of course the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) anti-dumping code, with which we comply, requires that after an application is received a decision must be taken to initiate the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon is right when he says that this dumping issue is very complex. I agree with him. When a prima facie case is made out, under the GATT code and in accordance with decisions of the GATT anti-dumping committee, the investigation period must provide all interested parties with at least 30 days to prepare and lodge a submission and they must also be given the right to consider and comment on a submission from any other party. That is what the GATT anti- dumping code requires. So the Opposition's suggestion about reducing that period to 55 days is just impractical. I do not disagree with the spirit of it; it is just impractical. It cannot be done consistently with the GATT anti-dumping code. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been waiting breathlessly for months for the Senate Standing Committee report on this issue! In fact, the Government said that it would address any further issues required to be addressed following the publication of that report. Let me make the point at this stage that the timeframes in Australia for dealing with these complaints compare favourably with that of other major users of anti-dumping measures, such as the European Community, the United States and Canada. As I have said, I concede that this is an extraordinarily complex and difficult issue, but the spirit of the GATT code is to ensure that people, whether they be importers or producers, get a fair go in the process. The provision of a fair go is not always consistent with the greatest possible alacrity, which we all might desire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Generally speaking, there has been a wide range of discussions in the course of this debate. I have listened avidly to everything that has been said, and I thank the Senate for its consideration of these Bills. During the committee stage there will be an opportunity to deal with these issues at greater length. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to look at the second reading amendments. I read them once before and thought there was not much substance in them. However, I thought I should come back to them because some of them arrived as late as today. I have referred to the question of the time taken for dealing with dumping complaints. An amendment has been moved on behalf the Opposition about which I will say a couple of words. The woolshed agenda is tied up in the Opposition's amendment. It says that the Government has broken commitments by failing to promote full and effective competition in telecommunications. </PARA>

<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill epitomises the Government's failure to deliver an economic environment which would allow a revitalisation of Australian industry, in particular because it:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is obsessed with an ideologically based commitment to deregulation and competition in circumstances which are contrary to the public interest;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) is pursuing a foreign investment policy against the long-term interests of Australia; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During my speech in the second reading debate, I drew the Senate's attention to the guidelines for the various textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) programs, particularly the import credit scheme, and to the fact that the criteria for these guidelines had been circulated on a somewhat selective basis to certain companies. This had been drawn to our attention when some concern was expressed at this particular practice, which I would not have thought was normal government practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are seeking an explanation from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) as to why, in this instance, the draft guidelines should be given to only selected companies to comment on, because that might create an advantage for those companies in due course. Those companies may have had the capacity to be able to influence the guidelines so that in due course they might be making some application to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce under the TCF import credit scheme. Therefore, I specifically ask the Minister: who was responsible for the decision that the draft guidelines should be selectively canvassed? Was that a direction from the Minister or was it taken solely by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assumptions underlying that question are not quite correct. The industry has a representative association which is the peak textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry association. The draft guidelines were sent to all the associations that represent the companies in their dealings with governments. They were sent to unions, general employer associations and some selected companies which are major exporters of TCF items. They were sent to the representative bodies of all companies and to the major companies which are, in fact, exporters as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an industry involving many small firms which are totally domestic in their orientation. The main intention of the distribution was to seek timely and quick comment from the industry and to facilitate the introduction of the scheme on 1 July 1991. That was the desired objective. We were trying to cover a cross-section of the information on value adding and export in the industry. During this consultation process not only were the draft guidelines sent out but also officers of the Authority, the Australian Customs Service and the Department were made available to discuss the proposed import credit scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Olsen's question is based on a company saying that it did not get a copy of the guidelines, I can understand that that is a possibility, but the problem should have been rectified by the industry association of which that company is likely to be a member. </PARA>

<PARA>The effect of this amendment is to maintain the level of tariffs at the pre-industry statement level. As I and other speakers have canvassed in our contributions to the debate, we think that it is imperative that the sugar industry be allowed to continue to operate in a climate of certainty. We think it is unfair to change the rules without consultation. We think it is discriminatory to single out the sugar industry in this way before the findings of the Industry Commission report into sugar are made known. As the Government persists with its dismantling of all tariffs I think, in all fairness, that it should do it in a way that the industry understands and accepts. I take this last opportunity to appeal especially to those Queensland Liberal senators who have spoken in this debate with some passion and concern, to put their vote where their mouths have been in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this amendment. In fact, it was my intention to move an amendment in exactly the same terms as this Democrat amendment. I support the amendment for the reason that a commitment was given by this Parliament that certain tariff levels would continue until 1992. The tariff agreed upon by this Parliament was $95 a tonne, reducing to $75 a tonne as from 1 July 1991, and then from $70 a tonne down to $55 a tonne after 1 July 1992. The other commitment that was given was that the tariff levels would then be the subject of an Industry Commission inquiry. Unilaterally, without any consultation with the industry, the Government moved for the reduction in tariffs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well for Senator Button to wax eloquently and say that farmers do not need protection and that, under the present Government, exports have expanded, but maybe Senator Button can answer this question: how does he expect the Australian sugar growers to compete on the world market when every other sugar cane growing country in the world has a domestic price? For the Economic Community it is $551 a tonne; Thailand, $447 a tonne; and the United States of America, $357 a tonne. Yet, Senator Button came in here some months ago and said that Australian sugar growers had excess protection under world tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> That is simply not true. It opens up the question of how Australian rural producers can maintain productivity when the rest of the world is so heavily subsidising commodities that the world price is reduced, by corruption, and that world price then becomes the Australian domestic price. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button is asking Australian producers to accept the world price of $230 a tonne with a 21 per cent subsidy, when the rest of the world has subsidies of over 100 per cent in some cases. It is just not practical to expect our farmers to stay in there, when all the other sugar growing countries are subsidising their farmers through various means, whether they be export subsidies or production subsidies. The price on the world market is falling and has fallen to $230 a tonne and yet our industries are expected to take that price while the rest of the world has a domestic price. The sugar cane growers are prepared to accept that. Reluctantly, they were prepared to accept the terms and conditions of the parliamentary inquiry and then take their arguments and concerns to the Industry Commission inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the commitment that Senator Button gave-in fact, it was given by everyone in the Parliament when the legislation was passed. It was a commitment that Mr Kerin gave on behalf of the Government. When Mr Kerin was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy he gave that commitment to the sugar cane growers, and yet Senator Button comes in here today and pulls the rug right out from under them. On the world scene the price has fallen from 14c a pound to 8c a pound, mainly due to the corruption of world prices. Yet the Minister expects canegrowers to be able to compete against the rest of the world, when the rest of the world is subsidising their sugar cane growers. I do not believe that we have any alternative other than to support the Democrats amendment, because it relates to a commitment that was given by this Parliament and by every party in the Parliament. </PARA>

Senator Boswell has to work out where his argument carries him. He says that everybody gave commitments here. What happened? He knows the truth about what happened.

It is no good coming in here and arguing for a retention of existing levels of assistance in an international market which is subsidised to the extent that he claims when those levels fall far short of the levels in the rest of the world. The logic of his argument is that the level of assistance for the Australian sugar industry should be going up-not staying where it is now-to follow the rest of the world.

Export subsidies and production subsidies are essentially about export industries, which I concede can be damaging to Australian industry in the world market scene; there is no doubt about that. However, he has to consider what the mechanisms ought to be if he wants to achieve the result which he claims he wants to achieve. You say that the sugar industry is a great export industry. What you are arguing for is protection of a domestic industry, which is not the best way to go, if I might be so polite to say.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he is not desperate at all; but the canegrowers are, in the light of what is being offered here. I thought that somebody who is as interested in the sugar industry as Senator Button would have known that it is the efficiency, the productive capacity and the good performance of Australia's canegrowers which has made them competitive at the tariff level of 21 per cent and not the need for the sorts of subsidies that are needed internationally. I thought that Senator Button would have been the first to congratulate our efficient producers in that regard. They do not need the tariff levels that Senator Button was suggesting they might be insulted by. The subsidies that are needed are those which applied before the industry statement. That is all that is being asked for; that is what would satisfy the canegrowers and that is what they are capable of competing with internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the slight that the Australian Democrats had not made any contribution on behalf of any of the other domestic producers, I would have thought that somebody who was interested in this area-the Minister-would have been interested enough to pay attention to the contribution by Senator Bourne in this place. He will find in her contribution considerable reference to another example, the textile, clothing and footwear industry. That is not something which has gained the Democrats' interest only recently. In fact, an examination of our policies would reveal to Senator Button that we are prepared to support any Australian domestic industry with tariffs and subsidies or whatever else to enable those industries which are environmentally sound, sustainable and useful to Australian society-in a number of definitions-to compete with any other industries which are either subsidised or able to compete with our industries internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that should not have escaped Senator Button's attention is the reference that the Democrats have made over the past several months to the sorts of exploitative practices which are engaged in overseas. These practices bring to the shores of this country products which have been produced by exploited workers, people who do not work for award wages, and products which do not provide fair competition. They may provide what Senator Button calls a level playing field, but they do not provide a fair playing field of competition. I stress to honourable senators such as Senator Macdonald that our policy and our actions in this place support those who contribute to Australia's welfare and Australia's future. I see the canegrowers as playing a very important part in Australia's future. </PARA>

The contributions of Senator Kernot, Senator Boswell and Senator Bell have been influencing me to vote for this amendment. But I ask the Minister: what has motivated the Government to undo this arrangement, this commitment, a year earlier? Why not deal with this question in 1992? The canegrowers understood that they would be safe with subsidies until 1992. Why do it in 1991? Why not attack the problem in 1992, by which time the Industry Commission would have made its recommendations? Thus the Government would have honoured the undertaking given by this Parliament, as Senator Boswell said. Why now and not 1992?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I echo Senator Harradine's question. It also puzzles me why the Government has decided to make these changes ahead of the scheduled time-ahead of the date on which the Industry Commission is to make its report. I query what value there is in it. Senator Button always talks about people on this side being action-men and he-men. I suppose Senator Button must be the he-man doll of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button made certain comments about Senator Boswell. He said that Senator Boswell failed by 179 per cent. It is not Senator Boswell who fails by 179 per cent. It is, of course, Senator Button's colleagues who fail by 179 per cent. Senator Button and his colleagues have had eight years to do something about reducing the world level of subsidy and tariff protection. If anybody can do it in the Government, I am sure that Senator Button can, but it is a little absurd to expect Senator Boswell who sits on the Opposition benches to be able to reduce the tariffs. The real question is why Senator Button's side of the chamber has not done something about the level of international tariffs. That is the crux of the matter, not what Senator Boswell has done. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech Senator Button said that it was appropriate that we do something about the cost of processing industries. But when will Senator Button, as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, do something about the really hard issues? When will he get stuck into the hard issue of industrial relations reform? He dismisses the matter as an SPC magic wand, but Senator Button has yet to grab the magic wand in his hand and give it a try. He likes waving the magic words around, but let us see him try to grab the magic wand and run with it for a little while. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government cannot make any comment about improving industry while it fails to attack the key area of industrial relations reform. My point is that we will be quite happy to see some reductions in tariffs at the same time that Senator Button attacks the area of biggest inefficiency in Australian industry at the moment, namely, its shoddy, poor, lackadaisical industrial relations policy. I and many other senators on this side of the Committee would expect Senator Button, as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, to have some sort of input. I am sure Senator Button would not tell me that he has no input. We value his contributions to the Government much more highly than that. But we want to know why nothing has been done about that area either. </PARA>

<PARA>Once again, I canvassed at length in the second reading debate the reasons why we would be moving these amendments in the Committee of the Whole. Given the hour, I will not canvass those in detail except to say once again that we believe the measures proposed by the Government discriminate against small business operators. We do not believe that is an appropriate, fair or reasonable position. We believe that everyone in the marketplace ought to be treated fairly and equitably and that we should not have a provision that discriminates against small operators and manufacturers in this country. Principally, that is the reason for the amendments being moved. As I said, in the second reading debate I canvassed in detail the reasons and rationale behind the amendments being proposed this day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay honourable senators about these amendments. The Australian Democrats and the Opposition are united on them. However, there are two observations I would make about them. First of all, the administrative arrangements are costly in terms of paying small amounts of bounty to a whole number of recipients. I have been in places where people who are not serious operators have almost complained about getting a form from Customs saying that they are eligible for a bounty and that they should fill it in and send it back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What happened here was that members of the book industry made some complaints about this bounty threshold issue. They were quite justified in their complaints and the Government accepted their view. But it is another matter to take that view and apply it to a whole lot of industries such as the machine tool industry. The argument is essentially about new entrants to an industry. I understand that; it is a sensible enough argument. We do not want to choke off new entrants. But if any of these industries which have a level of technological sophistication and capital equipment requirements and so on are to do anything successfully, a $200,000 threshold, as would apply here, is not serious because we are talking about small milk bar proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the Government's arguments. I do not want to delay the Committee because these amendments will be carried. We have lived without bounty thresholds of this kind for a long time and we can live without them again. In an administrative sense they are difficult and wasteful of the time of people who might otherwise be employed in more productive efforts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first Bill in this allied debate is the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill amends the Health Insurance Act, the National Health Act, the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act. The amendments to the Health Insurance Act and the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act seek to make more information about nursing homes publicly available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three further categories of information will be released directly to the public. First, there are plans submitted by proprietors of actions to be taken to satisfy standards. The majority of nursing homes have no problem with this provision because quality care is, and always has been, their objective. However, it is unfortunate that the structure of funding has placed undue stress on nursing home proprietors and staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The other categories of information to be released include the basic descriptive information concerning each nursing home, such as its name, address, number of beds, fees charged and the action taken or intended to be taken to suspend or revoke the approval of a nursing home, vary the conditions of its approval, cease benefits for new admissions or remove its exempt status. I seek assurance from the Government that appropriate appeal mechanisms are available, in the first instance, to a proprietor who is not satisfied with the information supplied about the nursing home and, in the second case, prior to the publication of other information about ministerial action and other information about the nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports the technical amendments made to the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act. There are a number of minor amendments to the Health Insurance Act, and the coalition supports these. One of the amendments closes a loophole which has recently been exploited by some medical practitioners. Accounts and Medicare benefits will only be claimable for a service where a physical attendance on a patient occurs and a clinically relevant service takes place. The Bill will also require the proprietor of a pathology laboratory, the approval for which has been revoked, to take a number of steps to advertise that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 5 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. One of the noteworthy amendments is to the administration of the individual patient usage (IPU) scheme. This scheme has been in operation for 10 years and covers situations where drugs which may be beneficial to a patient but which are not marketed in Australia are to be used following approval under the IPU scheme. The legislation will decentralise the process and allow individual medical officers to undertake the same decisions as the current therapeutic goods administration officer in Canberra. This should mean a speedier process for all involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the coalition supports this proposal, it does not believe it reaches the heart of the problem-and that is the Government's inability to restructure adequately our drug approval process. Given the number of reports undertaken over the years, we can only hope that the Baume inquiry is fruitful and that some action is taken. The coalition supports the other changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act, which will lead to an overall decrease in bureaucracy associated with the procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill we are debating is the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill. The amendments to this Bill relate mainly to reservations expressed by the coalition and the Australian Democrats at the time of the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Act. The Minister responsible for the legislation might remember-if he were here, that is-the concerns that were expressed. Basically, they relate to the grouping of therapeutic goods together where they share common characteristics or where they share both common characteristics and a common manufacturer. I conclude my remarks on this Bill, given the time constraint, and just indicate that the coalition supports it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill seeks to make three major changes to the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits program. First, it seeks to restrict eligibility for drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits program to Australian residents. Secondly, it seeks to implement a pseudo voluntary pharmaceutical eligibility checking mechanism by installing an on-line dedicated computer link between the Health Insurance Commission and pharmacies. Thirdly, it seeks to make it compulsory for pharmacists to make their claims for payment under the pharmaceutical benefits program through the computerised claims transmission system, which is already used by approximately 80 per cent of pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> I will speak about each of these initiatives in turn, but I will concentrate on the eligibility checking mechanisms because of their intrusive and universal nature as well as the considerable doubt that exists about the savings the Government envisages will be derived from them. Firstly, I speak with respect to restricting the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) to Australian residents. The coalition supports the Government's proposal to restrict eligibility for the pharmaceutical benefits program to Australian residents. It brings the program into line with the Medicare program, and it quite rightly prevents illegal migrants and visitors from receiving concessionary pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that $6m will be saved by restricting concessionary access to Australian residents. When questioned in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the Health Insurance Commission claimed that this estimate was based on an assumption that there are about 200,000 non-residents in the country at a given time and that these non-residents are half as likely as residents to access the pharmaceutical benefits program. </PARA>
<PARA> As was stated in the minority report of the coalition senators, which was tabled in the Senate yesterday, we consider financial estimates which are based on assumptions like these to be entirely inappropriate. The importance of this matter should not be understated because all Australian residents can be asked to provide identification to their pharmacists in order to prevent the system from being rorted by non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major concern the coalition had, relating to this part of the Bill as well as to the pharmaceutical eligibility checking proposal, was the Government's attempt to try to force pharmacists to charge a Commonwealth price when dispensing pharmaceuticals to non-residents and any other people who are not entitled to concessions under the pharmaceutical benefits program-that is, people who cannot get their identity confirmed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased that the Government has foreshadowed an amendment that acknowledges that this is a private transaction between the pharmacist and the client and that it should not be determined by the Government. The coalition will be supporting the Government's amendment, which eliminates the price control implications of this section of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to pharmaceutical eligibility checking, the Government announced in November 1989 its black box proposal whereby each pharmacist's computer would be used to check pharmaceutical entitlement by way of a computerised link with the Health Insurance Commission. The then Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Blewett, rejected the proposal during the election campaign as a result of criticisms from the Privacy Commissioner and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal is an amended version of the black box proposal. The major differences are: first, the latest initiative entails a dedicated computer facility which will be kept separate from the pharmacist's computer-that is, if the pharmacist decides so; there is a possibility that the pharmacist may link it with the special facility. Secondly, guidelines will be issued by the Privacy Commissioner governing the conduct of pharmacists and the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of alleviating the privacy concerns, these are marked improvements to the original failed proposal. However, this is a highly intrusive and universal system. Potentially, every Australian will be subjected to an identity check every time he or she makes a claim on a pharmaceutical benefits program. In the case of social security and veterans affairs recipients, this will entail the pharmacist receiving a confirmation of their concessionary entitlement from the Health Insurance Commission. The Commission will receive up-to-date benefit information from these departments which it will use during the confirmation process. In the case of all other Australians, their identity will be checked with information held by the Health Insurance Commission. Although the Government claims that the system is voluntary, pharmacists run the risk of not having a claim honoured by the Commission unless the client's identity has been confirmed by the Commission when the script is dispensed by the pharmacist. </PARA>
<PARA> With such an intrusive system being applied to all Australians, it is imperative to have guidelines which protect the rights of individual users. The Government has recognised this, and pharmaceutical benefits guidelines have been drafted by the Privacy Commissioner. However, the Government has not gone far enough. Every Australian will be affected by this proposal. All Australians will run the risk of having their PBS entitlement rejected if they cannot provide adequate information. All pharmacists risk having claims for payment rejected if they do not obtain confirmation of identity. Pensioners, the unemployed, invalids, the poor and the sick risk having to pay the full price of pharmaceuticals if they cannot provide adequate identification to their pharmacist. </PARA>
<PARA> When a system places responsibilities of this nature on individuals and pharmacists, the users must have every confidence that they can seek redress if they feel that they have been unfairly treated by the system. It is not sufficient to simply hope and trust that no-one will be unfairly disadvantaged by the system. The guidelines must have legal status. They must also be subject to proper scrutiny by the Parliament which represents the 16 million-odd Australians who will be affected by the Government's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that it will not implement the eligibility checking proposals until the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines have been finalised, and nor should it. However, the coalition will be moving an amendment to ensure that this does not happen. Rather than a Minister asking the Privacy Commissioner to devise guidelines, we will make it a legal requirement to have such guidelines. We will seek to make these guidelines disallowable instruments, thus ensuring that they are subjected to the proper scrutiny that such a far-reaching proposal deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also ensure that any breach of the guidelines is considered to be a breach of the Privacy Act. This means that the Privacy Commissioner will have the power to investigate any complaints he receives about an action that is in breach of the guidelines. Without all these amendments, the guidelines would be largely ineffective in upholding the rights of individual Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's other major concern about the pharmaceutical eligibility checking proposal relates to the Government's failure to provide an accurate breakdown of the savings that will be derived from this initiative. In the minority report, coalition senators concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>In light of the evidence presented to the Committee, it is impossible to assess the cost and/or the benefits of the Government's pharmaceutical eligibility checking initiative.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition members of the Committee are confident that the net financial initiative from the Bill will be considerably smaller than that estimated by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has cited two surveys, one by the Auditor-General and one by the Health Insurance Commission, as evidence of the need to introduce computerised eligibility checking. One of these surveys claimed that the non-entitlement rate was 5.22 per cent, whilst the other claimed that it was between 2.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent. Those who have expressed doubts about the accuracy of these surveys include the Health Insurance Commission, the Auditor-General, the Pharmacy Guild as well as the coalition parties. The Government has simply taken 4.5 per cent as a happy medium between these two surveys and calculated that this non-entitlement rate will result in $40m in gross savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The doubt about the accuracy of the costings and the amount of untested assumptions contained within them may be best summed up by the Minister's representative in the Senate when addressing the Committee this week. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>As to the exact order of these, you would need to have a look at them in a more sophisticated way than simply saying `$40m'. I think that is what this Committee has done. Nevertheless, there are savings available and, for that reason, the Government believes the system is justified.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately for us, but maybe fortunately for the Government, it will probably be impossible to check the accuracy of the Government's savings estimates. But that is to be examined because these savings will be subsumed in general savings in the cost of administering the pharmaceutical benefits program as a result of the range of changes announced in the last Budget, including the $2.50 price indicator. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently, 80 per cent of pharmacists make their claims upon the Health Insurance Commission by way of a computerised link which is known as the claims transmission system (CTS). This Bill seeks to make it compulsory for all pharmacists to submit their payment claims through the CTS. However, the Secretary will be given the power to exempt pharmacists such as those serving isolated areas from submitting their claims through the CTS. In the explanatory memorandum it is stated that the move to compulsory CTS will result in savings of $6m. </PARA>
<PARA> During prior questioning in the Senate Estimates committee hearings, the Health Insurance Commission claimed that $6m would be saved by all pharmacists making their claims through the CTS. As 80 per cent have complied voluntarily, it is misleading for the Government to claim that $6m will be saved from introducing a compulsory CTS. It is far closer to the truth that the 20 per cent remaining non-complying pharmacists will realise savings in the order of $1.2m for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has no qualms with the computerised system per se. However, we are concerned that the rules governing the conduct of the CTS are properly scrutinised, and that there are appropriate avenues of review and appeals for pharmacists. Until the introduction of this Bill, rules governing the CTS were laid down by a delegated representative of the Minister in a determination under section 98C (1) (b) of the National Health Act. Unfettered powers contained in this determination include being able to disqualify a person from using the CTS indefinitely without reason and without any avenue of appeal. Independent in-house legal opinion expressed grave concern about these unfettered powers and, in addition, external legal opinion also expressed doubt about these powers being included in a determination that did not require tabling or disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> I have expressed these concerns a number of times in the Senate. I am pleased to say that the Government has taken heed of these expressions of concern and has introduced new sections 99AAA to 99AAC into the National Health Act. Under these new sections, the Minister will make the rules governing the conduct of the CTS. These rules will be disallowable instruments, and there will be avenues of appeal for pharmacists. However, the unfettered powers contained in section 98C (1) (b) remain. Even though the Government has given a commitment to use section 99 to make rules governing the CTS, there is nothing to stop the Minister or a delegate of the Minister from still relying on section 98C (1) (b). </PARA>
<PARA> The offending section cannot be removed from the Act as it is also used for other quite legitimate purposes. However, to prevent any future unscrutinised use of section 98C (1) (b), the coalition will move an amendment which will make determinations made under this section disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have stated throughout this speech-and as was expressed in the minority report of the Finance and Public Administration Committee-the coalition is concerned about the lack of adequate information that has been provided to allow a properly informed debate about these proposals. We will support the Bill because we believe it goes some way towards preventing people who are not eligible under the pharmaceutical benefits program from rorting the system. However, we are not at all convinced that no other methods could have been used to achieve similar, if not better, results. On behalf of the coalition, I move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate expresses its concern that the Government has failed to provide adequate figures to allow an informed assessment of the costs incurred and the benefits derived from:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the restriction of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Program entitlement to Australian residents;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the introduction of an on-line pharmaceutical eligibility checking proposal; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the implementation of a compulsory Claims Transmission System''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 1991 and the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991. I begin by looking at the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. This Bill has a number of purposes and amends a number of Acts. It is supported by the Australian Democrats. Therefore, I will not go through it in great detail. However, I want to look at the main changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments to Medicare clarify a requirement that medical practitioners cannot claim under Medicare where they merely physically attend a patient but provide no clinically relevant service, such as a medical examination or a diagnostic test. There will also be a requirement for the proprietor of a pathology laboratory to take all reasonable steps to inform the providing practitioner and the patient that Medicare will not be payable where the approval of the laboratory has been revoked by the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Commission. Failure to make such a disclosure will be an offence. We support these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes a number of amendments to legislation covering nursing homes. The main amendments include the overriding of secrecy provisions in the National Health Act to enable the Minister to release information to the public about nursing homes. This information will include nursing homes' action plans which apply to homes which do not meet prescribed standards of care; basic facts such as the number of beds, the fees charged and general descriptive information about the nursing homes; and information about any action that is to be taken to suspend or revoke a nursing home's approval or to vary the conditions of the home's approval. Proprietors will have 30 days in which to request a review of the decision to release information unless, of course, release is urgently required to protect the welfare of residents. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some concern has been expressed about the breadth of these provisions, but it is desirable that potential residents and their families are well aware of the home which they may look at moving into and that, therefore, they have access to this type of information. Despite the efforts of the Government and of the vast majority of nursing homes, unfortunately we cannot hide the fact that there are still a few homes where serious problems arise. The public has the right to be aware of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for an additional sanction to be used when a nursing home has breached one or more conditions of its approval. Currently, the only available sanctions are suspension or revoking of approval. The amendments will enable the Commonwealth to stop paying benefits for new admissions to the nursing home after the making of the determination that conditions have been breached. These measures are part of a number of steps to improve the quality of nursing home care and to ensure that the rights of residents are paramount.</PARA>
<PARA> This is one area where the Government, particularly Minister Staples, deserves credit for instituting welcome and long overdue changes that will ultimately enhance the quality of life of the residents of nursing homes. The Democrats have supported the Government's actions and its approach. We will not be moving any amendments to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also involves some changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act and makes some progress towards greater flexibility in the administration of this Act. I speak particularly about the individual patient usage or IPU scheme. Until now, IPU approvals have been given centrally. Typically, where a doctor feels that his or her patient requires a particular drug that is not available in Australia, the doctor has to approach a medical officer in the therapeutic goods administration who then assesses each individual request. However, requests for approvals have increased dramatically: 17,979 in 1989-90 and 9,409 in the six months ending 31 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This centralised system is quite unwieldy and has resulted in even greater delays. This Bill will authorise regulations which will permit IPU approvals to be given to doctors outside the public service and to medical officers in specified hospitals. We welcome this move and the improved flexibility in the IPU system; it certainly is long overdue. However, there are still some enormous problems with the IPU scheme. For example, the IPU scheme requires the failure of accepted, conventional treatment before approval is granted for access to an unapproved drug. Even then, use is subject to the willingness of the company involved in Australia to supply the drug and mutually acceptable arrangements being put in place regarding protocols, reporting requirements, costs and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, Bill Whittaker, recently commented that the IPU and personal invitation schemes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . cannot deliver drugs already approved overseas quickly and equitably to people with life threatening illnesses. Increasingly they are imposing heavy costs on consumers, both financially and in terms of effort. They place the onus on consumers to seek out their own treatments when it is the system that should be providing vital drugs to those in need.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the push for change in this area has gained substantial momentum since the advent of AIDS, but it is clear that the present system fails to properly address the needs and rights of people suffering from other life threatening illnesses such as cancer. It is also clear that there are significant problems in Australia's system of marketing approval for pharmaceuticals and I look forward to the report of Professor Peter Baume's review of our drug regulation system. I am hopeful that this will be the signal for some decisive action from the Government resulting in something more substantial than mere tinkering with the system, which is what we argue this Bill does. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill is the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill also makes several amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act. The amendments deal with the grouping of therapeutic goods which have common characteristics and a common manufacturer. Basically, the amendments mean that such goods will be charged for registration or listing as a group rather than incurring a separate charge for each individual item. We support this Bill and we will not be moving any amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in looking at the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991, this Bill amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953 to implement reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) which were announced in the 1990 Budget. The changes to the administration of the scheme involve the introduction of a checking system whereby pharmacists will be connected on-line to the Health Insurance Commission's computer to enable verification of a patient's entitlement. As Senator Patterson pointed out, that is for concessional benefits or the general benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that an earlier version of such a scheme, the so-called `black box' proposal, was dropped by the Government because of pharmacists' opposition and very real concerns expressed by the Privacy Commissioner. I acknowledge that the proposal that is now before us is very different from the earlier proposal where a fully interactive system involved two-way transmission of data and uncertainties about whether data from the Medicare and PBS programs would be kept separate. There was also a lack of precision about the information to be provided to pharmacists. The Democrats do not oppose justifiable measures aimed at reducing fraud on the public purse under the PBS or, indeed, any other government scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, however, we do have a number of problems with this Bill. Our starting point, our first concern, in assessing measures of this kind is the need to strike a balance between the protection of individual privacy and the protection of the public purse from fraud and rorting. In this situation, the debate is always about these competing principles, as the Privacy Commissioner has observed on a number of occasions. The judgment which must be made, then, is the extent to which intrusions into privacy are justified on the basis of the competing principle of protection of the public purse. On that basis, I will now canvass and weigh up the competing claims made in relation to the proposal before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government itself claims that eligibility testing is estimated to save in the vicinity of $12m in 1991-92, $34m in 1992-93 and $40m in each year thereafter. The announced expenditure will amount to some $12.7m, $14.8m, $13.7m and $14.2m respectively in those years. The Government claims that the extension of the claims transaction system to all pharmacists will save it a further $6m in a full year and the restriction of entitlements to the pharmaceutical benefits program to Australian residents only will save another $6m annually. But it is most interesting to read how it actually arrived at the $6m. I commend to honourable senators the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The savings of $40m are gross savings. When we break them down and try to work out exactly how the Government arrived at this figure, we need to go back and look at exactly what the Government is talking about in terms of fraud. One would imagine that that would be deliberate fraud. But that is not the case. When we look more carefully we find that at least half of the 3 1/2 per cent fraud that the Government has been claiming is made up in fact of mistakes-in other words, forms that have been wrongly numbered, forms that contain incorrect dates, et cetera. Although an old card may have been used, the person concerned still had an entitlement. That brings us down to 1.7 per cent fraud, assuming that the full rate applies. This means that the savings will be considerably less than $40m-in fact a maximum of $20m. If we then take off the $14m a year that the system is actually going to cost, we are left with a saving of some $6m at most. We question whether that $6m is in fact accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at the report on this Bill of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that Senator Patterson mentioned previously. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's review of the cost-benefit analysis was complicated by the Government's failure to provide any detailed costings for this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Patterson has a second reading attachment that I will have a close look at because I understand that it tackles this problem. At paragraph 3 the Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> A further major ground for concern about the cost-benefit analysis is the significant variations in the estimates of the percentage of PBS claims which are invalid.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have already highlighted, there is a major problem in terms of exactly what we are talking about when we are dealing with fraud and whether a particular prescription is valid. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph 4 talks about the fact that we are going to have great difficulty in assessing the eventual benefits of this whole proposal. Paragraph 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee learned that the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) will not be able to ascertain how much of the total savings in the cost of administering the PBS has been derived from each of its cost cutting mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the HIC needs to be able to identify: how much has been saved by restricting PBS entitlement to Australian residents; how much through checking PBS eligibility by way of a dedicated computer facility; and how much as a result of introducing the $2.50 price indicator . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Which was done some months ago. So this leaves a very big question. As this question remains unanswered, the Democrats in turn will not be supporting this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to deal with my second concern. I want to look at the failure of the Government to consider the alternatives that would be much cheaper, much easier on the system, particularly on the pharmacists and, we argue, of much greater benefit to the consumers who should be our major concern. Paragraph 1 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Government had not considered alternate methods of preventing unauthorised claims on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Possible alternatives would be:</PARA>
<PARA> a) improving the Health Insurance Commission's (HIC) internal auditing procedures;</PARA>
<PARA> b) improving the integrity of social security fringe benefits cards (as suggested by the Privacy Commissioner) and demanding the immediate return of all expired cards;</PARA>
<PARA> c) checking eligibility at the time that the prescription is written by the medical practitioner;</PARA>
<PARA> d) ensuring that the pharmacists check the expiry date of concession cards; or</PARA>
<PARA> e) taking legal action against people who seek pharmaceutical benefits to which they are not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA>I would stress here, too, that nobody is claiming, Government or otherwise, the existence of massive fraud but rather the existence of a range of possible mistakes in relation to concessional entitlements. It is rather ironical then that one clear example of fraud, where one person can use the card of another person, is not going to be resolved by this scheme at all. In this connection, one can refer to the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time left I want to mention briefly our concerns relating to privacy. It is true that the Privacy Commissioner has worked on guidelines and I certainly welcome that. He has professed himself satisfied with the situation as it now stands. Unfortunately, the Australian Privacy Foundation remains profoundly concerned and I draw the Senate's attention to evidence given earlier this week by its representatives to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I want to quote from the Hansard record what was said by a witness who had a number of concerns. Mr Davies said:</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, we are concerned that this system brings into too close a proximity medical records-medical consultation histories-and pharmacy use histories. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that this system does create for the first time a link between the three major numbering systems-the TFN, the DSS number and the Medicare number.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The third point is that there is no privacy protection whatever in the Bill. I understand that in other Bills there may be limited provision, but we contend that this Bill must have very strict guidelines on privacy and procedures. Ministerial instrument simply is not satisfactory . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome some amendments that I understand will be moved tonight. Mr Davies continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point is that there is a real-time locater function in this system.</PARA>
<PARA>He made a couple of other comments that I would like to read. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think you all understand the term function creep which basically means that when a system is established by mysterious means and devious means the process is enlarged . . . The tax file number is a perfect example of function creep . . . We believe that just as the Medicare card is now used for two purposes, it may be used for more. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The final point is the card itself. Although the Privacy Foundation has no problems with the card, or even the magnetic strip, we do have problems with a card and a strip that are not adequately oversighted in legislation, are not adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only does the Privacy Foundation have some problems but the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills also expressed concern. Those concerns cannot be lightly dismissed, particularly when the announced justification for intruding on privacy is itself open to question. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the people who will be responsible for administering this scheme if it comes into operation-the pharmacists. They share many of the concerns that I have already outlined but there is an additional very important reason for their opposition. On page 4 of their submission they state:</PARA>
<PARA>In general the overall cost effectiveness of the proposal should be such that the benefits must outweigh any disadvantages not simply in dollar terms. There must be:</PARA>
<PARA> tangible benefits to patients;</PARA>
<PARA> tangible benefits to pharmacists;</PARA>
<PARA> reduction in fraud (note that the system will not prevent persons fraudulently using other persons Medicare cards);</PARA>
<PARA> no significant increase in clerical work for the pharmacist. </PARA>
<PARA>One should look at the very considerable extra burden that is going to be placed on pharmacists. If pharmacists do make a claim for additional payments for scripts, we will find that just a 5c increase in scripts will mean a $5m cost to the public purse and there goes any savings, if there were any, that this Bill may have meant. </PARA>
<PARA> As they note themselves, the primary role of pharmacists is to dispense prescriptions. The safety and well-being of their patients must not be put at risk by the imposition of administrative burdens of this type. They are already attempting to come to terms with considerable changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Many elderly people still do not understand that they must always pay their $2.50. This can take considerable time-I have personal experience of that-with queues in pharmacies growing. Also, under the new system, they must be issued with generic drugs if they are cheaper than the ones that have been prescribed. Again, this imposes extra burdens on the pharmacists and takes up more of the time of the customers getting their prescriptions filled. Even if one accepts-and I do not-that the Government is entitled to transfer costs from the Health Insurance Commission to the private sector, to the pharmacists, the potential for interfering with the pharmacists' dispensing function in doing so is quite unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to my original question: has an appropriate balance been struck between the protection of privacy and the protection of the public purse? The answer is: definitely not. I note that the Liberals are to move a number of amendments. I have not seen the final draft; but if they do answer any of the concerns that have been raised by the various people I have mentioned, the Democrats will certainly be supporting them. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go through the reasons that the Democrats will not be supporting this Bill. The claimed figures in justification for the scheme are rubbery, to say the least; alternative, less intrusive methods of addressing the problems that exist-I acknowledge that problems do exist-are available. Privacy protection remains an outstanding concern and patient well-being and safety are put at potential risk. We welcome attempts to improve this legislation. As I said, the Opposition is to move a number of amendments. We will not be moving amendments because, even with them, we believe this Bill will not be worth supporting. We will be voting against it at the second reading stage. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating three Bills: the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 1991, and the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991. The first Bill has been dealt with thoroughly by my colleague Senator Patterson. While she also dealt thoroughly with the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill, I would like to address that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that only those people entitled to receive benefits under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme can claim this entitlement. The explanatory memorandum that the Government has put out reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill makes it clear that the benefits of the Scheme are only to be available to Australian residents and those few other persons who under the Health Insurance Act 1973 are declared to be eligible persons. This amendment will preclude the benefits being obtained by visitors to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill further tightens the eligibility testing on those persons who claim concessional benefits under the Scheme but in fact are not entitled to those benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government claims that there have been rorts and that it has been losing a lot of money by people making various claims. We know that presently-the Government acknowledges this-there are about 300,000 extra Medicare cards floating around. The Government, very understandably, wants this cleared up, but it has chosen the most elaborate and high-cost method one could possibly imagine. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation not only has great privacy concerns, as Senator Patterson said, but also it imposes many additional costs on pharmacists. I believe that pharmacists should be subsidised for the cost of their time, staff and inconvenience. The pharmacist has to deal with patients coming in with a prescription and having to be identified as being entitled to supplementary benefits when they are not on the register. He is then left to deal with these angry, confused people. Because of our concerns we will be moving quite substantial amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 was sent to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and clause 7 was sent to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for examination. Those two committees duly met. I intend to quote from the minority report put out by Opposition members of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. That report, I believe, was not only able to set a standard for all other Senate committees to follow but also is of such high quality that I will be referring to it quite considerably during my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 deals with the interpretation of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. The Committee called before it Senator Michael Tate, representing the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), and Mr Kevin Hazell, the Assistant General Manager of the Health Benefits Division of the Health Insurance Commission, assisted the Minister. Members of the Opposition who put in the minority report were led by Senator John Watson, the Deputy Chairman, Senator Rod Kemp and Senator Ian Campbell. The report is something we should all read, mark, learn and inwardly digest. Government members made no comment, even after all the criticisms levelled at the legislation during the inquiry. However, Opposition members did comment and I intend to quote from their report later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole purpose of this Bill is to save the Government costs. The financial impact statement that the Government has included in the explanatory memorandum reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility testing is estimated to save $12 million in 1991/92, $23 million in the 1992/93 and $40 million each year thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>If we are looking at those figures as a saving they are not quite accurate because I understand that they reflect the gross saving. The cost of implementing the savings comes to $14.2m, so the savings are really only $25.8m-if that original gross figure is accurate. It is not clear and it is not correct to say that the savings are $40m each year because the costs must, of course, be taken from it. We must look at the situation in two ways: first, at the accuracy of the figures that the Government has given us on its estimates and, secondly, at how it should be corrected. The Government, in the explanatory memorandum, stated how it came to its financial impact statement:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that the restriction of payment of Pharmaceutical Benefits to Australian residents-</PARA>
<PARA>and that small handful of other eligible people in that line-</PARA>
<PARA>will save $6 million of Commonwealth outlays in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>That was limiting the entitlement to Australian citizens only. The Committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The estimate is based on an untested and highly questionable assumption that there are about 200,000 non-residents who are half as likely as Australian residents to utilise the PBS. The need to check every Australian resident's entitlement to prevent non-residents from rorting the system is arguable on the basis of this flimsy evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>How can the Government make the odd guess that 200,000 non-residents are half as likely as Australian residents to utilise the pharmaceutical benefits scheme? It seems to me that that first estimate is right off the top of the head and has no credibility at all. The Committee goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has not incorporated this saving into its costings, presumably because it believes it is negligible. Even if one in six non-residents seeking pharmaceuticals makes a fraudulent claim on the PBS, the total saving would be $1 million. Considering many visitors bring their pharmaceuticals with them and/or take out health insurance in their home country, a figure of this magnitude is unlikely. It is arguable whether it necessitates upwards of 10 million non-concessionary Australian residents having their Medicare Cards swiped by pharmacists every time they make a PBS claim.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, very rightly, the Committee is saying that the Government is making 10 million Australians go to their pharmacists with their Medicare card and have the card swiped by the pharmacist just because it believes, off the top of its head, that 200,000 non-residents who are half as likely as Australian residents to utilise the claim might be rorting the system. The mind boggles. What a debacle. Of course, the Government does not mention the fact that there is nothing to stop me lending a visitor my Medicare card. That visitor could then go to a pharmacy and have it swiped. There is nothing at all to prove that the visitor who is using my card is not me. So for the Government to make the grand estimate of a saving of $6m seems to me to be quite incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was unable to provide any detailed costings, so these were not dissected into the various groupings. The Committee states that these:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . have not been dissected into those derived from people whose expired concession cards have not been checked by pharmacists and those derived from people who have become ineligible for benefits before their concession cards have expired. This is a crucial distinction in assessing the likely benefits of the proposed scheme, as opposed to benefits that could be obtained by other, less costly and less intrusive means. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to refer to conflicting assessments made of the percentage of invalid PBS claims. The Auditor-General says it is 5.22 per cent while the Health Insurance Commission says it is about 3.5 per cent. As each percentage point amounts to a saving of nearly $10m, it is crucial that we have accurate figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee was told that the Health Insurance Commission's survey was more comprehensive, I would like to quote from a letter by Mr Turk, the manager of the pharmaceutical benefits branch of the Health Insurance Commission, to the Department of Community Services and Health, as it then was. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The exercise was carried out in all State offices and proved to be both time and resource consuming. One of the major problems encountered was the lack of currency of data maintained on the DSS data base which was used for verification purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures are a lot less than the 40% level of inaccuracy for pensioner and concessional entitlement numbers quoted in the Auditor-General's report referred in the `Strategy Proposal' document. Internal analysis and review of entitlement numbers also quoted in the `Strategy Proposal' document put the invalid entitlement figure at approximately 3-4%. These figures should be compared with the results of the latest review which estimates a cost of invalid entitlements at $20 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty in obtaining these figures and the significant variations shown on a State by State basis still casts some doubt upon their accuracy. </PARA>
<PARA>We had the Auditor-General saying 5.22 per cent and the Health Insurance Commission saying 3.5 per cent. What figure did the Government use? It accepted 4.5 per cent, which is somewhere between 5.22 per cent and 3.5 per cent. But, when one percentage point equals nearly $10m, one can understand the concerns of both the Committee members and the Opposition. We know that 90 per cent of Department of Social Security Department of Veterans' Affairs beneficiaries have a permanent eligibility and that about 10 per cent move in and out of eligibility at quite a rate. I again quote from the Committee's report:</PARA>
<PARA> In October 1990 the HIC introduced a check digit routine into all pharmacy computers. This routine seeks to ensure that entitlement numbers recorded in pharmacies, and thus sent to the HIC by CTS-</PARA>
<PARA>the claims transmission system-</PARA>
<PARA>have a higher degree of accuracy. This action will have already reduced the number of inaccurate entitlement numbers forwarded to the HIC since the Auditor-General's original report. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The system is therefore being introduced to identify only that small number of people who are using benefit numbers for which they are no longer entitled as well as all non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is proposing to introduce a scheme that will use a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. We have this very costly scheme and we believe that the savings will be nowhere near the assessment that the Government has made, of $25.8m. The comment that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) made, having listened to the various Departments trying to explain how they came to their figures, was a very telling one. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>As to the exact order of these, you would have to look at them in a more sophisticated way than simply saying $40m. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that that is what the Committee has done. Nevertheless, savings are available and for that reason the Government believes that the system is justified. Yet Senator Tate has acknowledged that the way the estimates had been done by the Government really could not be verified. The Opposition members of the Committee pointed out very clearly that the estimates that the Government had come to were far from accurate and were cause for concern. The Opposition is also greatly concerned about this. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside the financial aspects of the legislation, I turn now to the question of alternative methods. I believe that some of the alternative methods suggested by the Opposition members of the Committee would have to be looked at by the Government before anyone could possibly say that this legislation was the best method of attempting to save these costs. I again quote from this very excellent report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>It was clear that the Government had not considered alternative methods of preventing un authorised claims on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Possible alternatives would be:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) improving the Health Insurance Commission's (HIC) internal auditing procedures;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) improving the integrity of social security fringe benefits cards (as suggested by the Privacy Commissioner) and demanding the immediate return of all expired cards;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) checking eligibility at the time that the prescription is written by the medical practitioner;</PARA>
<PARA>(d) ensuring that pharmacists check the expiry date of concession cards; or</PARA>
<PARA>(e) taking legal action against people who seek pharmaceutical benefits to which they are not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA>None of those alternatives has been gone into by the Government. The committee members believed that this would be a far cheaper method for cost savings by the Government and for the pharmacists who have to implement this very complicated and costly procedure. If the Opposition were able to come up with so many simple and cost effective alternatives, why has the Government not looked at some alternative method? Why has it not at least looked at demanding that, when a new card is commenced, pharmacists simply check the expiry date of the card? If they were able to take legal action against people who seek pharmaceutical benefits to which they are not entitled, that may well scare people into not abusing the system. Perhaps they could demand the immediate return of all expired cards, just for starters. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government implemented just those simple measures for perhaps 12 months, to see whether they worked and to see what savings came from implementing them, at least that would be a start and additional costs to the taxpayer and the stresses and pressures of costs to the individual pharmacist would be avoided. The Government has set about trying to stop an abuse. We do not know the extent of it. We have no idea what the cost savings will be. We have no idea whether it will amount to the $25.8m or whether it will be $2m. The Government must give us more accurate figures before we reach the committee stage of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before addressing my remarks to the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991, I must declare an interest through a very influential and persuasive wife who is a qualified salaried pharmacist. It is not that any of the savings in costs will accrue to our family, but my wife, Jocelyn, is very conscious of the need to save the maximum amount of money, possibly through the elimination of payment for ineligible scrips. On the other hand, she wants to ensure that there is a very efficient, cost effective and less intrusive system for both pharmacists and clients. I thank her for her contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a time when there is an urgent need for micro-economic reform, this Government is imposing a costly system on pharmacies, and indeed on all Australians who use pharmaceutical scrip products. This Bill has all the ingredients of a socialistic, inefficient Health Insurance Commission (HIC). It is clear that the Government has not adequately considered the alternative methods of preventing un- authorised claims on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). </PARA>
<PARA> We are very conscious of the inadequate internal auditing procedures. We believe alternative methods could include the possibility of improving the integrity of the social security fringe benefits card, as suggested by the Privacy Commissioner, the immediate return of all cards, the ascertaining of eligibility at the time when the prescription is written by the medical practitioner, ensuring that the pharmacist checks the expiry date and the return of the cards on the expiry date or, better still, of the expiry date of a card being automatically fed into the chemist's computer. Also, legal action could be taken against those people who receive pharmaceutical benefits to which they are not entitled. There are quite a number of other possibilities, with which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, as a doctor, would be quite familiar. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate was honest enough to admit, in relation to the $40m in gross savings on invalid prescriptions and the $6m alleged savings on overseas visitors, that the exact amounts were not known. We therefore have an admission from the Federal Government that it is not really sure how much taxpayers' money could be saved by forcing pharmacists to use this on-line computer system. Senator Tate, in his usual frank way, said that the Government would have to look at the costings in a more sophisticated way than it had done previously. Now that the Minister has had the opportunity to look at the Opposition's amendments, I trust that he will agree with the approach that we have taken of calling on the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance for a joint report for alternative systems. Mr Hazell, on the other hand, from the Health Insurance Commission (HIC), said:</PARA>
<PARA>The $6m saving by paying for medicines for overseas visitors and illegal migrants was based on the untested assumption that the group would only use about half the medicines of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The methods are quite unsatisfactory and arbitrary and they just cannot stand up. I must, of course, draw attention to comments made by the Director of the Privacy Commission, Simon Davies, who is concerned about the guesswork in relation to the savings aspect. He also drew attention to the secret agenda-not that I want to be linked with that-of introducing a checking mechanism that could possibly link the HIC data with Department of Social Security data and then the tax file number. Even Privacy Commissioner, Kevin O'Connor, indicated that there was no exact bridge by which health insurance, social security and tax file data could be linked. Nevertheless, he did warn that perhaps there could be lingering doubts in the minds of many people that a de facto identity card would not go away. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, Mr Hazel admitted that the practice of borrowing cards would not necessarily reduce illegal payments where patients adopted this new technique and could continue to obtain scripts at lower costs. The Government seems to be obsessed with the view that by reducing the number of pharmacies and putting added burdens, costs and difficulties on to pharmacists, a lot of money can be saved. But in circumstances where a doctor writes 400 scripts a week, does it really matter a great deal cost-wise whether the patients with those 400 scripts go to one pharmacy or go to three pharmacies? The Government should concentrate on those measures to discourage doctors from writing so many scripts. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take this argument a further step back, preventative health care is much cheaper than hospitalisation. I think we have lost the focus of our vision by concentrating on the pharmacists' end of the spectrum. I am reminded of the old simple adage that a stitch in time saves nine; I think that is appropriate in any discussions on health care costs. Unfortunately, we tend to focus on the pharmacy end of the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disgusted by the response to one of the questions as to why it was the pharmacist rather than others, including the doctors, who had to act as the policeman. It was stated that perhaps doctors had the means to fight such a proposal more strongly than the pharmacists. In other words, there was an admission that doctors had more clout, whether for constitutional or other reasons. I do not wish to suggest that, but maybe I led people into making that statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The computerised claim system will mean that not only will the Health Insurance Commission hold all Medicare claim records on file but also all patient drug history. If linked together, this could form some sort of data base containing a person's intimate medical and pharmaceutical history. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that there have been 16 major impacts in recent years on the pharmaceutical profession. I am deliberately truncating my contribution tonight, but I think this is important. Those 16 include the decision in November 1989 to reduce pharmacists' remuneration for dispensing pharmaceutical benefit prescription, and to abolish the mark-up component that took effect; reducing the pharmacists' remuneration by $1.05 per scrip on 20 December 1989; in August 1990, the introduction of a charge for pensioners-additional work for pharmacies; and, in January 1991, the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an unacceptable attack by this Government on a very recognised and reputable profession. I hope that the Government will respond in a very positive way to the amendments that have been proposed by the coalition by ensuring that there is a further proper evaluation to ensure that this system does not go ahead without a more satisfactory system of costing and a less intrusive approach. I thank the Minister for his nod of approval. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators who have contributed to the discussion on these very important allied Bills that are being debated in the Senate chamber on the last sitting night for this autumn session. The first is the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. As honourable senators will be aware, it covers many matters. As the legislation currently stands-and you will be very well aware of this, Madam Acting Deputy President-a medical practitioner could itemise an account and claim Medicare benefits for a service where a physical attendance on the patient occurs, but during which no clinically relevant service takes place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed amendment requires that a professional service be related to a medical examination, treatment, diagnosis or test that is necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient. I would have thought that that would be a very elementary but very necessary clarification of what is required in the undertaking of a professional service to a patient. Clearly, it must be related to a clinically relevant service. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clause in this Bill to require the proprietor of a pathology laboratory, the approval for which has been revoked, to take all reasonable steps to inform the providing practitioner and the patient that a Medicare benefit would not be payable in respect of the pathology service and to require the Minister to advertise such a decision. We have found some cases recently where pathology laboratories have failed to reach an acceptable standard of operation, the approval has been revoked and the Department of Community Services and Health has become aware that the operators of some of these revoked premises have continued to perform pathology services without informing either the referring practitioners or the patients. I think that that is an obvious matter that needed to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a measure to facilitate the release of information about nursing homes to the public. I understand that the Opposition has raised some questions about the release of information on nursing homes. I understand that the Opposition sought an assurance from the Minister for Community Services and Health that departmental officers and geriatric assessment teams would be instructed not to favour one home or another in giving out the information. In response, the departmental officers who become delegates of the Secretary for the purpose of this section of the Act will be instructed to ensure the accuracy of information to be released and not to favour one home or another in giving out requested information. </PARA>
<PARA> Geriatric assessment teams will not, as a general rule, receive delegation under this section. The type of information to be released is not information that assessment teams would collect as part of their functions under the National Health Act. In the rare cases that delegation for this purpose is given to assessment teams, they will receive the same instruction as departmental officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also sought assurances from the Minister that an appeals mechanism would be available prior to the publication of all information about nursing homes. In response, may I say that there are three categories of information to be released under this provision. First, information under section 45da of the National Health Act 1953 comprises action plans prepared by a nursing home proprietor on how standards in the home will be improved. Since these plans are drawn up by the proprietor, an appeal mechanism relating to the release of the plans is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, proposed clause 45db concerns basic descriptive information that will be provided to the public on request. Appeal prior to release is inappropriate here. The decision to release is subject to ministerial review and Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) appeal, but there is no required waiting period between the decision and release. </PARA>
<PARA> Information under proposed clause 45dc concerns actions the Minister has taken or intends to take to withdraw, suspend or vary the approval of a home. A decision to release this information is subject to ministerial review, AAT appeal and a statutory 30-day delay between decision and release when representations can be made to the Secretary. A 30-day delay does not apply when there is an urgent need to protect the welfare or interests of residents. I hope that that gives some of the assurances that I understand were sought by the Opposition in relation to the releasing of certain information concerning nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, this particular Bill is not the subject of any amendments to be moved in the chamber. I do not think that I need to canvass any of the other matters that were dealt with, and I think I have responded to the concerns that were expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the allied Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 1991 which we are also debating, that is a rather technical Bill to do with grouped goods. The policy intention is that grouped goods should continue to attract only a single annual charge, rather than an annual charge for each product included in a group of goods that is separately registered or listed. Amendments to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act were necessary to achieve that result and to match the changes made by the portfolio Bill. I understand that that is not the subject of any great contest in the chamber either. </PARA>
<PARA> The major legislation of interest to honourable senators has been the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991. I am grateful for the contribution of those honourable senators who have spoken, although it took Senator Watson-that indomitable Tasmanian-to raise the rhetorical stakes in this particular debate when he spoke of the inefficient, socialised Health Insurance Commission and its schemes in this instance. I think that that was going a little over the top. As I say, it is the final night of the autumn sitting and I think Senator Watson would agree that he was just displaying a little bit of rhetorical flourish. In fact, the Health Insurance Commission is recognised as being extremely efficient, and I think it beats any of the private health insurance bodies in Australia hands down as far as efficiency is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I do believe that making changes to the administration of the scheme to involve the introduction of a checking system whereby pharmacists will be connected on line to the Health Insurance Commission's computer-more correctly, the Commission's eligibility file-will allow immediate verification of the patient's entitlement to free pharmaceutical benefits, concessional benefits or general benefits, and is a very sensible change to the way in which this particular scheme of pharmaceutical benefits is to be administered.</PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that most honourable senators dealt with the matter in a calm and rational way, looking for the efficiency gains that might be obtained as opposed to the regime that is being sought to be imposed by this Bill. I appreciated that tone. It was certainly different from that put forward by some of the witnesses at the committee meeting on Friday in relation to this matter. I think that we have to go back a little in history. When the Government took the decision to transfer the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) to the Health Insurance Commission, it was against a background in which the Australian Audit Office had found that there was no effective checking of entitlements under the program and that the data provided was insufficient to properly manage the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme which has been devised and which I have just described is the only way in which we believe all the problems could be comprehensively dealt with. Therefore, it deals with serious problems which the Australian Audit Office and others have identified. Clearly, parts of the problems which have been overcome by this scheme could have been overcome by some other method. But as a comprehensive total response to all the problems, this is the only scheme which can deal with everything that was revealed to be leading to the ineffective checking of entitlements in this program. For example, the suggestion for improving the integrity of Department of Social Security (DSS) cards was looked at, but the problem is not one of the integrity of the card. It is that a person's entitlement may change due to changed financial circumstances prior to the expiry date of the card issued to the person. That will always be the case and can only be addressed by a process in which the pharmacist is able to check the person's entitlement at the time of dispensing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson suggested in the committee stage that it might be realistic to ask a medical practitioner to do the checking rather than the chemist. I think that we refuted that very well in Committee. Certainly such a person has no financial involvement in the supply of the medication. I am sure that was the reason why we thought it inappropriate to suggest that the medical practitioner undertake that task; it was nothing to do with political clout or the Australian Medical Association union or any other such expression as may have fallen from Senator Watson's lips in an intemperate moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of anticipated savings. I think that this is a valid question for the Senate to have raised. I acknowledge that, and I understand that Senator Patterson has moved a second reading amendment which expresses some concern in that regard. I understand that the Committee Secretariat was provided with a couple of pages in response to the request by the Committee for further information in relation to the savings that were estimated to arise from improved eligibility checking. It was based on certain assumptions coming from the studies which were undertaken to check the entitlement of pharmacists' claims against data supplied by the DSS. In August 1989 the Commission had undertaken such a study, and it found that where a valid number was quoted, approximately 3.5 per cent of the services were found to have no current pensioner or concessional entitlement. Where an invalid number was quoted, no check was made against DSS entitlement records, but it was assumed that, once corrected, the level of error could be expected to be similar to that where a valid number was checked. </PARA>
<PARA> In its audit of the PBS for 1989-90, the Australian Audit Office did a more extensive study based on a limited but representative sample of 1,550 scripts which were checked against DSS entitlements. That study showed that in 5.22 per cent of scrips the person's entitlement had lapsed. As those studies were different in their methodology, and as the Australian Audit Office study was wider in scope and conducted on a smaller sample of claims, a conservative estimate of 4.5 per cent of pensioner and concessional scrips was used in the calculation of expected savings of $40m for the first anticipated full year of interactive processing, which is 1993-94. As senators will have been advised on the sheets that were provided to the Committee Secretariat, the savings were calculated on the basis of 4.5 per cent of an expected 72 million scripts at an expected saving of some $12.50 per scrip. That has been explained. </PARA>
<PARA> I have admitted that there are methods of post-payment checking which could cover some of the ineligibilities which no doubt could be picked up in that way. Admittedly, that would be a sum of some millions. In trying to estimate this comprehensive scheme in regard to the figure of $40m, this regime which is meant to cover all instances of cases where otherwise payment could be made to a person ineligible to receive it has been arrived at in a fair way, even though it will be the case that it is only when the scheme is in operation that we will be able to see whether the exact figures are borne out in the reality of experience. I think that it is a fair way to try to estimate savings arising from the improved eligibility checking. It is for that reason that the Government wishes that the scheme should proceed and that it should have the support of the Senate. It is also the reason why the Government cannot accept the second reading amendment moved by Senator Patterson. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the major matter of interest during the discussions in the Senate Committee, certainly in consideration of the Bill by the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that is the question of the operation of the privacy guidelines, the Government has indicated to Senator Patterson that we will be accepting all the amendments that she moved in this regard to ensure that the privacy guidelines are in operation in a way which satisfies the Parliament before the relevant sections of the Bill come into effect. We can deal with that more specifically in the committee stage. But I want to indicate at this second reading stage to Senator Lees that most of the amendments moved by Senator Patterson to deal with matters raised during the meeting of the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will be accepted by the Government. I commend the three Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> ``; (i) by inserting after subsection (3) the following subsections:</PARA>
<PARA> `(3A) If:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Commonwealth is liable under section 87a to pay an amount to an eligible person in relation to the supply by an approved supplier of a pharmaceutical benefit to the eligible person; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the amount (in this subsection called the ``purchase price'') paid by the eligible person to the approved supplier in respect of the supply of the pharmaceutical benefit is higher than the Commonwealth price of the pharmaceutical benefit;</PARA>
<PARA> the Secretary may, by notice in writing to the approved supplier require the supplier to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the difference between the purchase price, and the Commonwealth price, of the pharmaceutical benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> `(3B) The Commonwealth may, by action in a court of competent jurisdiction, recover any amount specified in a notice given to an approved supplier under subsection (3A) as a debt due to the Commonwealth by the supplier.' ''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment will amend the existing clause 15. Under the provisions of clause 12, a person who has not been able to prove eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits at the time of supply but who subsequently demonstrates that eligibility to the Secretary is entitled to receive from the Commonwealth a refund of the difference between the amount which the person paid and the amount which would have been payable if eligibility had been established at the time of supply. As a result of the amendment of clause 10 (2), the charge made by the approved supplier in these circumstances might be at the private price, which is usually higher than the Commonwealth price, and thus the refund under clause 12 would be correspondingly greater. </PARA>
<PARA> New paragraph 15 (i) adds provisions to section 99aa of the principal Act so that, where such a refund is made by the Commonwealth to a person who subsequently proves eligibility, the Commonwealth will be entitled to recover from the approved supplier the amount, if any, by which the price charged exceeds the Commonwealth price. Normally this will be done by means of the existing subsection 99aa (4) of the principal Act, which allows such an amount to be deducted from any other amount which is payable to the approved supplier. This amendment ensures that in such cases the approved supplier ultimately receives only the Commonwealth price, which is the amount which the supplier would have received had eligibility been proved at the time of supply. </PARA>

<PARA> `(g) a determination under paragraph 98c (1) (b).'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>In the second reading debate I spoke at length about the reason for the inclusion of amendment No. 3. As I have said, the claims transmission system was put in place last year using a determination which did not require to be tabled and was not disallowable. In that determination were certain discretions which resulted in the possibility of pharmacists having their livelihoods affected if the claims transmission process, or the equipment they were using, was deemed to be not adequate by the manager of the Health Insurance Commission. There was no right of appeal. A number of other concerns were raised. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to this, the Minister has put into the National Health Act the implementation of the claims transmission system as it now will stand under section 99aaa, which is an instrument that requires to be tabled and is disallowable. However, on advice that I have received, it would still be possible for other methods or systems to be brought in under section 98c (1) (b) in order to preclude that and to ensure that parliament is able to scrutinise the legislation adequately, especially the implementation of any similar system.

<PARA> 4. After clause 17, page 11, add the following clause. </PARA>
<PARA> ``18. After section 135a of the Principal Act, the following sections are inserted:</PARA>
<PARA>Issue of privacy guidelines for the conduct of the Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefit Program</PARA>
<PARA> `135aa. (1) The Privacy Commissioner must,by notice in writing, issue guidelines for the conduct of the Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Programs. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) Guidelines under subsection (l) must be issued before 1 April 1992. Thereafter, the Privacy Commissioner may, from time to time, issue further guidelines to replace or vary any existing guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> `(3) The Privacy Commissioner must report to the Parliament any failure to issue guidelines in accordance with subsection (2) within 15 sitting days of 1 April 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> `(4) Any guidelines issued under this section are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> `(5) Section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 applies to guidelines issued under this section as if the following paragraph were inserted after paragraph (1) (a) of that section:</PARA>
<PARA> (aa) section 48 applies as if paragraph 48 (1) (b) were omitted and the following paragraph substituted:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the first day on which the guidelines are no longer liable to be disallowed; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) if the guidelines make provision for their commencement after that day-in accordance with that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> `(6) Any guidelines issued under this section shall include an outline of the procedures that must be followed to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the security of information transferred between the Commission and pharmacists or medical practitioners for the purpose of checking individuals' eligibility for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Program;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the separation of information relating to claims upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Program from information relating to claims upon the Medicare Benefits Program;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that all information relating to claims upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits or Medicare Benefits Programs is de-identified within five years of its receipt by the Commission, unless such information relates to a current action that is pending in relation to an individual;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) that the Commission uses the most up-to-date, available information when checking the eligibility of concessionary beneficiaries to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Program. </PARA>
<PARA> `(7) Before issuing guidelines under this section, the Privacy Commissioner shall take all reasonable steps to consult with all relevant organisations, including the Commission and representatives of the pharmacy and medical professions. </PARA>
<PARA> `(8) In this section, ``Medicare Benefit Program'' means the provision of a medicare benefit under Part II of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and ``Pharmaceutical Benefits Program'' means the supply of a pharmaceutical benefit under Part VII of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Breaches of the privacy guidelines</PARA>
<PARA> ``135ab. (1) A breach of the guidelines issued under section 135AA constitutes an act or practice involving interference with the privacy of an individual for the purposes of section 13 of the Privacy Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) An individual may complain to the Privacy Commissioner about an act or practice in relation to the operation of guidelines issued under section 135AA of this Act which may be an interference with the privacy of an individual. </PARA>
<PARA> `(3) In the event of a complaint being made by an individual, it shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of the Privacy Act 1988, which shall apply with such modifications as the circumstances require to the guidelines issued under section 135aa of this Act.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment introduces the requirement of the issuing of privacy guidelines for the conduct of Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits program, guidelines as provided by the Privacy Commissioner. It also provides for consultation regarding these guidelines to take place and enables those guidelines to be reviewed by Parliament. We were given assurances by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs that these guidelines would be in place, but as I said in the second reading debate, the implication of this legislation is that there is the potential for all Australian citizens to be required to produce evidence that they are eligible for a pharmaceutical benefit, whether it be a benefit as an Australian citizen or because they hold a beneficiary card that gives them a special benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, we thought it was imperative to include these privacy guidelines in the Act and also to enable the Privacy Act itself to be used if there were breaches of those privacy guidelines. It is an important amendment to this Bill and is something that really should have been addressed, rather than being left as a promise by the Minister. This acts to redress that and to make it able to be scrutinised by the Parliament. It assures the Australian public that this system will not come into place until the guidelines are firmly there and have been both scrutinised and approved by this Parliament, which is absolutely appropriate, and deemed to be adequate in our view to protect people's rights. </PARA>

<PARA> After clause 17, page 11, add the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``19. After section 139a of the Principal Act, the following section is inserted:</PARA>
<PARA>Evaluation of pharmaceutical eligibility checking systems</PARA>
<PARA> `139aa. Those parts of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991 which relate to the operation of dedicated computer facilities shall not come into effect until a joint inquiry of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General has reported to the Senate that in its assessment the relevant estimated savings, as claimed in the financial impact statement of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991, are realistic and that there is no other less personally intrusive system eligibility checking that could achieve equivalent savings.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of proposed new clause 19 is to overcome concerns about methods of checking eligibility. The coalition was not convinced by the evidence put forward by the Health Insurance Commission that there was no alternative method of checking eligibility. In fact, in one of the two committees that inquired into this matter, evidence was given that pharmacists do not always check the eligibility of their customers. They put onto their computer the customer's benefit number and, when the customer comes into the shop, they use that rather than checking the customer's card. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing this issue, the Privacy Commissioner queried the possibility of whether social security cards could have a higher integrity and be updated more quickly so that these measures might improve the situation thus ensuring that people were not given benefits to which they were not entitled. Other suggestions put forward involved improving the Health Insurance Commission's internal auditing procedures and improving the integrity of the social security fringe benefits cards. Another suggestion put forward in one of the committees was that the Department of Social Security demand the immediate return of all expired cards, and that there may be a possibility of checking eligibility at the time the prescription was written by the medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a possibility that an insistence ought to be made that pharmacists ought to check the expiry date of concession cards rather than just relying on their computers, and that there be an ability to take legal action against people who sought pharmaceutical benefits to which they were not entitled. Another possibility would be to give an incentive payment to pharmacists for undertaking those duties-a percentage per annum or some other estimate of the scripts of only those people who were entitled to benefits. This would encourage pharmacists to check people's entitlement benefits, given the fact that a certain percentage of people would have out of date cards. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that every alternative was explored. I believe that this idea came into someone's head in 1989 when we saw it in the form of the black box and, rather than looking at alternative means, people have been fairly determined to set in place a dedicated system for which the easiest way was followed. Often, it seems that the easiest way is taken because people say that the technology is in place, but in fact it may not necessarily be the best way always, and there may be other ways that are much less intrusive. We want to be convinced of that before we actually concede to this Bill. We think it is absolutely appropriate that a joint inquiry of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General report to the Senate and, in its assessment, show that the relevant estimated savings as claimed in the financial impact statement of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill are realistic and that there is no other less personally intrusive system of eligibility checking that would achieve equivalent savings. </PARA>
<PARA> We were not convinced of that fact in the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. It was quite evident from the minority report that those honourable senators were not assured by the Health Insurance Commission's answers to the questions, and we believe that this is an appropriate way of dealing with this issue. </PARA>

The ultimate test, that is, patient well-being, certainly had not been given the green light.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the examination by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, and as a result of subsequent data given to the Committee, considerable doubt has now been acknowledged by the Minister, departmental officials and others about the exact accuracy of the savings and costings. Therefore, the Opposition's amendment, as moved by my colleague Senator Patterson, provides a further mechanism to satisfy the Parliament that those savings can be achieved, whether by this scheme or an alternative less personally intrusive scheme as a result of a review to be conducted jointly by the Australian National Audit Office and the Department of Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this scheme is, I suppose, modelled on certain schemes operating in Canada, and the cost per script in such schemes there is well over 60c, so it is not a cheap operation. However, it is interesting that they are tending to walk away from those schemes. At the very time we are introducing a scheme of this nature, those in the Canadian provinces are tending to walk away from what we are now intending to put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that it will cause a significant additional work load burden for pharmacists who will be carrying out detailed work for the Health Insurance Commission without reward. Under the Government's proposal, pharmacists will have less time for patient counselling. I remind honourable senators that much of that counselling results in cheaper costs in that people do not subsequently go to doctors on routine matters which would bring about far higher costs for the Government if they did. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government claims that pharmacy users may not notice any change, this claim does not acknowledge down-time on the dedicated line-a problem not unfamiliar to those who use computer electronic transmission systems. Nor does this claim acknowledge the failure to regularly update the files of the Health Insurance Commission with input from the Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans Affairs or other departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is abominable that pharmacists, without reward, are being forced into the roles of policemen where they could face the embarrassment and wrath of customers who allege that they are entitled to the level of subsidy they seek, simply because part of the system has broken down. I think the Government should be very conscious of that embarrassment as a result of its inefficiency and problems in the line. They are not necessarily problems within the Health Insurance Commission-they could be within the Department of Social Security. The end result will be a problem for the pharmacist. I believe that there are alternative methods that should at least be evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA> This review by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance will provide the level of satisfaction that I believe is necessary, given the unsatisfactory state of the costings that were presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I believe that this is a proper role for the Senate and a proper request for the Senate to make. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been indicated by Opposition senators in all of their speeches, there is considerable concern about the accuracy of the Government's figures contained in its financial impact statement. It is because of that that we have moved this amendment, as Senator Patterson has indicated. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those parts of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991 which relate to the operation of dedicated computer facilities shall not come into effect until a joint inquiry of the Department of Finance and the Auditor General has reported to the Senate that in its assessment the relevant estimated savings, as claimed in the financial impact statement of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991, are realistic and that there is no other less personally intrusive system of eligibility checking that could achieve equivalent savings. </PARA>
<PARA>As is understood, the Senate will be looking forward to the report of the joint inquiry by the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General. I believe that this should have been done at an earlier stage-before the legislation was put to us-but as it has been put to us and as there has been an admission by the departments that this has not been done, we believe that the legislation should not come into effect until it has been undertaken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot agree to this amendment which has only just been circulated in the chamber but which I am finding a little difficult to come to grips with. Just on a technical level, it purports to amend parts of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. Normally, an amendment would be cast in terms of amending an Act or adding clauses to an Act. Presumably, if this Bill is given a second reading, it will become an Act. On a technical level I find it very hard to admit the validity of the drafting of this particular amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It refers to `those parts'-which parts? This legislation is to be passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and the Senate is now looking at amendments which do not refer to clauses of a Bill or to sections of an Act, but just those parts of a Bill which relate to the operation of certain dedicated computer facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> If one tries to identify those parts, they may be referring to clause 11 or clause 12-I am not sure. If they are the parts to which the honourable senator is referring-and I see that her advisers are as puzzled as I am-then I refer to the first amendment proposed by Senator Patterson in the Committee of the Whole which was accepted by the Committee. It provides that sections 11 and 12 are to commence on 1 July 1992 or the day after guidelines issued under section 135aa of the National Health Act have been approved in the same form by both Houses of Parliament, whichever is the later. Either the first amendment which was accepted in this Committee stands, or this particular provision stands but, if passed, they cannot stand together. </PARA>
<PARA> I would further say that, in effect, this amendment undoes the previous vote by the Senate to affirm the second reading of the Bill. The second reading debate dealt with this matter of the estimated savings to be gained by the devising and operation of this particular regime. Indeed, a second reading amendment agreed to in the chamber expressed misgivings about some of those costings and estimated savings, but the second reading was granted by the Senate. This amendment, which is a very peculiar one, seems to be trying to undo the second reading of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as to the departments that are asked to undertake a joint inquiry, the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General are being asked to make an assessment as to whether the relevant estimated savings are realistic and whether there is no other less personally intrusive system of eligibility checking which could achieve equivalent savings. If I was in a generous frame of mind, I might agree that the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General might make an assessment of the financial impact statement as to the relevant estimated savings. That is, perhaps, where their expertise might lie. </PARA>
<PARA> But those departments have no particular expertise to make a judgment-which the Government and the relevant portfolio Minister have made-concerning whether a less personally intrusive system of eligibility checking might achieve equivalent savings. That is a real policy question for the portfolio Minister on the advice of the Department, the Health Insurance Commission and others and, of course, on the advice of and after consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. That particular leg of what is being asked of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General is quite outside the scope of their true abilities and expertise. I think it would be unfair of the Senate, if it were minded to pass this particular amendment, to require that sort of policy judgement by those two departments. It is just not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> For all sorts of reasons I find that this purported amendment to the Bill is totally unsatisfactory in its drafting and in what it is trying to achieve, particularly in relation to Senator Patterson's amendment No. 1 which has been accepted already by this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, I do not think one leg of the task being asked of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General is an appropriate task. I would ask that further consideration be given to this matter in the Committee. Senator Patterson may wish to respond while I walk around, talk to a few people and work out what it is about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the Minister's argument holds that this amendment is at variance with our agreement to give the Bill a second reading. The Bill also contains a clause requiring that guidelines be provided. The amendment requires that a joint inquiry be carried out within 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that this matter has dragged on now for some time. I am to be convinced by anyone in the Department that urgency is involved. The issue of the first black box was raised in 1989. We were told in the Budget that it was supposed to be implemented in 1990. We were then told that the next start-up date would be June 1991. I discovered on Monday during the examination of this legislation by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-this was a revelation to me-that the start-up date would now be July 1992. So this has been going on from November 1989 and the start up date is now to be July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I need to be convinced that there is a need for great haste. I do not agree either that there is going to be a financial element in respect of this amendment. The amendment requires only that the Senate be convinced. A group of senators on the Committee were not convinced that the data was adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Minister that one possibility might be to adjourn the debate at this point to see whether we can come to terms with some technical changes to the amendment. I have been informed by a person who is much more experienced than I am that the words `Those parts' is a form that is used. As an aside, Senator Hill has informed me that he has written more legislation than I have. I have to concede that that is the case. He tells me that the term `Those parts' is used. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have not had adequate independent information. The Minister almost convinced me that the Department of Social Security ought to be involved. He suggested that Department might improve its card in order to ensure that the checking of eligibility is more reliable. </PARA>
<PARA> I stand to be convinced that the amendment cannot stand as it is presently drafted. It may be appropriate to adjourn this debate until a later hour this day so as this matter can be negotiated outside the chamber. I note that the Minister and I will be in the chamber discussing two or three other Bills. But that may be a solution to the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Debate on the National Health Amendment Bill 1991 is restricted not by guillotine but by the lateness of the hour. It almost always tends to be that legislation in the health area, especially legislation that relates to nursing homes, is pushed through in the last week of sittings. We have seen this happen over and over again. Education, nursing homes and hostel legislation gets shoved to the end of the list and we always deal with it at a very late hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, a whole host of legislation has had to be passed this session for it to be implemented on time. In the hurry to have this legislation passed, it has not been drafted as carefully as it could have been-not because the parliamentary draftspeople are not paying attention to what they are doing but simply because they do not have the time to spend on legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 of this Bill inserts new section 4aaa in the principal Act. This section classifies as adjusted fee government nursing homes those homes listed in schedule 3 of the principal Act and those that the Government may later prescribe for this purpose. The section also allows homes to be removed from the schedule by regulations. This is necessary in case any home wishes to cease to be an `adjusted fee government nursing home'. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, that is all very fine but the problem is that someone forgot about existing section 4aaa. I have been advised that it would not matter if the two sections existed side by side, although there would be some confusion when there was reference to either section. One might ask, `What was the section that was forgotten?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing section 4aaa provides for benefits to be continued to be supplied to certain classes of pensioners for six months after they cease being defined as a pensioner due to changed circumstances-for example, if they get a job. Poor drafting, as I said, most probably due to time constraints, could have put these benefits at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes a number of amendments to the National Health Act concerning nursing homes. The first one is associated with benefit arrangements for government nursing homes or adjusted fee nursing homes. These changes set up a small number of recently established State government nursing homes on the same funding basis for the care aggregate module (CAM) as all the non-government nursing homes. The standard aggregate module (SAM) component is lower than for the non-government nursing homes, presumably to take into account the return on investment factor included in non-government homes SAM. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth nursing home benefits paid in respect of the residents of government nursing homes have been frozen at November 1984 levels. As a Victorian, I am particularly concerned. Victoria has the largest number of residents in government nursing homes. I think there are something like 5,000 residents in Victorian government nursing homes and the next State has 2,500. I have kept a very keen eye on and I have a great interest in proposed changes to State government nursing homes. It seems that Victoria differs in every way from all the other States in terms of the number of people in nursing homes verses hostels. Out of 118 small rural nursing homes in Australia, 48 are in Victoria. Victoria also differs in respect of the number of residents in government nursing homes. Also, Victoria has more types of nursing homes than any other State. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, Victoria has differed. I am always keen to look very closely, not only because of my position as a shadow Parliamentary Secretary but because of my role as a Victorian senator, at any changes the Government brings in. Inevitably, they always affect Victoria in a very particular way. Let me go back: the nursing homes to become adjusted fee government nursing homes are listed in this Bill. This list will become a schedule to the Act. The benefit will apply from 1 January 1991 retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a story behind this change. There has been a long and bitter battle between the Federal and State departments over appropriate rates to be paid. The Victorian Government refused to open 11 facilities until an adjustment was made to the rates being proposed. The depleted Victorian Treasury-I do not need to talk about that; Mrs Kirner has admitted how bad it is-as well as pressure from some of the more militant industrial unionists involved in Victoria has meant that the case of these nursing homes has attracted a great deal of attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot complain, being a Victorian, but I wonder what deal has been done to have these Victorian homes opened. I would be interested to hear an explanation from the Minister as to why only Victorian homes have been included in the schedule and there are none from any other State. I note that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills indicated in its report that under section 4AAA (b) the Governor-General could add to the list of nursing homes provided in schedule 3. In addition, pursuant to proposed new section 4AAA (2), the Governor-General could also omit nursing homes from schedule 3 by way of regulation. This is what is known, to all of us who are familiar with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, as a Henry VIII clause; that is, primary legislation can be amended by subordinate legislation. The Committee expressed its concern that the legislation could be amended in this way and considered it a possible breach of one of the Committee's principles. </PARA>
<PARA> I also noted in the Scrutiny of Bills report that various provisions of the Bill were to have commenced on 1 January 1991; that is, they have an element of retrospectivity. The explanatory memorandum states that this is to comply with a commitment given by the Government and ensures that these homes do not lose the benefit of the higher funding due to the time taken to amend the legislation. This is yet another example of legislation by press release. I do not understand why the necessary amendments to the Act could not have been made earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of this session, I remember that we were scratching around, looking for legislation. Looking at the background of exempt home charges, the exempt bed nursing homes provide a higher level of service than other homes and charge higher fees. A lower Commonwealth benefit is paid in respect of exempt homes. These homes are not numerous. In the first year of operation of the exempt homes provision, approximately one per cent of nursing home beds were exempt; that is, 838 exempt beds only. When we debated this issue, the Government put forward the proposal at the beginning that there would be exempt beds within ordinary nursing homes. This would have enabled people in rural areas to have access to exempt beds but, as it is now, it is almost impossible for a person in a rural area to have access to an exempt bed unless he is in a large rural centre. Many nursing homes are the only ones in the township and they would not apply for exempt bed status. This has precluded many of the citizens of that town going into a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> The bureaucrats and the Government decided that one way to solve this situation would be to have exempt bed nursing homes in toto. The Government set a target of 6 per cent of nursing home beds. When the exempt homes provision was introduced it was decided that, unless the residents elected otherwise, they could maintain their non-exempt status for a period of two years after the bed became an exempt bed. Where a resident elected to become an exempt patient, the bed became exempt, and the resident was required to contribute a greater amount. As always, when legislation is not thought through in detail, we always strike problems somewhere down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will allow people who are resident in a home, when its beds are granted exempt status, to remain there permanently without paying any additional contribution if they choose. Currently, the choice to become an exempt resident must be made within six months of the beds being granted exempt status. The Bill will allow people to again exercise this choice after the home's beds have been exempt for two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since the inception of the exempt homes provisions, there have been problems. As I said, when the original proposal went through Parliament, the coalition allowed it to go through but we believed, and I think we indicated, that there were a number of problems which needed to be sorted out along the way. Some of these problems do not seem to have been fixed. Applications for exempt homes have not been forthcoming. Basically, this is because proprietors are unsure about it. As we have seen, there are some changes that would make them even less sure. Also, when the applications are made, there seems to be some unnecessary delay in getting it onto the books. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of organisations have a number of major reservations with the change being made to the exempt homes provisions. Our consultations with the industry suggest that there has been a lack of consultation by the department with these people. That is why we suggested that the Bill be examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The outcome of the Committee was that the Bill stand as printed. This was not before serious reservations were expressed by the industry that the current exempt home provisions were not adequate and that the changes in the Bill will not make it more attractive for nursing home proprietors to make an application for exempt home status. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry groups have said that the proposal enabling existing residents of nursing homes granted exempt home status to remain in that nursing home without paying the additional fee if they choose not to means that a facility will be forced to operate indefinitely with an unknown financial liability as part of the financial arrangement. The open-ended proposal will make it difficult for nursing home proprietors to plan financially. The effect of this proposal is that after two years of receiving exempt status, a nursing home-and I must admit in an extreme case-could end up with every resident in a nursing home saying that he or she does not wish to pay the higher fee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has claimed that, in reality, there is only a small percentage of residents who would still be resident in a nursing home after two years and who may not elect to become exempt residents. However, figures supplied by the industry show that 33 per cent of residents stay for more than two years. Therefore, the point about the difficulty of planning is quite valid. The whole argument ought to centre around the fact that an elderly person should be able to enter into a nursing home and pay an extra fee for an extra benefit. Some people are quite happy to pay the extra fee for extra services and provision should be made to facilitate their wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned before, I have concern about the number of exempt beds and lack of beds in rural areas. As I have said, there is a problem associated with this particular concept in rural areas. Because a nursing home cannot be granted exempt status if it is the only nursing home in an area, there is no opportunity for people to enter an exempt bed nursing home unless they move out of that area. This restriction is unfair on those in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the argument that a nursing home in a rural area cannot become exempt as it could restrict, as I said before, the freedom of people to move into nursing homes. But surely there must be a creative solution to this problem. The Government should be able to come up with a flexible solution so that those who have the ability to pay and choose to are able to do so and remain residents in their own local area. </PARA>
<PARA> The other proposal regarding exempt beds in this Bill is a situation in which an exempt home status is allowed to lapse. Residents who entered on the basis of the nursing home being exempt will be permitted to remain as exempt residents. The only problem with this proposal is that it may be impractical to provide additional services to the one-off resident. It is understood that residents have rights; but proprietors of nursing homes also have rights. It is beholden upon the Government and the industry to devise a solution which protects the rights of the resident, but gives the proprietor some surety in financial planning. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes an amendment in regard to the role of the community visitor. This remedies an error in the wording of the original proposal where the community visitor was given authority to check on the care being delivered within the home. The provision will be replaced so that community visitors may enter nursing homes to meet with patients. The Opposition supports this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also allows the Minister to take action against nursing homes which are not complying with standards of care. The standards do not present difficulties to the professional nurses in achieving quality care. Strengthening the Commonwealth's hand in ensuring that only quality care is acceptable, is an amendment acceptable to the Opposition. There are reasonable safeguards in the review and appeal processes that have been negotiated with the Commonwealth to ensure that proper professional standards and definitions will apply in the event of any disputes of judgment and application arising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also continues to provide additional funding to assist nursing homes to employ a registered nurse at all times. Only the smaller homes need this assistance. The funding formula is such that only these smaller homes receive it. Some small nursing homes are also receiving additional funding to assist them to achieve financial viability. The Bill retains the existing arrangements for determining eligibility and level of additional funding. It also allows this funding to be provided without the need to change the home's fees every month. The proposal relieves the administration of this measure and the Opposition supports both of them. </PARA>
<PARA> One other issue I wish to raise is the issue of capital funding of hostels. Hostels which had signed an agreement have had their funding arrangement continued at the agreed level and according to the funding formula of 60 : 30 : 10. In the Estimates Committee, I raised the issue of the Department in Victoria attempting to vary the terms of these signed agreements and this issue seems to have been resolved. However, those hostels that have not signed an agreement will not receive their funding in the proportions that they had expected. </PARA>
<PARA> I give the example of Bright Hospital. Bright Hospital was approached by the Department to set up a hostel. I know individual citizens in the community who gave considerable donations that many of them had struggled to put together to ensure that they had aged care in their own community. The hospital contacted me and said that it was hoping to be able to go ahead on the understanding that it was to get the funding in the ratio 60 : 30 : 10. The hospital has actually purchased the land. I do not know whether the first sod has actually been turned, but it has advised me that it is now re-evaluating its financial situation. As of about two days ago, the hospital said that it was not sure whether the project was financially viable. The hospital had entered into the project on the understanding that when the agreement was signed the basis of the funding would be 60 : 30 : 10. But because it has not signed the agreement it will be caught between two stools, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding arrangements have been varied because of a shortfall of funds for hostels. There has been an uptake of hostel funding. In the depressed economic climate, which has obviously impacted on the building industry, there has been a larger take-up of hostel building applications. This has placed strain on the Department's resources and the result has been the variation to funding conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is keen to seek the Minister's assurances that the funding arrangements will revert back to the original arrangements, especially for those hostels where negotiations have commenced with the Department. I do not know the non-sexist word for a gentleman's agreement, but it seems to me that when an organisation has commenced to negotiate with the Department there is a problem in varying the way in which it will get its funding. We hope that the funding will revert back to the original arrangements; that the variation will only apply to this financial year; and that the Minister will address the particular problems of those organisations which had commenced in good faith to take up the hospital beds that were offered on the basis that funding would be received in the ratio of 60 : 30 : 10. The varied arrangements are affecting the building of hostels and, in some instances, causing their deferment. As I said, the old arrangements would allow the hostels to plan again with some degree of confidence. I ask that the hostel at Bright be given special attention, because I know that it is in jeopardy as a result of this change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main purpose of the National Health Amendment Bill 1991 is to allow an increased Commonwealth nursing home benefit to be paid to a category of nursing home called `adjusted fee government nursing homes'. The Australian Democrats do not have any problems with these provisions. However, we do have a problem with the arrangements relating to exempt nursing homes. For the benefit of those honourable senators listening, I explain that exempt nursing homes provide a higher standard of care than does the normal nursing home. For example, exempt nursing homes often provide individual rooms with en suite facilities, perhaps a glass of wine with a meal, frequently air-conditioning, extra excursions and other benefits. I guess one could call them the luxury end of the market or the five star nursing homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government granted a number of nursing homes exempt status effective from February 1990. This involved about 840 beds. However, a difficulty has arisen where there are residents who are already in a nursing home when that nursing home upgrades around them-that is, when that nursing home becomes exempt. These people did not choose to enter an exempt home and pay the higher fee; they simply find themselves now living in the home when it is granted exempt status. </PARA>
<PARA> Under existing legislation they can stay in the home for two years after status is granted, but then they must either pay the higher fee or move out. In February 1992, residents who are unable or unwilling to pay the higher fee in those homes which were granted exempt status last year will be relocated at the proprietor's expense. This has caused some distress to those residents who could not afford the higher fee and have had to move out of the nursing home. This Bill changes the legislation and provides that in future when homes are granted exempt status people already resident in the home can stay there permanently without paying the higher contribution. This is a very sensible move and the Democrats welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the concerns of the nursing home industry. It is not fair to force a resident to move when they did not choose to enter an exempt home in the first place. After all, we are talking about very elderly people; people who are often bedridden or perhaps disabled; and people who have become considerably attached to that bed and that room which has become their home. There is a shortage of nursing home beds, so it is entirely possible that residents who find themselves in this situation would have to move to a home a considerable distance away from the area that they already live in, the area they know and the area where there is ready access for friends and relatives. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore support the amendments which will give substantial benefits to future residents in exempt homes. But I stress the word `future' because it does nothing to assist those residents who are in exempt nursing homes now and who will have to move out at the end of the two-year period if they cannot afford or are unwilling to pay the higher contribution. It is very difficult, as the Standing Committee on Community Affairs found, to ascertain the exact numbers involved. The Standing Committee on Community Affairs which looked at this Bill was advised by the Department that about 223 residents were presently in exempt homes still paying the standard fee. It appears, however, that some arrangements have been entered into for approximately half of these residents. The proprietor has said that they can stay on without paying the higher fee. We certainly congratulate those proprietors who have made a most humane decision. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this still leaves some 111 or 112 residents, as of today, who are facing the choice of paying the higher fee or of moving out in February. The Accommodation Rights Service (TARS) submitted to the Senate Standing Committee examples of such residents. One of the residents, aged 91, had been in the home for nearly 10 years and the other, aged 86, for eight years. As TARS observed, the average length of stay in a nursing home of between 21 and 23 months does not apply to all residents. This point was emphasised by Senator Patterson. The Accommodation Rights Service went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . with such length occupancy the residents no doubt would have built up quite a deal of attachment to these homes. The trauma of frail elderly people having to leave their nursing homes is well documented and it is something that we are concerned about should these residents have to confront a move. </PARA>
<PARA>I specifically quote from the Hansard of 7 June of the proceedings of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA>One client talks of the huge upheaval it would be to her father-in-law's life should he have to move. She feels that his inclination to illness in recent times could be psychologically based, in that he deduces that this might prevent the home moving him . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The same relatives also tells me of another very old frail resident in the home who gave her a note last August to the effect that the resident felt that within 18 months she will have to make sure she is dead. Our client thinks this is because of the worry that the resident will have no choice of staying at the nursing home because she couldn't afford to pay the higher fee. </PARA>
<PARA>The same nursing home has 143 of the 454 beds in its area. Our client queries how the existing residents are going to be relocated given that there are relatively so many of them and especially since it's a working class area. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we must remember that there is certainly some justification in the proprietor's concern, as Senator Patterson has outlined. But these residents have lived in these particular homes for many years, without any expectation, and certainly without any desire, that higher fees would need to be paid or that they would be able to pay them. They certainly had no knowledge of the fact that eventually they would have to make the choice of paying up or moving out. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, what has happened is that the Government did not really consider the ramifications of the legislation when it introduced the exempt home provisions. It has now got it right for future granting of exempt status but it is leaving the existing residents out on a limb. I have raised this issue with the Minister and his staff at length. We proposed this amendment and it was discussed in great detail. As the Minister rejected it, we then discussed another amendment which would have effectively put hardship provisions into this legislation. Unfortunately, that also was rejected, for similar reasons. I will go through the reasons which, unfortunately, we have to reject. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, changing the ground rules retrospectively is unfair to proprietors. There is an injustice here and I do have some sympathy for their position. But the original legislation meant a change in the ground rules that would be unfair to the residents. It will be at a cost to proprietors, but I suggest that a much greater cost will be borne by the residents concerned, who will have to leave their homes and adjust to others, and there is also the burden to be borne by their families, which will have to cope with all the traumas involved. It is also worth noting, as I mentioned earlier, that 100 or so residents are being permitted to remain in their exempt homes without paying higher fees. Obviously, some proprietors are willing to bear the additional cost, for what will mainly be, I imagine, a relatively short time. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Minister argued that any amendment would be unfair on those residents who have already moved out or agreed to pay the higher fee. Again, this is true. Those residents could certainly argue that they had been disadvantaged, but the Minister himself said that the existing legislation has caused distress, and Senator Tate noted that the current situation had caused very considerable anguish. Why not take this opportunity to ensure that it does not cause any further distress or anguish?</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government has said that it is not prepared to meet the costs of the proposal. We argue that these costs will be minimal. The Minister claims that the projected savings from the lower benefits that the Commonwealth pays for exempt residents have already been built into the financial estimates. I argue that that is a quite feeble excuse. We are not talking about a great sum of money-probably in the vicinity of $400,000 in the coming financial year-and, of course, we are talking about a very limited number of people. There will be no new or unexpected costs. There will be no other people able to join into this scheme. Obviously the numbers will not remain very high for years and years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot accept the Minister's reasons for declining to support our amendment. I do not think they stand up. I am disappointed that the Government could not see its way to preventing further distress to these residents and their families. However, I am pleased to note that the Minister has agreed to put in place an additional measure to help these residents. I quote from a letter of 9 June 1991 from the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples):</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has sought to address consumer concerns by amending the existing legislation. In addition I will ensure that the Department of Community Services and Health makes qualified staff available in January 1992, to assist any resident who is moving from an exempt home as a result of the legislation. The Department will be able to ensure that any move undertaken by a resident who has not already been placed will be as comfortable for the resident as possible, and that all residents are placed in new homes that will meet their wishes and needs. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been understood that it is the exempt nursing home's responsibility to find alternative care for these residents, and this understanding will remain. However, I understand the concerns expressed by you and trust that this additional arrangement will go a long way to address your concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>It does go a long way to addressing the Democrats' concerns, but we argue that it does not go far enough. Therefore, we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is anxious that the National Health Amendment Bill 1991 be given passage through the Senate this evening. As honourable senators have already pointed out, the Bill gives effect to a number of Government initiatives relating to nursing homes and to the domiciliary nursing care benefit. The particular matter which has attracted the attention and concern and the comment of honourable senators is those amendments which have as their purpose the payment of increased Commonwealth nursing home benefits to a special category of government nursing homes, to be referred to as `adjusted fee government nursing homes'. As honourable senators have remarked, under the existing legislation a resident in a nursing home at the time that it is given exempt bed status can remain in the home for two years after that date without paying an additional contribution. Beyond that period they are automatically classified as exempt and so must pay the additional contribution or leave the home. Of course, that creates great trauma and difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This provision has caused distress to many of the residents of the homes that were given exempt status last year and to their relatives. The Bill proposes changes to the legislation to allow residents of homes given exempt bed status in the future to stay permanently, without paying the additional exempt bed resident contribution. Obviously, that is a very welcome amendment to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> There are some other provisions in the Bill which are important. I refer in particular to the strengthening of the legal power of the Government to take action against nursing homes with poor standards of care. In a very small number of cases, nursing home proprietors have not provided the quality of life and care expected by the Government and, as taxpayers subsidise each resident in a nursing home an average $23,000 per year, it is essential that the Commonwealth be in a position to ensure accountability for the funds it makes available and, of course, to protect the rights and expectations of those particularly powerless members of our community who live in these homes. There are some other minor amendments that I need not dwell on. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lees has indicated a concern in relation to those residents in existing nursing homes. I understand that she will be moving an amendment to deal with that matter in the committee stage and I will comment on her amendment then. I commend the second reading of the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>As I outlined in the second reading debate, the effect of this amendment would mean that existing residents in exempt nursing homes would be able to stay. It would mean that the Government would pay part of that cost. It would still mean that there would be negotiation with the homes, because there would be the balance to be picked up by the proprietors. I recommend this to the Committee. I believe that it is the most humane way to cater for those 100 or so residents who are caught in a very difficult position and will have to make some very difficult decisions in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the concerns which have animated this amendment from the Democrats, but the Government cannot accept it because it would change the ground rules for exempt nursing homes retrospectively. This would make it very difficult for existing exempt nursing homes to generate sufficient income to meet the additional cost of upgrading their premises and services. It could also discourage other nursing homes from applying for exempt status if they feel that the rules will be changed retrospectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may also be said that the change would be unfair to the many residents who have already moved to another nursing home. Such residents may well claim justifiably that they have been misled by the Government in being told that their only choice was to pay or to leave. It is clear from the consideration of this matter by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs that the Government has demonstrated its willingness to listen to consumer concerns by introducing the amendments for new exempt homes as contained in the Bill. Some regard must be had, however, for the nursing homes industry's real concerns over the changes, and thus the Government does not believe it can go the whole way and make the changes retrospective. Nevertheless, I understand the concerns that have been expressed. I know that departmental staff will be made available to assist those remaining residents who may be required to find alternative accommodation. However, the Government cannot accept Senator Lees's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With some reluctance I have to say that the coalition will not be accepting the Australian Democrats' amendment. I can see merit in their argument, but I also see merit in the Government's argument that there is an element of retrospectivity. My sadness is that this was not thought through before. It is all very well in the rarefied atmosphere of Canberra and the rarefied atmosphere of the bureaucracy of Canberra to think up a wonderful scheme, but as I have said a number of times in this place, we tend to forget that there are real live people at the end of the process. When we were discussing this last week, there were 111 elderly residents of nursing homes-there may be 110 or 109 now- who will have to move as a result of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had confirmation; the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, has written to Senator Lees, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, saying that additional resources will be put in place to assist those residents who will be moving. We welcome that. There will be additional counselling, additional resources and staff to ensure that the transition of those residents into an appropriate nursing home is as smooth as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I can see the argument that those people who have already moved could say, for example-which is a suggestion I put forward in the committee-that since there were 111 people involved, perhaps the Government might look to addressing the issue of meeting the difference in the cost between the Government subsidy and the additional money that is charged by the exempt bed nursing home, which can be up to $10 a day. I can see the argument that if the Government were to do that-and it really would cost very little compared with some of the costs in the administrative services of this place-it would be wrong and a disadvantage for those people who move, in that had they known that that may be the case, they may have stayed on in the exempt bed nursing home, receiving the benefit of being in an exempt bed nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> With hindsight, we can always be wise, but I guess it is a lesson and it ought to be heeded by all of us in this place, that when legislation is rushed through, we sometimes lose sight of the implications for individuals. The bureaucrats sometimes lose sight of the implications for individuals, and this case is a perfect example of that. The Minister has gone some way in addressing our concerns, as I said, by providing additional people to assist the transition. I hope that if we hear from the industry that those transitions are impossible or very difficult-especially if there are problems with being able to find a nursing home within reasonable distance of the original nursing home-the Minister may in fact be able to use some discretion or bring the issue back to the Senate before the end of the specified time. </PARA>
<PARA> Given all those concerns, I will not support the amendment but I call on the Minister to honour the promise that he made and to ensure that the Department uses all the resources it has to ensure that those 111 people are transferred to another nursing home with all the respect and dignity that they deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to answer one comment made by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). Yes, there are certainly injustices. It is not fair to ask the proprietors to pick up additional amounts of money that they had not budgeted for. It is not fair on those who have decided to move and on those who have to pay the extra amount. It is not fair on either of those groups, but I think by far the greatest injustice now is on those who are caught.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that the amendment we were discussing at length with regard to hardship provisions would have catered for many of the concerns that Senator Patterson has and would have given this Parliament the ability to put into place a procedure whereby, if the counsellors found that there was a major problem and hardship could be established-in other words, the elderly residents genuinely had no assets, no property that could be sold or no other means by which they could raise the money to stay-then the Minister could have allowed for them to stay and the cost to be met. I stress that the costs are very, very low when one looks at the overall health budget. I wonder what the costs are now going to be for the additional staff.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a marathon, Madam Acting Deputy President. The National Food Authority Bill 1991, which we are debating this evening, has been introduced by the Government to implement an important series of reforms in the food regulatory system that were recommended at the Australian health Ministers conference in June last year and agreed to at the Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in October 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major reforms agreed to at the Special Premiers Conference were that uniform food standards would apply across the nation and be regulated by a National Food Authority (NFA). This is instead of the current mishmash of Federal and State legislation that has resulted in standards differing across Australia. All one needs to do to get an idea of the bureaucratic nightmare that currently exists is to examine one of the charts showing the consultative process for making changes to the food standards code. I have one here that comes from the Australian Rural Times of 12 September 1990 and we see here a plethora of groups: the National Health and Medical Research Council; the National Food Standards Council; the Commonwealth and State government departments which include the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs; and the Department of Community Services and Health. I will not go on because it is getting late, but we had a plethora of groups that required consultation and agreement for a process for change to the food standards code. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of these reforms is to achieve the substantial efficiencies in food production and distribution gained from uniform food standards throughout Australia. In addition it is also important for our export markets. Public health and safety remain the primary objectives in setting food standards. However, the National Food Authority will have regard to the promotion of consistency with standards applied to food in international trade, as I just mentioned. The aim of this objective is to seek the benefits to be gained from greater international harmonisation of food standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the complaints that have been levelled at the present system include: a lack of uniform national standards; a lack of clear objectives; excessively complex and rigid standards; too long a period of time taken to vary standards; a lack of consistency in decisions; inability of the public to make submissions; administrative inefficiencies; and barriers to reducing inefficiencies which are an impediment to the development of our food export industry. These complaints were echoed by the Commonwealth Business Regulation Review Unit (BRRU) in its 1988 report on the effect of food industry regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The food industry is a major component of a manufacturing sector comprising about one-fifth of manufacturing production. It is a major source of exports. Both exports and imports of processed foods are valued at about $1 billion, accounting for about 3 per cent of total trade. Exports comprise about 7 per cent of the processed food sector's turnover. The report stated that it would appear that Australia's share of the world market for processed foods is small and has been declining in recent years. The BRRU report said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is a lack of definition of the objectives of food regulation. This, together with an apparent predisposition against allowing increased scope for market forces, contributes to complexity and duplication . . . Some regulations can be identified as having been designed to inhibit competition. More important are those regulations which . . . have the effect of protecting some foods from competition. These interventions needlessly add costs to the food industry, raise prices and tend to direct rivalry towards traditional rather than innovatory products. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of these concerns were also noted in the Industries Assistance Commission's 1989 report on the food processing and beverages industries. The following examples illustrate the problems that have plagued our food regulatory system. </PARA>
<PARA> The first relates to jam. It seems amazing to me that in this job one has to know about SAM, CAM-and now jam. The firm concerned decided that it wanted to make jam with more fruit and less sugar. But, according to Australia's food regulations, there is no such thing as high fruit, low sugar jam. The regulation sets out in great detail what jam is, and only products that meet that standard can be called jam. So if one makes something with more fruit and less sugar, that is up to those concerned, but they cannot call it jam. This would put them at some disadvantage in the market. Then if they ask for the standard to be reviewed, it takes a minimum of 15 months. In the meantime one's competitors will have prepared their defences. </PARA>
<PARA> Another product is orange juice. A new form of technology allowed the extraction of juice from the skin of an orange. The problem was that orange juice was defined in the food standards as coming from the inside of the orange. Therefore, orange juice extracted by the new, cheaper method could not be sold as orange juice. There was fear among Australian orange juice manufacturers that their market share would be lost to imports made by the new method. There are many other examples, and I will not bore the Senate with them tonight, but they include margarine, crumbed fish fillets, ice cream and bread. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes to the food regulatory system should ensure that these inadequacies will be removed from the system. The Bill sets up an independent statutory authority, the National Food Authority (NFA), and sets out its functions, powers and objectives. The coalition would normally oppose the establishment of another statutory authority, but in this instance we believe there are significant benefits to be gained through the setting up of an authority that will develop and set standards on a national basis. </PARA>
<PARA> An agreement between the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments will ensure the adoption of food standards that are recommended by the NFA and agreed to by a majority decision of the National Foods Standards Council. I understand that there will be provision in the agreement for a deviation from a standard by a State or Territory where exceptional environmental conditions apply in that State. Negotiations are under way for the inclusion of an additional clause allowing for the deviation in public health emergencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the NFA in developing and varying standards are set out in the Bill. The NFA must have regard to the following objectives in descending priority order. These are the protection of public health and safety; the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices; the promotion of fair trading in food; the promotion of trade in commerce in the food industry; and the promotion of consistency with standards applied to food in international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular objective causing some concern, which was subject to a great deal of discussion in the Senate Community Affairs Committee hearing, is that of the promotion of consistency with standards applied to food in international trade. I have acknowledged the advantages that would accrue to Australia, if there were a greater level of consistency between Australian and international standards, but the concern is that Australian standards may fall. </PARA>
<PARA> With the possibility of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade being formalised in the future, Australia may have to fall in behind international standards, which may be lower. GATT has said it will adopt Codex standards, which are set by Codex Alimentarius Commission, a joint body of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation. There have been some differences between Codex standards and Australian standards, most notably in the area of pesticide residues. It is in this area that some groups are concerned that Codex standards will be adopted in Australia and that Australian standards may fall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, has given an assurance that Australian standards and quality will not fall. In the Committee hearing the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, also sought to give his assurance that Australian standards would not be lowered. He said that if our standards are higher than international standards:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they must be observed by anybody trying to compete with our food producers in Australia. Any food consumed in the Australian market has to meet our standards, not the Codex standards . . . Our standards will not be varied simply to meet a Codex standard. </PARA>
<PARA>An important point to note is that the NFA has been set up to work primarily towards the harmonisation of domestic standards between Australian States and Territories. There are significant advantages to Australian food exporters in reaching a greater degree of consistency in international food standards. However, there is some uncertainty and concern that Australia's food standards may fall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition accepts the Minister's assurances, but foreshadows that it will support an amendment to be moved by the Australian Democrats that will allow for the promotion of consistency with international standards and will ensure that Australian standards are not lowered. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill includes matters that may be included in standards and in variations in the standards. New and varied standards may relate to any of the following: the composition of food; the production of food; packaging, storage and handling; labelling or advertising; the interpretation of other standards; and other public health matters relating to food. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be interested to hear from the Minister why the matter of the maximum or minimum amounts of additives that must or may be used in the preparation of food is singled out and included in the production of food. I would be concerned if the effect was to limit matters that could be considered in the production of food. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise the matter of labelling. The Opposition believes it is important that the NFA consider the issue of country-of-origin labelling. The Opposition accepts an assurance from the Minister that he will direct the NFA to ensure the Authority maintains country-of-origin labelling provisions and that, as part of the review of standards, the provisions will be made consistent throughout the Food Standards Code. </PARA>
<PARA> The NFA is to be a body comprising five persons who are required to have experience or expertise in relevant fields, such as public health, food science, the food industry and consumer advocacy. They will be appointed by the Minister after he has consulted with the Australian Food Standards Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets a 12-month time limit for the NFA to make recommendations on new or varied standards. There is the ability to fast-track in certain circumstances and to grant additional time to the NFA to consider a new or varied standard. The coalition supports the time limits, particularly given the wholesale delays previously experienced in the food regulatory system. However, we question why the NFA is given 24 months to consider draft standards currently in the system instead of the 12 months for new applications. This seems to be unfair to applicants who have had their applications in for some time. I would be interested to hear from the Minister why there is this difference in the time limits, and would also seek an assurance from him that priority will be given to applications already in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I was somewhat bemused when I was told that, although there was provision in the Bill to charge fees relating to the performance of the NFA's functions, there was no intention to do so. I would be interested to hear from the Minister why this provision exists if the intention to charge fees is not present. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise the matter of the integration of food policy administration. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) comes under the control of the Department of Primary Industry and Energy. I understand that the role of the inspection of food imports will remain with AQIS, and AQIS will ensure that imported foods comply with the standards set by the NFA. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council will continue to set standards for maximum residue limits for agricultural and veterinary chemicals in food, and these standards will be recommended to the NFA for consideration. The coalition hopes that the different departments and authorities can work efficiently together to ensure that the objectives of the proposal are met and that we do not end up with a problem because of the lack of communication. The legislation is trying to reduce the problem we have had because of a lack of communication between different groups and we have to ensure that it does not, through a creeping effect, occur again. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the coalition, I will be moving an amendment to remove the provision that restricts the age of the Chairman of the National Food Authority to 65 years. The coalition believes that it is inappropriate to be excluded or removed from a position purely on the basis of age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Food Authority Bill 1991 establishes an Authority which will set and administer uniform food standards for all Australian States and Territories. It is to be an independent statutory body consisting of five people, including a full time Chair. Following agreements at the 1990 Premiers Conference, uniform food standards are to be achieved by the National Food Authority (NFA) presenting draft standards to the National Food Standards Council consisting of State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers responsible for food standards. The majority decision will then be adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The introduction of uniform standards is applauded and will be most beneficial to everyone involved in the food industry for the elimination of present complexity and duplication. However, some broad issues in this Bill give certain commodity groups some concern. The Bill requires the National Food Authority to pursue the objectives set out in the Bill. At the outset it needs to be said that Australia has always had a very high food standard. Our food products are also of very high quality. It is because of this high quality that Australian products command a premium price in world markets. It is also well known that the international quality market is an expanding market and Australia is well placed to retain its reputation in this market because of high quality products. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the new Authority's objectives will be to promote consistency with standards applied to food in international trade. International standards are based on the Codex Alimentarius Commission, a body of the United Nations. Therefore, these are the standards that the Authority will be aiming to coordinate with. Negotiations in the current Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are also aimed at these Codex standards being adopted as the basis of national standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of the harmonisation of national and international standards has been subject to much public debate in the United States of America (USA), with consumers and environmentalists being concerned that lower standards, particularly in relation to pesticides, will lead to lower quality food and increased environmental damage. In Australia, the Australian Consumers Association, meat inspectors and the Victorian Farmers Federation have joined forces over the common concern of lower standards as a result of this express Authority objective. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern that the Government, in rushing through this legislation, is imposing harmonisation and consequent lower standards on the Australian producer and consumer. Lower quality does mean lower cost for imported food products. Australian farmers and producers are losing large amounts of the market share from imported foodstuffs, which amounted to $2.134 billion last year. There are definite examples of Australian standards being lowered to allow trade to occur, such as with Chinese peanuts and chemical levels in seaweed. Furthermore, there is the ever present unfair trading situation with subsidised imports from the European Community (EC), the US and Thailand which is a continual burden for primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The trend with Australian farming has been to reduce the use of pesticides, yet compared to the Australian standards set by the National Health and Medical Research Council, Codex standards for the maximum residue limits for pesticide residues are lower in the majority of cases. For example, the Codex standard for 2,4,5,T for apricots and sugar is 25 times higher than the Australian standards. Fenthion in pigs and sheep is 10 times higher than the Australian standards. If standards were harmonised, imported goods would also be allowed in with these levels. This area of lower standards is where there is most concern at the Government's action in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective given to the new Authority is criticised because the Government has introduced harmonisation into the Australian standards by giving it to this Authority without the opportunity for public debate. The Government has given away another bargaining tool at the GATT Round by accepting the adoption of international standards when, overall, EC export subsidies remain unresolved and dreadfully damaging to our farmers. Any lowering of quality creates an unfair trading situation between lower quality imports and our high quality products. If we were to lower our quality, untold damage would be done to our products-both to the consumer and to the export customer-and it would allow a further flood of imported products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been considered by a Senate committee and this exact question on harmonisation was put to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate. The Minister has pointed out that harmonisation is on a descending list of objectives that the Authority has to be guided by. Nevertheless, it is in the Bill and therefore the National Food Authority has to consider this requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the argument is put that it is good for our export trade to comply with international standards, Australia already has exceedingly high standards and wins market share because of these high standards. The main problem lies with the damage done to our food production by cheaper imports and the fact that the Australian consumer will have to accept lower quality food. The Minister has said that the function of the National Food Authority is to determine standards for the consumption of all food in Australia. The Minister gave assurances to both the House of Representatives and a Senate committee that the National Food Authority standards would apply to all food consumed in Australia and that, despite the harmonisation objectives, Australian standards would not be lowered. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the Minister is trying to have two bob each way-we either have an NFA standard or a Codex standard; we cannot have a little bit of both. The Minister's assurances are appreciated-I know that Senator Tate is a man of integrity-but if assurances are to be given there seems to be no reason why these exact points could not have been incorporated in the Bill. Following the Minister's assurances, it is comforting that all high Australian standards set by the National Food Authority will be applied to imported food also. That is very important because we cannot have Australian processors, who are manufacturing at a very high standard which costs more money, and then allow imported food to come in under Codex standards. We would be playing on a very unlevel playing field if we allowed that to happen. I hope the Minister will pick up on that point in his response to the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australian standards are also applied to imported food, this will mean that all of the factors that the National Food Authority has to consider in setting standards will also apply to imported foods. These include maximum amounts of contaminants, residues, amounts of additives, storage, handling, labelling requirements, and any other health matters prescribed. The Minister has further assured us that no Australian standard will be lowered because of harmonisation. The Australian farmer is always trying to improve on quality and reduce the use of pesticides. Therefore, competing against lower quality products is becoming an increasingly real threat to the survival of many vegetable growers. Today I had occasion to tell the Senate about the increasing level of imported foodstuffs coming into Australia and how Edgell in Brisbane was forced to drop its price to Queensland pea growers by 12 per cent because of competition from subsidised imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers, producers and industry workers have further concerns about other aspects of the Bill and I make mention of them now. There is a concern that the promotion of food quality is not part of the Authority's role and that there should be a demonstrated technological need before any new food component, process or additive is introduced onto the Australian market. There is also concern that public hearings will be held only at the discretion of the Authority and that this may restrict certain information on public health and safety being revealed to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important area for the National Food Authority is that it may make standards for the labelling of food. We were told at a Senate committee hearing that under this Bill the Authority may decide in some instances to include country of origin on the label if it feels it is consistent with its objectives, but in other areas it might decide that it is not a relevant issue and will not include that in the labelling of a particular food. That certainly rings warning bells to me. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that at present all imported food must be labelled with the country of origin. To lessen any of those standards would be 100 per cent in opposition to what Senator Tate has said on a number of occasions in this Senate. He has told us that consumers deserve to have the right to know what product they are buying and in what country it is sourced. I note that Senator Tate nods his heads in affirmation. We are also told that the situation under present legislation is that food has to be labelled, and I have covered that. </PARA>
<PARA> Country of origin labelling affects the amount of imported food sold. In fact, it is my estimation that, if we had reasonable country of origin labelling, we would decrease imports by around 20 per cent. Most people will buy Australian products if they can see that they are processed in Australia. Labelling on imported food is important information to give to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the possibility that Australian standards may be lowered because of harmonisation is a concern, a fact that may in turn affect the quality of Australia's high quality food products and high quality exports. In conclusion, I believe that the setting up of a National Food Authority to set uniform standards, which is the main purpose of this Bill, is welcomed in that it will provide many overall benefits for all aspects of the food industry. It is to be hoped that the Minister's assurance on the Australian standards will always form part of the operations of the Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By comparison with the rest of the world, Australian consumers enjoy a wide variety of very high quality food. A national food authority which will develop and implement a uniform set of food standards across the country can only benefit Australian consumers by ensuring that our food and any imported food meet the highest possible standards. A national body to overhaul and administer food standards is long overdue. A coordinated national approach is more sensible and efficient than eight States and Territories going their own separate ways on food regulations, and I congratulate the States for ceding some of their powers in this area. The current process of developing standards is lengthy and complex, and any moves to streamline this procedure are welcome. The opportunity for public input into the setting of standards is also welcomed. However, the Australian Democrats are not convinced that the National Food Authority Bill in its present form will satisfy the high expectations that have been set for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian consumers, and indeed consumers worldwide, are becoming increasingly sophisticated. We demand to know, and have a right to know, a lot more about the food we eat, including how many additives it contains, whether there is a need for these additives and preservatives, the levels of pesticides or contaminants, and whether our food comes from Australian producers or foreign ones. We need to ensure that our high standards are not compromised or lowered by pressures from our trading partners, and we need to ensure that Australia does not become a dumping ground for inferior imported products. </PARA>
<PARA> Research in January this year by the Pratt research group in Sydney found that Australian consumers were noticeably less critical of the quality of most Australian products than they had been a few years previously. In some categories, such as primary produce, consumers often regarded Australian products as being superior. The survey also found that consumer support for many domestic primary produce industries had strengthened, particularly when these industries were adversely affected by competitive imports, such as the difficulties we saw facing citrus growers in competing with imported juice concentrates. </PARA>
<PARA> The study concluded that along with the renewed interest in buying Australian made products has come a greater tendency for the consumer to read product packaging to determine country of origin. This raises two vital issues that the National Food Authority Bill 1991 appears to ignore: first, the need for adequate country of origin labelling that will apply across the board to all food and, secondly, the often poorer quality of imported food. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats will be moving amendments to widen the powers of the Authority and give it clear objectives in relation to imported food. The Minister in the other place stressed the importance of the food industry to Australia. It is a major contributor to our health and well-being by providing us with safe and nutritious food and it employs nearly 200,000 people. It accounts for $30 billion a year in manufacturing turnover and exports amount to $8 1/2 billion a year-over 20 per cent of total Australian exports. Yet foreign dumping of foods is costing the Australian industry millions of dollars and threatening thousands of jobs, as alluded to by previous speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Australia's most efficient manufacturers, the canned fruit industry, has already lost 15 per cent of its retail market to cheaper dumped imports. Imports of canned peaches rose by more than 200 per cent last year. These products, often of inferior quality, are heavily subsidised and sold here at ridiculously low prices against which Australian manufacturers cannot even hope to compete. This not only leads to a loss of profits to Australian companies but also hits manufacturing workers and primary producers hard. We have heard a great deal about this over the last year that I have been in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently I read of yet another pineapple farmer in Queensland who has been forced to stop growing pineapples because he cannot compete with the cheaper imported products. This farmer pointed out that it is very hard to be efficient when he is paying decent wages at $9 per hour but overseas labour costs are less than $1 per hour. We have all heard the stories, I am sure, about imported Chinese peanuts and Japanese seaweed, which both contain high levels of chemical contamination and are not fit to be sold in many countries, yet which are accepted by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What is perhaps worse is that, when Australian consumers buy items such as these peanuts, they do not know they are buying the Chinese variety, as they may have been packed in Australia and therefore qualify as being `made in Australia'. The same goes for orange juice. Because it has Australian water in it, it is deemed to be a product of Australia. I think it is appalling that Australian consumers, who have already demonstrated a willingness to buy Australian-made products because of their superiority quality, and often as a protest against foreign dumping, do not know or are not able to tell whether they are getting the real thing because of inadequate labelling requirements. It is also appalling that Australian consumers do not know whether they are buying products that may not meet Australian standards and may contain high levels of pesticide or known carcinogens, and it is irresponsible of the Government to let this situation continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite many promises that we will get proper country of origin labelling, the action we have seen has resulted in the legislation before us tonight. The Democrats accept the written assurance of the Minister that he will direct the National Food Authority to ensure that it maintains country of origin labelling provisions. We were going to move an amendment to incorporate this as one of the Authority's functions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed that the National Food Authority will help the Australian food industry achieve its full export potential by promoting consistency between domestic and international food standards. Australian producers are encouraged to meet standards that are consistent with overseas requirements. As I mentioned at the outset of my speech, Australia has very high food standards compared with many other countries; it is a feature of our international marketing. Quality is high on the international consumer agenda. This Bill as it is currently worded implies that our high standards could be compromised or lowered to meet the standards of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals considered under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade suggest that international standards are being promoted as the universal standard and that countries such as Australia may be prevented from implementing higher standards under threat of sanctions which might be applied under GATT. The rights of consumers in matters of public health and safety should not be compromised because of commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the very real danger, as other speakers have said this evening, that Australian standards will be watered down to meet lower international standards. We have seen already evidence of this happening, and I refer again to the example of Japanese seaweed. This import was at first rejected because of high levels of arsenic. However, following pressure from certain quarters, a new standard was set and the seaweed was allowed entry. This watering down of our standards would not only be disastrous for Australian consumers, farmers, producers and manufacturers, but it would also undermine our export potential, the very thing the Government is trying to improve with the establishment of the National Food Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will be moving amendments to ensure that Australia's high standards will not be compromised or bartered for an increase in trade. The National Food Authority will develop policies in relation to imported food, yet the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service will implement these policies, and other Government departments will test imported food. Ideally, if we are to have uniform national food standards for both domestic and imported food, all these functions should eventually come under the control of the National Food Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other aspects of this Bill that the Australian Democrats believe will lead to a watering down of standards and a loss of consumer protection. The Bill sets out a series of objectives that the National Food Authority is to follow when setting or developing standards. These objectives, when compared with the objectives of current standard setting bodies, such as the National Health and Medical Research Council, appear to have been considerably weakened. The promotion of food quality is not one of the Authority's objectives. In fact, food is defined in the Bill as `any substance whether or not it is fit for human consumption'. </PARA>
<PARA> In its long history of food regulation, beginning with the pure food Act back in 1907, Australia has always had the primary objective of keeping our food pure. This means that there has had to be a technological need for any additives or preservatives before they were allowed to be included in a product. Australia differs from other countries, such as America, in that their food can have anything in it as long as it is not prohibited. It is this basic difference that I believe has allowed us to enjoy and export high quality food without unnecessary additives and chemical treatments that may have caused public concern overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> In its present form, the National Food Authority will not have this requirement to demonstrate a technological need, yet in February this year at a world food conference in Rome Australia gave a public commitment that technological need had to be a food standard requirement. Australia's official position on this appears to have changed, and perhaps the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) in his comments could tell me why. Technological need is also a requirement under the international standard body, Codex Alimentaris Commission, the very body with which Australia is keen to harmonise its standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority has also dropped objectives designed to promote food quality and to prevent deception and fraud. Without these objectives, I believe that our food could end up containing a whole new range of artificial colours, sweeteners and preservatives that, while benefiting the big manufacturers, will certainly not benefit consumers who are looking for less of these in their foods. These cheaper additives could be used purely for cosmetic purposes, to jazz up the appearance, taste or texture of a product without any concern for the technical need or health effects on a population that could be exposed to more and more substances in a wider range of products. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of additives for cosmetic purposes could also increase the possibility of deception or fraud. Prevention of this is a vital objective in terms of consumer protection and the rights of consumers to know exactly what they are getting in a product. Artificial colours are used extensively in food production, and these foods are labelled accordingly so that a consumer can check whether that product is artificially coloured. </PARA>
<PARA> It is generally agreed that it is undesirable to artificially colour primary produce, and not many consumers would suspect fresh food of being artificially coloured, but consumers are being deceived. South Australian prawns are artificially coloured to look like eastern prawns. As prawns are not easy things to stick a label on, consumers often are not aware of this deceptive practice, and I am sure that producers and retailers would like to keep it that way. If consumers were aware, some of them probably would not buy these prawns. Surely at the very least, consumers with this sort of interest have a right to know that this product does contain artificial colour. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other examples. Wine companies using oak chip essence to counterfeit the qualities of wine matured in oak casks is just one of them. So, consumers are concerned about the long term effects of those additives on their health. While something might have been found safe in the 1980s, it might be proven or suspected of causing health problems in the 1990s or beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers are also concerned about adverse health effects from combinations of these additives. More and more of the additives previously considered safe are being found to cause health problems such as asthma, allergic reactions and hyperactivity. It is no wonder that a growing number of community groups, such as Parents For Safe Food, are forming to try to educate the community and provide the information that many manufacturers refuse to supply under the guise that this information is commercially confidential. The pressures of competition combined with rapidly advancing technology can easily persuade manufacturers that there are cheaper and easier ways to make a product. That is why it is of utmost importance that objectives relating to technological need, the promotion of food quality and the prevention of deception and fraud be spelt out in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have a number of other concerns in relation to the fast tracking of standards and the lack of consumer representation within the structure of the Authority. Although it is an admirable ideal to try to get standards set up within 12 months, as there have been quite valid concerns from some manufacturers who have spent more than three years trying to get a product on the market, there are also dangers with this sort of time deadline. A prescribed time limit fails to take into account the varying complexity of food standards and there is no guarantee that the National Food Authority will always have the resources to adequately complete the evaluation within the time deadline. There is also the danger that public servants will be working primarily to meet a deadline rather than to meet the primary objectives of safety and consumer protection. The Bill allows for the time deadline to be reduced even further by regulation. I think that one way around this possible danger would be to ensure that one permanent member of the National Food Authority comes from a background of consumer rights and policy. We will be moving an amendment to that effect. That way at least, one person at the top of the hierarchy would be looking out for the consumers' interests. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a possibility that the National Food Authority, knowingly or not, could be stacked with people from backgrounds in public administration and food science. These people often are not even aware of the consumers' viewpoint. The food irradiation debate is a good example of this. The food processing industry and the scientists considered irradiation safe, and I do not think it ever occurred to them that consumers would object to the process. But we all know what happened when consumers did find out about this proposal, and we know that consumer pressure won out on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Food Authority's ability to hold public hearings is to be commended, as it will give consumers and interested parties direct input into the setting of standards; however, the Democrats are concerned about the restrictions on the publication of evidence given at these hearings and of public access to the hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> Closed hearings should be the exception and not the norm, and restrictions on disclosure need to be limited to truly commercially confidential information. Information relating to matters of public health and safety should not be kept from the public. Current industry practice classifies public health and safety information, such as amounts of pesticides and other toxicological data, as commercially confidential. This data, which is part of the standard setting process, is of legitimate scientific and public interest and should not, we believe, be kept secret. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the opportunity to end this practice and the Democrats will move amendments to deal with this matter. With this Bill we have the opportunity to bring about a number of reforms in the way our standards are formulated and the way that those standards will apply not just to all food across Australia but to all imported food as well. Because the good supply of quality food is one of our basic needs and rights, and because we are a lot more fortunate than many other people in this respect, it is vitally important that the National Food Authority be given clear objectives, functions and powers to ensure this. Consumers need to be protected from the large multi-national companies that want to put anything and everything in our food and want to replace natural ingredients with cheaper artificial counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude with an example of what could happen to a food that is close to some of our hearts-chocolate. It may not be a particularly nutritious food-although some advertisers would claim the opposite-but we still expect a certain level of quality in the product. Some countries sell chocolate that does not even contain cocoa or cocoa butter. Because these countries have virtually no food standards, their chocolate is made from artificial colouring, artificial chocolate flavouring and sugar substitutes, yet it is allowed to be sold as the real thing. Consumers have no way of telling the artificial product from the real one-until, I presume, they taste it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we water down our standards-and there are many aspects of the Bill before us that do this-we open the way not only for a flood of cheap imports but also for a dramatic fall in the quality of Australian products as reputable manufacturers are forced to use cheaper artificial ingredients. While large corporations that control food both in Australia and on the international market may welcome this weakening of standards, I do not believe that Australian consumers want to head down that road-they are much more sophisticated than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the National Food Authority Bill 1991. As senators have said, Australia has a very long and proud record in relation to food legislation. In fact, it was probably the first country in the world to enact pure-food legislation. So, the Senate is certainly standing with a very long and proud tradition in that regard while considering this Bill tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been emphasised by various senators, there is no doubt that the food processing industry, in particular, is very important to Australians. Of course, it is not only a major contributor to our health and well-being through the production of safe and nutritious food, it also employs many Australians. It represents the largest sector of our manufacturing industries-the food processing and beverage industries-and accounts for approximately 20 per cent, or in excess of $30 billion per year, of manufacturing turnover and employs some 173,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators will know that, as a major exporter of food, Australia exports $8.5 billion worth of food a year, which is over 20 per cent of total Australian exports. Many of those are low value added products. Of course, we need to process our food and put it onto the international market to obtain more revenue for Australia, and that ought to be undertaken. There is great potential, certainly in the Asian region, and we ought to pursue most vigorously those markets for value added and processed food. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic principles of the reforms that are being proposed tonight are to consolidate responsibility for domestic food standards development with the minimum number of decision making layers; to ensure uniformity between jurisdictions; to establish objectives for food standards; to promote coordination of domestic and international food standards; to ensure an open and publicly accountable arrangement which would allow input by interested parties and provide for public hearings, where appropriate; and, importantly, to retain the involvement of the States and Territories in standards development and administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The formal agreement between all heads of government in relation to the principles of this Bill to be adopted by the Commonwealth States and Territories, will be a most important step in the obtaining and retaining of the involvement of the States and Territories in this important matter. As is known to honourable senators, under the revised agreement presently being considered by the States and Territories, they will adopt food standards that have been recommended by the National Food Authority and agreed to by the National Food Standards Council by a majority decision. Anyway, that is the general principle on which we will be operating. </PARA>
<PARA> Several matters have been raised by honourable senators in the course of the second reading debate, and I suppose the international harmonisation question is the one that has attracted most interest here and in Friday's committee consideration. I simply repeat what I said at that committee and in Question Time in the Senate that, when one looks at the Bill, one sees that there are five objectives to which the National Food Authority has to have regard in setting its food standards. </PARA>
<PARA> They are: protection of public health and safety; provision of adequate information to enable consumers to make informed choices; promotion of fair trading in food; promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry; and, finally-and this is in descending order of priority-promotion of consistency with international food standards. It is the lowest priority matter to be taken into consideration by the National Food Authority when setting a standard. That means very clearly that there will be no harmonisation if such action would create a public health or safety risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kernot expressed a plea that the standard of public health and safety should not be compromised in the interests of international commercial interests-or an expression to that effect. Of course, that is precisely the way in which this particular clause in the Bill is structured-that public health and safety is the absolutely dominant concern. It has the first and overriding paramount priority in relation to the various criteria which the National Food Authority has to take into account. </PARA>
<PARA> If consistency with an international standard would do damage to the public health and safety criteria, as applied to particular food, then the international harmonisation has to be rejected in favour of the more stringent Australian standard securing greater public health and safety. For that matter, of course, if harmonisation would in some way detract from the promotion of fair trading in food, or the provision of adequate information to enable consumers to make informed choices, once again that harmonisation principle would have to be jettisoned in favour of the criterion which has a higher priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The main international body which develops food standards is the Codex Alimentarius Commission, a joint World Health Organisation-Food and Agriculture Organisation body in which Australia plays an active role. It is true that Australia currently adopts many Codex standards, as in most developed and even developing countries. But there are also many Codex provisions which Australia does not adopt. It is true-and I conceded and discussed this in the Friday committee-that under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), there will be more pressure to harmonise with Codex standards. But once again, within GATT, as within this Bill, any departure by Australia from the Codex standard which might be challenged by a country exporting to Australia, could be met with a defence if Australia could point to proper scientific reasons for the more stringent standard. Once again, as I say, within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade process, as within this Bill, it is recognised that health and safety have absolutely paramount priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell was concerned about the application of the National Food Authority Bill to imported food. I know that he has requested that I make a statement on this matter, and I would like to do so. He required an explanation as to the absence of any specific reference to imported foods in the National Food Authority Bill. As I said to the committee on Friday, and have repeated, all food to be consumed in Australia-whether grown or processed here in the marketplace from Australian farmers, orchardists, fisher persons or others, or imported into Australia-has to conform to the National Food Authority standard. The words in the Bill's long title are:</PARA>
<PARA>A BILL FOR An Act to establish a National Food Authority with functions relating to the development of food standards, and for related purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>It needs to be clearly understood that the food standards developed by the National Food Authority are not given any legal effect by the Bill. It merely provides a legislative control procedure whereby food standards can be recommended to a council of Ministers representing all the Crown jurisdictions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Food standards are given legal effect under State and Territory food legislation. Uniformity of food standards is dependent on State and Territory agreement to enact, whether by reference or otherwise, all decisions on food standards made by that ministerial council. I have already referred to the agreement that is being constructed to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> State and Territory food Acts apply to all food for sale, and as such all food for sale, including all imported food, is caught by the requirements of the food standards. There is thus no need for the Bill itself to specifically refer to imported foods, for the standards nevertheless apply to such food for sale in Australia. I just wish to put that on the record to assist Senator Boswell in dealing with his question in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that I can deal with most other matters as they come up in the committee stage. The purpose of clause 71-that is, the 24 months clause-is to ensure that the entire backlog of food standards work is cleared within two years. I believe Senator Patterson raised this. That does not mean that all new applications will be given priority over matters already in the system. The Authority will be reviewing all applications before it, including those inherited from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and will allocate its priorities according to its judgment of the relative importance of all the applications. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons with an interest in a matter submitted to the NHMRC could always approach the Authority seeking priority consideration. Should they not be satisfied with the result, it will be open to them to withdraw the application and resubmit it to the Authority under the new scheme, thereby attracting the shorter timeframe. As I have said, I believe I can deal with other matters during the course of the committee stage consideration of this Bill, and I commend the second reading to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>1. Clause 3, page 2, line 22, definition of `confidential commercial information', omit the definition, insert the following definition: `` `confidential commercial information', in relation to food, means a trade secret relating to food;''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats in this amendment are seeking to delete the definition of `confidential commercial information' in clause 3 of this National Food Authority Bill 1991, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) any other information relating to food that has a commercial value that would be, or could reasonably be expected to be, destroyed or diminished if the information were disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA>We think it is too broad a definition because it could cover virtually anything, including public health and safety information. Current industry practice classifies public health and safety information, such as amounts of pesticides and other toxicological data, as commercially confidential. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, this data, which is part of the standard-setting process, is of legitimate scientific and public interest and should not be kept secret. Deleting this clause gives us an opportunity to end this practice. Companies applying for variations of standards should be required to make public the safety information on which they wish the public to accept that their products or processes are safe. </PARA>

<PARA> The first one is the prevention of deception and fraud, which is a criterion under the requirements of the present State food Acts. I have a copy of the New South Wales food Act here. The Democrats think that this criterion should be included in the National Food Authority's objectives. In my speech in the second reading debate I referred by way of example to the colouring of prawns. The Government has argued previously that prevention of deception and fraud is covered by other areas of the legislation. I accept that, but I do not think it is enough. If it is the Government's aim to prevent deception and fraud, I do not think it should have a problem with stating this outright as one of the Authority's objectives. This amendment will let the Authority determine whether a standard or a product could be considered deceptive before it is released rather than having the current situation where the consumer has to apply to the Authority or to the Trade Practices Commission to investigate whether it is deceptive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Committee reported progress on this Bill, it was considering an amendment which had been brought forward by Senator Patterson in Committee of the Whole and which had the effect of requiring a report from the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General to be made to both Houses of Parliament on the estimated savings contained in the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991. It asked that in that report there should be not only an estimate of the savings but also an evaluation of whether a less intrusive proposal for eligibility checking might be devised which could achieve the same sorts of savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regarded that particular clause as then drafted as being inadequate for what was sought to be achieved. Even if it had been adequate, as it probably now is, as it is drafted a little more stringently, I find the proposal a peculiar one, given that there had already been amendments accepted in the Committee of the Whole in relation to the commencement date of this legislation which was put in terms of a particular calendar date or the day after which privacy guidelines issued by the Privacy Commissioner had been approved by both Houses of Parliament, whichever was the later. </PARA>

<PARA>Clause 2, page 2, omit subclause (6), substitute the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(6) Paragraph 7(a), subsections 10(2) and (3), sections 11 and 12 and paragraphs 15(c) and (i) come into effect on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 1 July 1992; or</PARA>

<PARA> (c) the day after a joint inquiry of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General has reported to both Houses of Parliament that the estimated savings contained in the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991 are realistic estimates and that equivalent savings could not be obtained through the use of alternative eligibility checking systems which are no more intrusive than the eligibility checking proposal contained in the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> whichever is the later.''. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Department has carried out a thorough analysis of preparation for the implementation of this legislation, this process should be able to be undertaken with relative speed. We have not been convinced by the evidence-and I think the Minister even hinted that he had some doubt, that the $40m gross savings was a bit sloppy and a bit rubbery. If that research has been done appropriately, it should not take long to convince either the Auditor-General or the Department of Finance that this is a cost efficient way and the best way of carrying out this process. </PARA>
<PARA> I put on public record tonight that I do not really think that the way to operate is by saying to people, `If you have this amendment, then this is what will happen. If you go ahead and put forward this amendment, we will tell the pharmacists that it is your fault that there will be the introduction of eligibility checking immediately based on your suggestion'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it very clear to the Minister, to the advisers to Senator Staples and to the Health Insurance Commission that I have not suggested that eligibility checking should be used, using the current social security card. Those cards do not have integrity. A person can hold a current social security card and not be a current concessionary beneficiary. I have not suggested that. If people suggest that they will tell the pharmacists that they are now going to get them to check social security cards because that is what Senator Patterson suggested, the threats fell not on deaf ears-because I listened-but I will not be threatened. I will not have people tell me or my staff that the Health Insurance Commission will now march out. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, one of the Minister's advisers might look a little puzzled. The Minister commented about a puzzled look on the face of one of my advisers. It was not by the person who is looking puzzled, but my staff were told by two people that this is what would happen. I will not accept that that is a legitimate and proper way to go about doing business. I will not accept that my staff should be treated in that way. I do not think it is the way that people should conduct themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I put on the public record that what I said-and I will say it clearly-was that there may be alternative methods. One of them might be to use an improved social security card. That is not just a suggestion I have made; it is a suggestion that has been made by the Privacy Commissioner. The Pharmacy Guild, itself, said that there could be better ways of getting pharmacists to check eligibility. It is not some idea that I dreamed up in my head, and it is not an idea that can be implemented tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Department tells pharmacists that they are going to have to check eligibility and that if they make a mistake they will not get their payment, I think that is appalling and I will say so now. I believe that those people in the Health Insurance Commission with integrity, and those people in the Department who have been negotiating with me, will not do that. But that is what I have been told. </PARA>
<PARA> I put on the record so that the public and the pharmacists know, that that is not what I was saying. I am saying, given the intrusive nature of this procedure, that this amendment is justified completely by the Government, and the members of this Senate can see that it is justified. As I said, the minority report to the Finance Committee was not satisfied and that is my justification for this amendment. I will not tolerate being told that if this amendment goes through then the Health Insurance Commission would use eligibility checking and not pay pharmacists. It is an unfair impost on pharmacists. I do not accept that if it happens it is my fault, because I have never suggested it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to respond to the episode to which Senator Patterson has made some reference. I simply indicate very clearly that the instructions to officials were to try to come up with a draft of the proposed amendment which was sounder, as far as being suitable for incorporation in the Act, was concerned. Certainly, there was nothing in any instruction given by me as the responsible Minister which would have given any indication that such a course of action as Senator Patterson has described was to be undertaken in order to achieve any modification or different intent to be expressed in the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, all I can say is that if the episode did occur in the terms in which Senator Patterson has put it, in the somewhat heightened atmosphere of the last sitting night of this particular session, when people are under stress and strain, things can be said which can be regarded as being said more forcefully than was intended and perhaps in a bullying manner. These things can sometimes be said in tones of voice and with inflections which are not very well reproduced when they are reported either verbally to another person or some time later and recorded in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the committee does not press the requests for amendments made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed. </PARA>
<PARA>We have come to a sobering moment in the history of this legislation. We have come to a point at which, if the Committee does not support the motion I have just moved, a money Bill that has been before it will have been rejected twice. That is not a light matter. I therefore ask that the Committee support this motion at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided that the wool tax rate for 1991-92 should be set at 15 per cent, with 11 per cent going to debt reduction, 3.5 per cent to promotion and other purposes, and 0.5 per cent to research and development. The Government understands the difficulties in the rural sector at this time. However, it had to take a responsible decision on the rate of wool tax which balanced the need to maintain a viable woolgrowing industry while at the same time protecting the interests of all taxpayers by ensuring that the Commonwealth's contingent liability for the $2.57 billion debt of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) was not caught up. As the Government has explained repeatedly, the tax rate was but one part of an overall strategy for getting rid of the wool stockpile and the AWC debt. Any change to one part of the strategy places considerable pressure on all other components. </PARA>
<PARA> The House has referred the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991 back to the Senate, having rejected the Senate's request that it amend the wool tax rate to 10 per cent. For its part, the Wool Council of Australia has made available analyses undertaken on its behalf by ACIL Australia Pty Ltd that propose a wool tax of 12 per cent. There seems to be some confusion about the nature of the Government's commitment to facilitate a $200m commercial loan by the Wool Realisation Commission as an advance on the sale of its non-wool assets. I should make it clear that these funds are to be available for drawdown only in that context and not to retire debt, as was made clear in the media release of 30 April 1991 by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, this loan facility needs to be set in the context of the overriding Government requirement that the Commission will be required to manage the debt so as to reduce the liabilities outstanding at the end of each year by at least the amount required by the announced debt reduction schedule. This too, along with the debt reduction schedule, is set out in the 30 April media release. It is because of the way the $200m loan is included in the calculations prepared by ACIL on behalf of the Wool Council of Australia that it is able to derive a lower estimate of the wool tax required to meet the debt schedule than is suggested by the figures available to me. </PARA>
<PARA> The 10 per cent proposed by the Opposition is, in this context, even further removed from reality. The so-called balance sheet document tabled by the Opposition and on which it relies in arguing that that 10 per cent is manageable makes the same mistake as ACIL in the way it treats the Realisation Commission loan. It reflects the unrealistic view that it will be possible to sell $120m of non-wool assets in 1991-92, ignoring the very depressed state of the commercial property market and the best estimates of the current AWC, which owns and manages the properties now, that it does not expect to be able to sell more than $40m to $50m of property in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures available to me are based on $50m in non-wool asset sales. As well, the Opposition sees stock sales generating $74m. But the Government's strategy is based on minimal stock sales in 1991-92. To do otherwise will only serve to further depress woolgrowers' incomes. The Government has analysed and re-analysed the best data available. I acknowledge that since the 15 per cent rate was announced on 30 April some factors in the market have changed, such as higher than anticipated prices, lower production estimates for 1991-92 and lower expected AWC debt at 30 June. However, any decision to lower the 15 per cent rate from 1 July 1991 is based on some very big ifs: if prices are better than the expected 475c per kilogram next year; if production forecasts are accurate; if the economies of our major customer countries perform as we anticipate; and if, as was expected, the AWC can sell a certain amount of its woolstore assets in a depressed property market. </PARA>
<PARA> For every one per cent reduction in the wool tax rate in 1991-92 it is necessary to sell more wool to meet the debt reduction schedule. But selling more wool from the stockpile depresses the price. The combination of reducing the tax rate and selling more wool means that the Realisation Commission has less income available to meet its commitments. The more wool that is sold from the stockpile, the more prices are reduced, and this impacts on grower incomes. There is, therefore, a trade-off in terms of grower incomes between the level of wool tax and the depressing effects on the price of stockpile sales. Analysis has shown that farm cash income in the short term is lower under a low tax and high stock release strategy compared with a higher tax and lower stock release strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the competing objectives which I mentioned earlier: that is, keeping a viable industry but also protecting the Commonwealth contingent liability for debt. The more wool that has to be sold from the stockpile if the tax is too low, the more the viability of the industry is affected. The balance between the objectives is therefore upset, which is in no-one's interest. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, my colleague Mr Simon Crean, attempted to negotiate a sensible and prudent operative level of wool tax to apply in 1991-92, somewhat below the 15 per cent maximum rate set in the legislation, on the basis that the operative rate to apply from 1 July would be fixed by regulation. It would be easy for the Government to agree to a 10 per cent or 12 per cent wool tax now in the interests of getting the wool package through the Parliament. But that would be irresponsible and not in the best interests of the woolgrowing industry because it has attached to it a high probability that a higher wool tax would be needed next year, possibly back to 15 per cent or even greater. The Government is simply not prepared to play games with the livelihood of woolgrowers in this way. That is why the House of Representatives has rejected the Senate's request for a 10 per cent wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that it is recognised in this chamber that, if the Senate persists with its current attitude and fails to pass the package of wool industry Bills it has before it, the Government will have no option but to have the industry continue to operate under the Wool Marketing Act 1987 with the reserve price scheme in suspension under the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Act passed by the Parliament earlier this year. The Parliament needs to realise that in such circumstances 25 per cent remains the operative rate of wool tax. I commend my motion to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this evening those of us who were following this debate had the opportunity to listen to what was probably the first major speech by the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, in the House of Representatives. He contended that he had spent the last 48 hours rehearsing and getting briefed for his brief speech on this issue in the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, he has already proved to be an obstinate and unsympathetic Primary Industries Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have just heard from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), representing Mr Crean in this place, and he obviously spent some 48 minutes this evening rehearsing and getting briefed for his seven-minute speech on this issue. This evening Mr Crean levelled certain accusations at the stance taken by the Opposition on this matter. He accused us of trying to create a new scheme that was unworkable, unrealistic, unsustainable and irresponsible. Let me address each of the tenets that Mr Crean put. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as being unworkable, I contend-and I am sure that I am supported by all honourable senators on this side of the chamber, including the Australian Democrats-that there are achievable proposals at far less than the 15 per cent level proposed by the Government. We know that there is a better market situation than when the Government put its original estimates down, claiming some 914 million kilos production. The figure has now been downgraded to 881 million kilos. If we add to that our proposed 25 million kilo sale from the stockpile, that makes the 906 million kilos, which is eight million kilos less than the original estimate by the Government and which makes a mockery of its arguments about the figures and the proposals that it is looking at and the proposed impact of the sales from the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to being unrealistic, let me turn to the assets sales that have been called into question. The fundamental issue is: whose assets should be sold-the unproductive assets of the Australian Wool Corporation or the assets of the thousands of small growers throughout Australia? The Minister talked about a depressed real estate market. Let me ask the question: in a depressed market, who do we look after? Do we look after people? Labor looks after its big mates in any industry. Big mates again seem to have preoccupied the attention of the Government, and Labor ignores and overlooks the thousands of small growers throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, Senator Cook, this evening had a preoccupation with contingent liability. What a pity that this Labor Government, the Western Australian Labor Government, the Victorian Labor Government and the South Australian Labor Government for the last few years have never looked at contingent liability. The way in which the Government is looking at the industry is heartless and does not have any affinity with the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to unsustainability, let me quote the words that immediately followed that accusation by Mr Crean. He said that our arguments were unsustainable `in the process of restructuring the industry'. Let me stress that. He said, `in the process of restructuring the industry'. What is Labor's hidden agenda? Is it `perestroika-ing' Australia, restructuring Australia? We do not want a Russian economy focused on Australia or the wool industry. Simon Crean's first act as a Minister, after his elevation through the trade union movement, into Parliament and now to the primary industries portfolio, was to reverse all his principles of looking after people first. How quickly he has turned; he can now see things only as a bureaucratic Jim Hacker from Yes, Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to irresponsibility, it was contended that our proposals were not in the best interests of the industry. What rubbish! We have seen the recent actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Government, using the bula spirituality methodology to kill off Australia's major resource projects, so it is now surprising that the Prime Minister and the Australian Labor Party have not discovered another dreamtime creation spirit that espouses extra ties on primary industry. Perhaps the Prime Minister can ask the Resource Assessment Commission to act as his mystic on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook's threat of a 25 per cent tax needs to be thrown out the window. That can be changed tomorrow by way of regulation, and the Minister knows it. If he dares to go above the 15 per cent that he is proposing in the Government's Bills currently, he will stand condemned for absolute hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the flow on consequences of any of these actions and the effects on the hundreds and thousands of small supporting towns and communities throughout Australia? We have responded; we have looked at that issue; we have taken into account not only the financial figures that we can sustain but also the sociological, the personal, and all of those immediate matters that have to be addressed on behalf of remote and rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government contends that our figures are wrong and yet it has not tabled in either the previous debate or this one any substantive schedules, tables, facts or calculations. It has come in and shot down anyone else's submissions or proposals but it has not put anything else on the table to look at. With regard to the $200m interest free loan, we need also to look at what is now being said and compare that with what Minister Kerin said previously. Back in April of this year, in a press statement dated 30 April, Minister Kerin said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will facilitate a $200m interest free loan over two years as an advance on the sale of the property assets. This will enable the industry to maximise the return from property sales. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the reference to what Senator Cook has referred to tonight as `draw down only' facility? There is no reference to short term bridging finance. What was the hidden agenda? These figures impact on any calculation. A couple of days ago in the debate in this chamber I tabled figures that included the $200m in our calculations. We have now taken that $200m out of the table and recalculated the figures. The bottom line is still showing figures of 9.7 per cent, 9.2 per cent, and 8.7 per cent-under the 10 per cent proposed by the Opposition. With the leave of the Committee I ask that this table be incorporated also in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. There is pressure throughout the rural community. But, very importantly, the Minister has not addressed all of the components that properly apply. We need to continue to understand that the wool industry will not collapse tomorrow if the Government does not get its way. The wool industry is vibrant. The people who are involved in it have been there for as long as the history of Australia and they will continue to be there. What they need is our support, dedication and interest, not this playing of games for mates, with monopoly money running around the table, that Labor so often carries on with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<SPEECH PAGE="5260" SPEAKER="Bell Sen R.J." NAMEID="7U4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.48 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have reached a depressing situation here where the Parliament of Australia is unable to resolve a problem which confronts the great industry of Australia-the great industry which has a history spanning almost the entire period that our civilisation has been on this continent. Yet we are sitting here tonight throwing insults across the chamber, unable to come to a position which will assure the future of the great industry itself. It is bigger than any of us. It will remain despite our machinations and inability to solve this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will remain because Australia is uniquely qualified to grow wool. Australia has a comparative advantage over every other country on this planet in the growing of wool. It has the history, the expertise, the climate and the topography. With those things, here we sit doing our best to muck it up. I was hoping that this Government would stop fiddling about with the figures, would stop sitting in a prima donna fashion on one particular figure and could recognise that there have been many other figures which have applied in the history of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the history of our wool industry, there have been production levels and price levels which contradict the assertions made by the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). When trying to explain the position to me, the new Minister seemed to be particularly hung up on the idea that, if more production was released onto the market, there would be necessarily a reduction in the price received. That may be so in a number of economists' calculations and their clean, precise and neat supply and demand graphs. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry itself, however, is not neat and clean. It is a farm industry, and farm industry has a lot of movement in it. It is described in economists' terms as an industry that has a high elasticity of demand. It is also an industry that spans the globe. It is an international industry with impinging factors from all aspects of the international scene. It is a special industry that does not equate well to the neatness of economists' graphs. It is an industry in which there is often more emphasis on fashion emotion, trends and the weather than there is on what the latest figures in the economists' graphs show. That is why, when I was hoping that this Government would recognise that, I was expecting a little more than another set of graphs which could easily be disproved by the history of the industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is an industry which at times has had much greater production than it has now and, at the same time, a higher price level than it has now. That brings the nonsense to our new Minister's claim that, if more wool is released onto the market, the price necessarily falls. The huge number of other impinging factors should illustrate to anybody who knows our wool industry that that is so much nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> What did I expect to see from this Government rather than the magic 15 per cent, 12 per cent, 10 per cent, et cetera? I did not want to pick a box. I did not want to pick a number. I did not want to see a used car market, which is how I thought the Minister described it earlier tonight in the lower House. If that is what he thinks this industry is, that illustrates perfectly his inadequate understanding of our greatest industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told in the contribution of Senator Cook, the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in this chamber, that the Government does not have any other option. The Government does have options. If there had been imagination, creativity and a few basic recognitions brought to this problem, we would have seen more options. If we could have seen a recognition that the wool industry is not a used car market where the great negotiators meet and ask each other for their best offers, and meet somewhere in the middle, if we had seen a recognition that the wool industry responds not simply to manipulation of figures but to the things I described earlier such as fashion image, emotion and the weather, and if we had seen a recognition that this is a very special industry, perhaps we would have seen the creativity necessary from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, we saw confusion. That confusion has been described here. We picked on a figure of $200m. The Minister in this chamber introduced this argument about the $200m. What concerns me about that is there was some sort of confusion over what this $200m interest free loan facility was all about. I suggest that, if there is confusion, that confusion is directly the fault of the Government. If the Government is incapable of presenting to the people who have a vested interest in this industry, who are responsible for the future of the industry, an interpretation which is comprehensible to those people, that is as a result of the Government's inabilities. The growers' representative bodies and the coalition were unsure of what that $200m was all about. I thought I understood it after I asked the Minister's advisers, but to make certain, I asked for it in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling read the plain statement by Minister Kerin, and it seemed plain enough to me. But when I asked the Minister's office to translate that plain statement so that I could see where it belonged in the calculations, I received this response in writing:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bell,</PARA>
<PARA>The $200m is not $200m off the debt up front. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the loan is to give the AWC some interest free money to smooth their cash flows as and when needed-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that, `as and when needed'-</PARA>
<PARA>through the first two years. </PARA>
<PARA>As this money has to be paid back by the WRC, borrowing it all on 1 July 1991 would result in $200m debt to pay off and $200m new debt-or no change in total debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Do honourable senators understand this?</PARA>
<PARA>Without discussing the issue in depth with whoever the General Manager of WRC will be, I imagine that the $200m will be borrowed in bits and pieces to smooth the cash flows of wool tax and receipts from sales in and interest and capital repayments out. The logical way to go would be to borrow only what was needed as and when needed, because each borrowing creates new debt. </PARA>
<PARA>There would also be some cost involved in changing the nature of the debt package, eg getting a more advantageous mix of terms and currencies, and this interest free loan could be used to give the funds needed to do that in the first place. Borrowing to do something like that could in fact result in no further debt actually arising in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA>There is another sentence in that document, but it is irrelevant to the sense of it-if that makes sense to those who are listening. As far as I was concerned, I was just a little lost, and I am not at all surprised that there was some confusion about the purpose of the $200m. I prefer the statement attributed to Minister Kerin which was read earlier by Senator Tambling. Tonight, an interpretation was given to us which I am absolutely certain is not in accordance with the explanation I just read. </PARA>
<PARA> The confusion is further increased by the multitude of lists of tables and figures which were presented. When asked for, they were finally presented for the people who are supposed to be making a decision to take into account. It is not only the confusion over the major component of the $200m debt. There are other figures which have been presented to us to assist in our decision making. Quite often, the figures have emanated from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE). In pursuing that group and asking repeatedly for the sorts of figures that I thought were necessary to enable calculations to be made, I have consistently received changing figures. In discussions with the people with whom I have been asked to negotiate I have called them a series of `shifting sands'. It is upon those shifting sands that I have refused to accept that a firm 15 per cent is the only answer possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Take, for example, the ABARE figures which have attempted to indicate the best possible price to be achieved for clean wool per kilogram as sold on the open market internationally. Apart from the fact that I am absolutely certain that I heard a representative of that group give a figure around the 300c level at a Wool Council of Australia meeting some months ago, the recent set of figures started at a level of 435c, followed some time later by a figure of 450c, followed very recently by a figure of 475c and, just yesterday, a figure of 485c was introduced into the calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> The question I have for anyone who wants to try to make sense of this is: why is it we are asked to accept a fixed figure of 15 per cent in these shifting sands and amongst this confusion? I contend that while these figures are shifting there is the opportunity to bring about a different solution-a figure which was not fixed at 15 per cent but which was fixed to the future of the industry; a figure which recognised the history of the industry; and a figure which was not fixed but which was totally ignorant of the wool industry itself and of any special qualities that this great industry has. While I am confronted with those things, I am continually reminded that what this Government is unable to do is to reveal its understanding of our rural industries and of what is in fact best for them. A bureaucratic flavour runs through these things which does not reveal the capacity to deliver what the industry wants. </PARA>
<PARA> I must explain the dilemma in which the Democrats find themselves. It is a dilemma which I do not think should be envied by anyone in this country. I know that our dilemma is not as immediate and painful as many of the dilemmas in which our woolgrowers find themselves, but when we have to make a decision relative to them it causes considerable pain. That pain is not limited to intellectual pain or pain that gives one a headache because one has been here so long; it is a pain which is actually heartfelt. It is a pain that is delivered to us because, although I think there is every reason to be able to justify a figure of about 12 per cent and a combination of measures that were very similar to those that were recommended by the Vines Committee of inquiry into wool marketing, which paid a great deal more attention than 48 hours to the industry and which came up with recommendations that were endorsed at the time, we have been unable to convince sufficient people to have that passed through this place. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of any sort of creative package from the Government to endorse that or to help it along in any way, we are left with no other option. The Government says that it does not have any options. We do not have any-that is our invidious position-and in the absence of options we have to stay exactly where we are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard from the Minister tonight. Unfortunately, the Minister was not with us when we debated this Bill on Tuesday night. If he had been he would have heard us talk about the state that farmers are presently in. He would have heard that the average farm cash operating surplus for the next financial year is estimated to be minus $626. He would have heard that, while the Government says that it will not sell the assets of the Wool Corporation, that is what the Opposition is wishing to do. He would have heard us say, `When you are going broke you have to sell your assets'. To whom do those assets belong? They do not belong to the Government; they belong to the woolgrowers. The woolgrowers own the assets of the Australian Wool Corporation and the woolgrowers own the stockpile. When woolgrowers go broke-and there is no possible reason for anyone to doubt that when the average cash operating surplus will be over minus $600 for the next season-they sell their assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has said that they could not sell more than $40m. We were told that the assets were bringing in a 14 to 16 per cent interest rate. For heaven's sake, they are saleable now, there is no gainsaying that. Of course, what the Government is doing is threatening the lives of all those small woolgrowers, all the one-family farms whose average number of sheep is 3,600. This is a ridiculous situation when the Minister, straight from the union movement, comes in here and threatens, bullies, and says, `Unless you agree with the 15 per cent, unless this Senate withdraws the 10 per cent, we will put forward 25 per cent'. Minister, use that in your union movement; do what you like in your union movement; but do not try that in the Senate. It just does not work in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in my remarks this evening. Today I checked out the market to see how things were going. One thing I have noticed in the four weeks leading up to this debate is that things are improving in the marketplace. The figures that have been touted in this debate in the last few days I am sure would not have been sustainable seven or eight weeks ago, but they are definitely sustainable now, and they are getting more sustainable by the day. In fact, things have changed since we were here the other night. The market has risen by 2 per cent this week. I did not get that figure off the top of my head, I spoke to the wool manager of a woolbroking firm in Perth. He told me that type 78, which is 21 micron, was 844c a kilo clean; type 79, 22 micron, 695c; type 80, 23 micron, 559c. That is getting somewhere near what the floor price was before sales were cancelled in February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point he made was that the demand is right across the board for the wool on offer. It is not just on the better lines, the finer lines; it is right across the board. He also told me that Japan is dominating the market, but that Russia is in there in a fairly strong way and looks like remaining there. He also told me that China is in there in a pretty strong way. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, if they get the package; I will come to the package later on. I have been told that the strength is there and that there has been a 2 per cent rise this week. So since we debated this issue until 3.30 a.m. or so the other night our figures have improved. The situation is that we are getting total clearance. The only wool that is not being sold is from woolgrowers whose reserves are a little too high. Perhaps they have them too high because they are expecting a bigger rise next week. Furthermore, these prices are now 30 per cent above those on which we worked out our figures. It is plain mathematics; one can do it on the back of an envelope. The market can drop a long way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then there is the point which Mr Crean made in the other place tonight, and which Senator Cook has also made, that if wool from the stockpile goes on the market the price will drop. But something that the Minister in this chamber has failed to point out is that, because prices have come down since we did away with the reserve floor price, demand has grown. After all, wool once had a 5 per cent share of the world's fibre market, then with the high prices we had it went down to 3 per cent. That was the whole trouble. The stockpile built up, but as the prices have eased the flow is much faster. He forgot to mention that. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the selling of assets, let me once again strengthen the argument. As Senator Walters has already said, if we have solid assets returning 14 per cent they will be readily saleable. One of the advisers is smiling. Mr Crean said tonight: why sell on a depressed market? Mr Chairman, can you tell me what the market will be next year? I reckon that under this Government the property market will be greatly reduced in 12 months time from what it is now. That 14 per cent return provides a good chance to get out. That is where the best premium will come from, as it is a higher return. I have said in here before that when an organisation goes into a property that is already tenanted it could normally expect only a 6 or 7 per cent return and the rest would be picked up on the first renewal of the lease, but in this case we are starting with 14 per cent. Senator Cook knows nothing about property development, except from when he was running his unions and causing strikes. He knows that about it. I do not think Mr Crean knows much better. </PARA>

In the short time since the last debate I have faxed all the shires in Western Australia to alert them to what is going on and advised them to send faxes to the Government. The Democrats have been faxed enough; they have been targeted enough. I know that around 3,000 signatures came out of my effort, and Senator Crane would have generated just as many or more. That indicates the number of people who are behind us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook also knows that, as the Act now stands, the marketing system can continue till 1 July 1992. He has failed to tell us. He has threatened us, just as Mr Crean has threatened us, with a rate of 25 per cent. He knows, and Mr Crean should know, that 30 per cent, plus a 10 per cent levy, is the maximum. That figure can be set at any level up to 30 per cent. That is in the Act. The Government can do what it likes. It cannot threaten us by saying that, if we hold up the passage of this legislation, we will not have a marketing system or that the figure will be set at 25 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA> The point is that the woolgrowers of Australia are relying on us to make a suitable decision, the right decision to keep them in place. As has already been pointed out time and time again, the Government has to make up its mind whether it is going to sell the woolgrowers' assets in Melbourne or in the south of France, or wherever. It is better to sell these assets than sell up farmers in the bush, because they are the woolgrowers' assets and no-one else's assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, Mr Crean, in the other place, has not told us about the big package of redundancy he may have for employees of the Wool Corporation. Is the Government keeping the tax up to make a bigger package to sell the employees out? No-one has asked that question yet, but I request the Minister to answer it now. In conclusion, I urge the Government to think again before it turns down the request made on behalf of the growers that we get back to 10 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the occasion of what is a fairly significant debate for the wool industry, I wish to make a number of very brief observations in relation to the speech made by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). First, I note the Minister's somewhat penny-pinching attitude in relation to the wool industry, which strikes me as rather peculiar given that the Minister comes from a government which has recently spent, for example, $1.6 billion baling out its mates in Victoria as a result of their failed State Bank of Victoria. The Government has also given the Victorians over $200m in a special tax package and has recently approved a $300m increase in borrowings through the Australian Loan Council. Of course, there is a difference because there they were baling out friends and here they are baling out a productive Australian export industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems entirely hypocritical of this Government and of this Minister to come before the Committee today and say, `We cannot afford to give the wool industry a chance because we are going to watch where the pennies go'. It is not really the Government's pennies at all. What we are talking about is an industry which has made a long term contribution to Australia's economic strength and an industry which, given the right circumstances and the right opportunities, will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There was one aspect of the Minister's speech which I found particularly disturbing and that was his assertion-it was nothing more than an assertion-that it would be possible for only $50m of assets to be sold out of the Australian Wool Corporation because there is a depressed commercial property market. Maybe the Minister does not understand this, but there is a very depressed rural property market. The depression in prices of rural properties far exceeds the drop in prices of commercial properties in the city. </PARA>
<PARA> This has a number of very significant consequences. The first of those is that the value of the properties has gone down and therefore the availability of credit and finance to woolgrowers has necessarily contracted, because the amount of money that a bank is willing to lend to the woolgrower on security is based upon the valuation of the asset. As prices drop, the value of the assets drops and therefore the credit limit available to the woolgrower contracts as well. This has a particular significance when one notes that this year woolgrowers are looking at a negative net cash operating surplus. In other words, the average woolgrower is going to have to borrow just to keep the farm operating-not to put the food on the table or any of the other things that are necessary to maintain a family and to maintain dependants. However, money will not be available to those woolgrowers because, as a result of the policies of this Government, rural farm prices have dropped. </PARA>
<PARA> This drives the woolgrowers to the second desperate option, which is that, with no money available for them to borrow, they must sell. As we see in a very depressed rural property market, the equity that those wool growing families have built up-in some cases over generations-will be lost entirely. Therefore, we come to the very simple choice: do we ask the woolgrowers to go cap in hand to the banks, only to be turned away and forced to sell their properties, forced to give up the equity that their families have worked generations to produce; or do we say that the Corporation must sell its non-core assets?</PARA>
<PARA> There is no logic in the argument from the Minister that there will be only $50m of sales and no more. The estimates of the sales of the non-core assets of the Corporation which have been made by honourable senators on this side of the chamber and by the Opposition in the other place are entirely realistic and are based upon the fact that the commercial property market has declined. We have taken that into consideration and we have come up with a very reasonable figure of some $120m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister should not attempt finally to say to this Committee that unless we do what he wants, we will have to live with 25 per cent tax. As Senator Panizza has so eloquently said, there is no need for a 25 per cent tax. A 25 per cent tax forced on the wool industry when this Government could, by regulation, bring the tax down lower, is just an act of pure thuggery. It shows the Government's contempt for the wool industry. It shows its contempt for the deliberations of the Committee, and that is why we on this side of the chamber, the coalition and the Australian Democrats, will not stand for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard a lot in the debate so far tonight about graphs and forecasts for the sale of the existing stockpile and also about the property market and its fluctuations. What we have not heard much about is the plight of the woolgrowers themselves. Senator O'Chee just mentioned that to some degree. I have been listening to the farmers on this subject for a few weeks now. What I have heard over and over again is that farmers have said that they cannot possibly pay more than the 10 per cent. Thousands will be forced to leave their farms. The banks will foreclose on them. They will have to leave and sell out at very reduced prices, as Senator O'Chee just pointed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The worst thing that we can allow to happen to rural Australia is for the farmers to leave their farms. Rural Australia is in crisis, and I think some people in this place have not really got that message yet. There have already been huge problems in the wheat industry. Many of those same farmers who have had problems with the wheat industry are also woolgrowers. Environmentally and socially we cannot afford to allow Australia's farmers to be forced from their farms. Environmentally it is a disaster. The land degradation which has already been a huge problem in this country will only be worsened by woolgrowers and farmers being forced off their land. They must stay there. The best that we can possibly do is to encourage farmers to stay on their land and to look after it as they are increasingly doing. They are very aware of the fact that they have got to look after their land for future generations and that it cannot be degraded further. It will be degraded if farmers have to walk off their land in large numbers, and a tax greater than 10 per cent will ensure that that happens. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the social cost to farmers and their families? What about the costs to the country towns which depend upon the rural industry? I do not think the Government has really thought very much about the extra costs that will be incurred on the social welfare system by the break up of families, about the emotional stress and the social dislocation that will occur not only for woolgrowers but also for the country towns which revolve around the wool industry. We have not heard any kind of compassion expressed as far as that is concerned from the Government. The 15 per cent wool tax has been rejected by the Senate in favour of a 10 per cent tax, and the fact that the Government now comes back and says, `Okay. If you are not going to agree to the 15 per cent, you will cop the whole 25 per cent.', means that it does not understand that woolgrowers will be forced off the land. </PARA>
<PARA> This will force the woolgrowers who are able to remain on the land to refuse to pay, in solidarity with those who are forced off. I have heard this from a number of woolgrowers. They will not pay. So the Government has not got that message either: that it will be faced with what amounts to a massive riot from the rural community in Australia if it is not sensible and if it does not listen to reason in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot about the facts and the figures. All kinds of figures have been produced. Of course, it is a bit like the Bible. It can be used to prove anything. Statistics can be used to prove anything too, but I think in this situation what we have got to listen to is the voice of the farmers. They have told us over and over again that they cannot afford to pay more than 10 per cent. They will not be able to stay on their farms. They will not be able to continue as woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am speaking particularly about the small woolgrowers here, the mixed farmers. I think that we have a duty to rural Australia-a duty to the land which we cannot allow to degrade any further and a duty to the people who have been the backbone of the nation for so many generations to ensure that they do not have to leave their farms, which would cause massive social dislocation as well as further environmental degradation. I beg the Government not to be so pig-headed as to come back in here and say, `Okay. If you are not going to cop the 15 per cent, we will land you with the 25 per cent'. It is just not acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first observation that one must make concerns the presentation tonight in the House of Representatives on the occasion of the first foray of the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) into an agriculture debate. I found it arrogant, I found it harsh and I found it cruel. It showed little understanding of the situation that exists. It was just a knockdown exercise, not an exercise in understanding. One is forced to comment in the strongest possible terms about the threat that was inherent in what was said tonight, and it was also repeated by Senator Cook. They know full well that the 25 per cent figure is set by regulation. To threaten this Senate and to threaten the woolgrowers of this country is an absolute disgrace. It may be that there are still some unions in this country that can do it; but I am damn sure of one thing-I will not be intimidated by that sort of talk, and I am quite sure that that comment applies to all honourable senators on this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider for a moment what was said tonight in relation to redundancies. What a different story that is from what we hear about the waterfront or the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) inspectors in Victoria. There was this special allocation that was slipped through from the Federal Government to the Victorian Government last week. The Government adopts a series of double standards, which is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise what my colleagues and others have said here tonight about asset sales. As far as I am concerned, not one farm should be sold until such time as a proper assets sale program is put in place. After all, who owns those assets?</PARA>
<PARA> We also heard tonight in the comments made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy reference to the AWC-I was not too certain about whether he was talking about the Australian Wool Council or the Australian Wool Corporation. However, it does not really matter. Who has led this industry of ours into this mess, alongside Minister Kerin? Who has put the $1.8m of growers' funds that were supposed to devolve back to them at risk? Who were the managers of that? It was a combination of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Council. In these terms, that is what we are really talking about. That is where the advice is coming from and I cannot give much credibility to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this is a debate about figures, although I recognise the social implications that Senator Vallentine and others have talked about tonight, and they are very important. But it is worth looking at the figures. The Government will not give us any figures. It must have something to hide. It will not put them on the table. We have put ours on the table and the ACIL Australia figures are on the table. Why can we not see a full package? Let us consider what was said in the House of Representatives tonight. Minister Crean said that a figure of 14 per cent would raise $342m. From that, one can work out very easily that the total income from 881 million kilos next year would be of the order of $2.442 billion to $2.443 billion. Using those figures, that works out at a price of 277c a kilo greasy or 415c clean. That is an incredibly low figure to pick considering, first, what has occurred, secondly, the ABARE predictions and, thirdly, the situation that exists with the futures market. I will not read out all the figures and I seek leave to have some figures on the wool futures market incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. I just point out that the selling price from June 1991 to October 1992 ranges from 662c to 620c, and that is a very good indication of the fact that the world has confidence in the Australian wool industry. We should have confidence in the Australian wool industry and so should the Government, because that is what this exercise is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other set of figures which I think needs emphasising here. They were quoted by Senator Tambling tonight in terms of the picture that was painted by the Minister of depressing the market by the proposal of the coalition for sales of wool from the stockpile. I want to say that that 25 million kilos of wool we put in there to raise $74m, at 450c clean, is equal to 2.7 per cent of the total estimated production for this year. If one looks at the fact that the 914 million kilos has been taken down or readjusted backwards to 881 million kilos, that is a drop of 3.6 million kilos. The Vines Committee reports were predicated and put together on the basis of 914 million kilos. That still leaves a situation one per cent better off than when those figures were put together. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish my comments by saying that it is absolutely crucial to the future of this industry that the tax level which is put in place is realistic and sustainable. The coalition has put figures on the table which are sustainable. The knocking down of those figures has been based on emotion and unrealistic figures. I end by saying that there is no way in this place that we can be intimidated, as I said before, by the threat, `We will put a 25 per cent tax on you if you don't toe our line'. </PARA>

I was a bit concerned, however, when I heard the phrase `restructuring of this industry'. As I understand it, that was the phrase used by the Minister in the other place.

I would be very concerned about that because, as Senator Bell said, this is not an industry to which is to be applied with ease certain economic axioms, because there are all sorts of variables in this industry which are not present in some other industries with which we may be familiar. </PARA>

<PARA>Notes:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Repatriation General Hospitals, in common with other hospitals in Australia and elsewhere do not have systems available which would permit the detailed costing of occupied bed days and outpatient occasions of service. Occupied bed day costs are an average of inpatient costs over the whole hospital. To give a truer indication of overall treatment costs a conversion used in the health industry is to equate 5.75 occasions of service as the cost equivalent of an occupied bed day. The converted outpatient occasions of service are added to inpatient bed days to give the adjusted occupied bed days.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Given their derivation the percentages sought are identical for both occupied bed days and adjusted occupied bed days.</PARA>
<PARA>3. The percentages given are based on the total running costs of each Hospital for 1989/90.</PARA>
<PARA>4. Terms such as administration, services, supplies have widely differing meanings. Those chosen are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Salaries: include salaries, wages, overtime, superannuation, payments to visiting medical officers and Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA>Administrative salaries, including estimates for overtime, superannuation and Comcare have been outlined separately to help in estimating administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Operating expenses:</PARA>
<PARA> Admin:</PARA>
<PARA>office requisites and staff travel</PARA>
<PARA> Services:</PARA>
<PARA>fuel, light, power, vehicles, post and telephones</PARA>
<PARA> Supply:</PARA>
<PARA>central procurement, medical consumables, provisions, stores</PARA>
<PARA> Other:</PARA>
<PARA>repairs and maintenance, furniture, other expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>5. Expenditure on capital equipment is not included.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Generally there are fewer privately insured patients or compensation cases in Repatriation Institutions than in other similar acute care public hospitals. As a result more patients are provided treatment by hospital-salaried medical staff.</PARA>
