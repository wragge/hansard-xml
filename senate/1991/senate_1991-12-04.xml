<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I claim to have been misrepresented. In his speech concluding the second reading debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, Senator Bolkus claimed that I, presumably as Attorney-General in the Fraser Government, had no regard for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is totally untrue. If Senator Bolkus had really made a careful study of it he would have known it to be untrue. Presumably, these words were thrown away quite gratuitously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record shows that it was the Fraser Government&mdash;and it was my responsibility as the Attorney-General in that Government&mdash;which took the steps required to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by Australia. That was not something that had been achieved by the Whitlam Labor Government. It certainly was a matter which was high on the agenda of the Fraser Government. It was something that required a great deal of negotiation and discussion with the States to ensure that Australian laws&mdash;State and Federal&mdash;were in order so that we could make that ratification. After that process, as a government, we duly ratified the International Covenant and gave further effect to its operation in Australia by establishing the Human Rights Commission. That body was set up shortly afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this record of the Fraser Government and myself as Attorney-General in relation to human rights and civil liberties, we also introduced and passed through this Parliament, after a great deal of debate and lengthy consideration, the Freedom of Information Act. We also brought into operation the important legislation in relation to administrative review and the requirement of public servants and Ministers to give reasons for their decisions. So I have been totally misrepresented by what Senator Bolkus said in this debate. I would be happy to debate my record with that of Senator Bolkus on matters of human rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I claim to have been misrepresented. In Senator Durack claiming to have been misrepresented, I think some confusion might have emanated from what he may have taken me to have said this morning. I quoted what Senator Durack said on 14 February 1986. He said, `We will not join in an international covenant to bring human rights to everybody'. I made the point that, although Senator Durack had been a previous Attorney-General in a Liberal government, I thought it reflected on his attitude to human rights. I also went on to make some points about the Opposition's current attitude to international covenants in light of that. That might give Senator Durack a different flavour of what I said this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>As was mentioned by Senator Hill, we have had the extraordinary situation of a Bill being introduced into this place with 23 clauses and then some 37 amendments, followed by another 13 or so amendments. This Bill has been guillotined by the Labor Party, in conjunction with the Australian Democrats, in order to race something through, the effect of which would be to limit freedom of political expression and freedom of speech in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested to know what the Democrats intend to do about this. I refer to a letter sent to me by the previous Leader of the Democrats, Senator Powell, on 8 August in which, amongst other things, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the Government has finally accepted that it will not get its original proposal through and is prepared to stand by its commitment to disclosure.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be fascinated to see the Democrats' response, because this is what Senator Coulter seized upon to beat Senator Powell about the head with when he took over the leadership of his Party. It was something that was very important to individual Democrats in society and to the loose-knit interest groups that support the Australian Democrats. To try to rectify the position that Senator Powell found herself in, she made the remark to me in writing that `political advertising will not be banned', and now we have the Democrats coming in here making a deal with Senator Bolkus and the Labor Party to ban political advertising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Parer's motion because there is no doubt that there is a clear need to split the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill into two Bills. There cannot be proper consideration of these two quite disparate matters in the present Bill, as is evidenced by the extraordinary position changing of the Australian Democrats, which clearly relates to deal-doing rather than the merits of the issue. The merits of this case are quite clear, and the Opposition has stated that it is in favour of improving the political reporting of funding. There has been no resiling from the position that was outlined by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the Bill, which is clearly and distinctly separate, is one on which there is universal disagreement amongst the great bulk of Australians, judging not only from opinion polls but also from the representations made by interest groups, quite apart from the human rights considerations raised by a Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There is no doubt that the part of the Bill which relates to banning of political advertising does not have universal support. It is so strongly opposed by the Opposition that we wished to state how strongly we did oppose it by sitting here all night, in view of the undemocratic way in which the Government had put a guillotine on a Bill that relates to basic fundamental principles of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out, there is no doubt that the Australian Democrats at one stage purported to support the view that the Bill should be split and, as Senator Parer said, that political advertising would not be banned. This underlines the point that former Senator Puplick made in this place following another such remarkable change of heart by the Democrats. He said that he agreed totally with the view that the Australian Democrats could not be bought, because it was evident that they could only be hired by the hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case they&mdash;with the honourable exception, once again, of Senator Sowada&mdash;have been hired by the hour by the Labor Party for the purpose of getting this disgraceful legislation through this place, in exchange for 50 minutes of free time on television. I suppose that we should look at that free time and say, `Well, if the talking head is going to be Senator Coulter's, that could well be to our advantage'. But <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>they will be getting 50 minutes of free television advertising time&mdash;which they could not afford to buy because they do not have that kind of public support&mdash;because of the nature of the deal that they have done with the Labor Party to support this proposition. Of course, that is only if the legislation does succeed in any court challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Australian Democrats once again have changed their position. I outlined earlier, during the second reading debate, how former senators Macklin and Colin Mason, both Deputy Leaders of that Party, strongly supported the idea of political advertising but simply wanted to make certain that people involved in political advertising had the same burden as the rest of the community to make their advertising honest. One can sympathise with their objectives, even though their methods of achieving it may have been open to some discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances, I simply ask the Australian Democrats to go back once again to the principles of their Party, as enunciated by previous leaders and previous deputy leaders, and to support the motion now put up by Senator Parer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion that has been moved by Senator Parer. I think this motion is capable of being supported irrespective of the view that one might take on the question of a ban on electronic media advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two matters that are contained in the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, which Senator Parer seeks to divide, are disparate matters: one matter deals with the question of political advertising on the electronic media; and the other, the broad aspect of the Bill, deals with the question of disclosure of donations to political parties and candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the money that is paid to political candidates and to political parties can be used in a variety of ways. It can be used to support campaigns in other than the electronic media and, indeed, is so used and will be increasingly used if the political broadcasting provisions relating to the electronic media pass the Senate. The question of the overall expenditure of public and private moneys on political campaigns is a major concern of mine, whether that be through the electronic media or by other means; for example, if the political broadcasts aspect of the Bill goes through, by innumerable other means which have been canvassed during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which dealt with this issue some time ago and which went through all the aspects of political broadcasting and political advertising, I must say that I can see a difference between one aspect of the Bill and the other aspect. I mention that because those of us who were on that Committee know full well that considerable amounts of money were injected into party organisations which were not overtly for the campaign process but were utilised through third parties and by political parties, apart from the periods of the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we see the difference between these two particular matters. As I said, irrespective of one's view on the issues, one can come to the logical conclusion that the two matters are disparate and, therefore, that the motion by Senator Parer is worthy of support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us an alternative process&mdash;and this is what Senator Baume does not understand or does not want to understand&mdash;which moves us towards more honesty in advertising, because, through the mechanism of talking heads which must address the camera for a minimum of two minutes, we are more likely to get truth in political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the conclusion Senator Baume has drawn, what we are doing is perfectly consistent with what our former senators said, but it is achieved through a different mechanism. We are still committed to getting the greatest degree of truth and honesty in political advertising that we possibly can and to raising the level of political debate through television, which is absolutely abysmal. If the Opposition does not accept that, it simply cannot recognise proper and appropriate debate from the poor quality material which passes for political debate on our television screens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument was put by Senator Baume in a way which actually proves my point up to the hilt. He said that we are supporting this legislation because we will get more advertising under this regime than we could afford. In other words, he is saying that we are not entitled to the 11 per cent&mdash;which is related to the amount of support at the last election, and which under a fully democratic system would be the amount of advertising to which we would be properly and democratically entitled&mdash;because we could not afford it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. Senator Baume is still fighting the fights in this debate that were going on months ago instead of addressing the issues as they are before us at present. I am pleased to hear that the Opposition is really supporting the disclosure provisions, because it has been a bit weak-kneed on these provisions from time to time. Initially it said that it supported them; then it seemed to go to water. I am very pleased to hear that the Opposition is supporting them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also heard other statements, too. The Opposition is supporting disclosure. The differences relate to the other parts of the Bill. Those differences between the Government, the Democrats and the Opposition have been clearly delineated. We know where we are coming from and nothing more can be gained by going down this particular road. Clearly, the Opposition's agenda is simply to introduce a further and lengthy period of delay. There is nothing more than that involved in it. The situation for each party, the direction from which we are coming, is now absolutely clear. Let us, for heaven's sake, get on with the committee stage of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

I must give points to those on the other side of the House; they have tried every trick in the book to frustrate and delay. This is yet another one. I am sure that between now and 7.30 tonight we will find other little gems thrown up at us. Government members have made it very clear from the start that the Bill represents a two-pronged attack on the particular problem we are addressing. That is encompassed by the two separate arms of the Bill. Policy wise, we need to have this addressed at one time in one particular piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The purpose of giving an instruction to the Committee of the Whole to split the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 is that it is our view that this Bill is made up of two parts which clearly can be differentiated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to disclosure, from the beginning the coalition has made it quite clear, and we have been absolutely consistent, that we will support disclosure of donations to political parties on the condition that there is sufficient protection against intimidation by either a hostile government or third parties against a donor and that a donor is protected against coercion to make a donation to a political party. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is that the donations to political parties should be fair and equitable as regards the donors to those political parties. In the evidence provided to the Select Committee, it was patently obvious that the Australian Labor Party, because it is the political arm of the trade union movement, has substantial benefits available to it that are not available to any other political party in this country. The reason for that is the affiliation fees paid to the Labor Party. I know that the Labor Party disputes this figure, but on my own calculation it would appear that some $4m to $5m goes into Labor Party coffers. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, $4m to $5m goes into the coffers from affiliation fees. The reason why the unions affiliate is to enable them to influence policy and get ready access to Ministers. That was spelt out very clearly in the Cooke report relating to when the clerks union in Queensland decided to affiliate with the ALP&mdash;at a meeting, I might say, which Wayne Goss attended. He encouraged them to affiliate, simply to get the $30,000, I presume; but it also guaranteed them access to Ministers and an influence on policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is that the unions have a very protected position in our society in that any other investment by anyone else in the community is subject to normal taxation&mdash;land tax, capital gains tax and so on. These days the unions are no longer just organisations to look after their members; they have become very big business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the Opposition believes that the Bill should be split in the committee stage. We are totally opposed to anything that would infringe on political freedoms and freedom of speech in this country. It is very important that the young people of this country do not get themselves into a position where a government, as this Government is now doing, introduces a Bill which will not just stifle but kill all dissent during an election campaign. It would prevent anyone, whether they be in a Federal, State or local election, taking out an advertisement on a radio station. Radio advertising is the cheapest form of advertising within all of the media groups. It is cheaper than newspaper advertising and it is a lot cheaper than television advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, with the concurrence of the Democrats, is preventing people from taking out an advertisement during election campaigns. The Government will argue that advertisements can be taken out at other times of the year. What good is that? Who is interested in a person who might be running for the local shire or the local council outside an election campaign?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to disclosure. The Opposition will fully embrace disclosure, as made very clear by Dr Hewson. Irrespective of what Senator Coulter says about waffling, we have made that very clear from the outset. We have not deviated one bit. I wish I could say the same for the Democrats. The Democrats deviated not just last month or last week but deviate on a daily basis. It is impossible to understand the direction in which the Democrats are going. I notice that some of the proposals that the Democrats are putting, or not accepting from the Opposition point of view, do not even follow their policy. What does it all mean? It is totally beyond me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Parer's motion to split the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill in the committee stage. In doing so, I ask the Australian Democrats&mdash;I hope that they will respond&mdash;why it is so necessary to deal with both aspects of the Bill at this particular time. The Democrats, more than I, would be aware of the flood of protests that are coming into their offices at this very moment from people who are very concerned about the banning of free speech in this community. The protests are starting to flood in, as the Democrats would be aware.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It behoves Senator Kernot as a Queenslander to take heed of what the Queenslanders are saying. It just might be that all of those people who are protesting to the Democrats have a point. Why the unholy rush to deal with the Bill by 7.30 p.m. today?  Why could it not be put off so that Senator Kernot could consider those arguments, could consider the protests that have been made and could consider whether, possibly, some of the matters raised in the debate last night have some validity? She could look at it over Christmas and come back and deal with it in January, February or March. Why will she not do that? If the Democrats want to deal with the political disclosure part of the Bill, that is fine; let us do that today. We will deal with the disclosure part, providing, as Senator Parer says, it is fair and equitable and there is no intimidation. Let us deal with it today. Why does this other matter have to go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard for Senator Kernot to hear me because ever since the Senate started at 10 o'clock this morning Senator Bolkus has been sitting next to Senator Kernot and Senator Coulter&mdash;he has spent more time sitting there than he has spent sitting in his own seat&mdash;trying to intimidate them. As if that has not been good enough, we have also had the team of heavyweights. Senator Schacht has been doing the same thing.

I have put these figures to Senator Coulter and Senator Kernot, and I have asked them to come into this chamber and disprove them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is about disclosure; this Bill is about political advertising. Why can the Australian Democrats not officially disclose the benefit that they will be receiving under this Bill&mdash;a benefit which is unique to the Australian Democrats compared with any other political parties and interest groups, and particularly the smaller political parties? This is a unique benefit that Senator Kernot, Senator Coulter and their colleagues are about to give themselves. We want the Democrats and the Government to disclose this massive benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put figures before this Senate now for the third time&mdash;I have asked Senator Kernot to come out and refute them, and she has not been prepared to do it&mdash;to support the proposition that as a result of this Bill the Australian Democrats will receive a fourfold to fivefold increase in political advertising funding in the next election compared with the March 1990 election. It is a massive benefit. We have now been setting out the figures for the last 15 to 16 hours, and each time Senator Kernot has come into this chamber she has ducked the issue and avoided disclosing the Australian Democrats' own figures on the benefit that they will receive as a result of this Bill. They will be receiving, on my figures, a massive benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue to which I wish to speak in relation to this motion is this vexed question to which we are still awaiting a proper answer: why the rush? Senator Kernot says that she has had plenty of time to review the evidence, and I think that is a fair enough point&mdash;she has had plenty of time to review the evidence. She has been in constant consultation with Senator Bolkus on this matter and there is no argument that, as a result, she has been fully informed and fully briefed on the Government's Bill and its amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I ask Senator Kernot and Senator Coulter: has there been proper consultation with all those interest groups out there who will be affected by this Bill, who will not get the Democrats' $1.8m benefit? Have they had a chance to see the impact this Bill will have on them?  The answer, for those who are listening to the radio broadcast, is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are tuning in to this debate do not know what is involved in this Bill; they do not know of its impact on the interest groups and political parties that they are involved with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to rise to discuss this motion, but after the contribution from Senator Bell I feel I have to. The proposition that we in the coalition have put is that the Australian Democrats will get a windfall advertising bonus of $1.5m to $1.8m in a Federal election campaign. We have asked the Democrats to quantify that. We have asked them to tell us exactly what the windfall will be that they will get by virtue of this Bill&mdash;the free advertising that they would never have been able to afford before.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The material I have uncovered during the course of the book on the SEQEB dispute indicates that, while the SEQEB strike funds were collected for the sacked workers and their families, a great deal of the money that was collected simply did not reach the striking families. On many occasions, money was wasted. More significantly, on other occasions, it was decided that the money would be used for purposes not directly associated with the SEQEB dispute.</PARA>

<PARA>That sort of abuse, as Senator Schacht knows, is not legislated for in the Bill we have before us. The Labor Party has sunk so low that it grabs the funds specially donated by other unionists and specially donated by pensioners. There are many examples concerning money sent in by pensioners. That sort of abuse cannot be stopped when the Labor Party will sink so low as to steal the funds specially raised through advertisements and leaflets being handed around. Why the hypocrisy? Honourable senators opposite know that that abuse cannot be stopped. It is all a pretence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why the Bill should be divided&mdash;so that we can clearly look on the one hand at the disclosures and, on the other hand, at the ban on political broadcasting. They are two totally different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just talk about the ban on political broadcasting. Despite what Senator Bell said on air this morning, no amendments have yet been passed and, as the Bill presently stands, the ban lasts for the whole of the year. Senator Bell, on air this morning, absolutely misinterpreted the Bill we are presently debating. </PARA>

Labor democracy is no democracy at all. There is a secret ballot in the party room but, because the factions will not allow the system to work, after the secret ballot people are forced to show their vote to factional members to prove that they have voted the way their faction tells them. That is Labor democracy. We on this side of the chamber will have nothing to do with it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee ran out of time. The Senate sat at 10 o'clock on the Thursday and he had not finished giving evidence. But it was already clear to me that most of his evidence was absolutely irrelevant to the terms of reference. I agreed with Opposition senators that we immediately move a motion in the Senate that the Committee sit again at a later hour that day so that he could complete his evidence, even though as Chairman I had grave suspicions that any of his further evidence would not be within the terms of reference. Nevertheless, I supported that motion, as did the Government, when it would have been very easy not to grant leave. So we had an extra hour later that afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been accused by some Opposition senators of deliberately delaying the meeting between 5.00 p.m. and 6.00 p.m. by some 10 minutes, thus restricting Mr Sherry's time. I explained that I had been chairing the hearing of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, of which I am Chairman. The Committee had a special guest from South Africa who was speaking on constitutional change in that country. I think the Select Committee was about seven minutes late in starting. I ensured that all senators had approximately 10 minutes to ask their questions, which meant that I had less time than anybody else to ask my questions. I had only about two to three minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that annoyed me about Mr Sherry&mdash;and I have to be honest about this&mdash;was that it was quite clear that the only reason he wanted to come before the Committee was to get as much evidence, as he called it, on the record under privilege to name people in Queensland. I let him do that, but I thought it was only appropriate that at the end of his evidence I make a comment to him because he had said that he had never taken any of this evidence to the appropriate authorities&mdash;even though he was accusing people of clear criminal intent, intimidation, threats, fraud and so on.

That is the significance of this debate now. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The full disclosure of funding for political parties is highly desirable . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We say that is so. We support that and that is why we say these matters should be separated out. As to the other part of the legislation, the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest proposals from the Federal Labor Party to curtail political advertising during election campaigns deserve the fate of the previous proposals the ALP has put forward&mdash;they should be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have, even from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, a clear statement that one aspect of the legislation is favourable and the other should be totally opposed. To underline the big difference between the two segments in this legislation which should be separated, I want to dramatise to the Senate that the section of the legislation relating to the banning of political advertising provides for an additional area of corruption which the Government claims it is trying to get rid of. I can simply evidence that corruption here and now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That corruption involves the power to be given to the electronic media commentators, who will be permitted to run whatever they like on political matters in their programs, while the political parties are refused the right to use advertising to respond to or deny what this specially selected and honoured group of people is to be able to do under the extraordinary powers given by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the general question as to whether it is remarkable that advertisements in newspapers are good advertisements and are to be allowed but advertisements on radio, which are cheaper than newspaper advertisements, are somehow dishonourable and disgraceful and are not to be allowed&mdash;neither are television advertisements&mdash;the scope for corruption is self-evident. By way of evidence of not just the scope for corruption but of the existence of pressure from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) through a media proprietor in an election campaign, I refer to the situation in one of Brian Burke's Western Australian State election campaigns when McCann-Erickson Advertising Pty Ltd was briefed to handle Brian Burke's personal advertising campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Burke had seen footage from a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program that he wanted to use in a commercial on deregulation. He asked McCann-Erickson to get it from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> and to incorporate it in the commercial. McCann-Erickson initially tried to get it through the local channel in Perth&mdash;STW9 Perth. It in turn tried to get it from Channel 9 Sydney but to no avail. In fact, the request raised the ire of STW9's eastern States' counterpart because it did not want its material to be used in television advertising of a political nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When McCann-Erickson advised Burke that it was unable to obtain it and, of course, mentioned that to lift it from the program was illegal, Burke said that he would fix it up. Burke certainly went about fixing it up because McCann-Erickson then received a telephone call from the Prime Minister's office in which an officer asked what it was that McCann-Erickson wanted from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> and what it was to be used for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within 24 hours, McCann-Erickson in Perth received a telephone call from Gerald Stone&mdash;the executive producer of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> at that time&mdash;who, once reassured that neither he nor the program would be compromised and provided that there would be utmost confidentiality as to the source of the footage requested, advised that he would arrange for raw footage as opposed to a dub from the program to be sent to McCann-Erickson in Perth. It arrived the next day and was included in the advertisement in accordance with Brian Burke's instructions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention in passing that the production company for the series of commercials, Taimac, had Laurie Connell as a majority shareholder in the same little quaint circle of friends in Western Australia or, should we say, mates. To enable McCann-Erickson to produce the campaign without being seen to be involved with a political candidate or party, the commercials were produced for a phantom client called Turi Nominees. This was a front company owned by Mr Salvatore Salpietro, which was ultimately wound up at a cost to its creditors of something like $120,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs for the campaign, which had no budget, were paid from Brian Burke's office to McCann-Erickson from the now infamous advertising accounts Nos 1 and 2. No cheques were received, as I understand it, from Turi Nominees, the front company. Although Brian Burke's office administered the two advertising accounts, while waiting for funds to be donated to these vehicles, on occasions payment to McCann-Erickson was made from Labor Party funds administered by now Senator Michael Beahan who, quite understandably, wanted to know what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this point because here we have a situation where, because of mateship between the Prime Minister, the State Premier and the media proprietor, things can be done to help a political party like this. What would be the situation&mdash;assuming this legislation goes through&mdash;if there were no redress against the consequences of that mateship, where programs like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> with huge audiences could be so subject to mateship that, as in this case, they would make available something that should not be available to a Premier for his advertising campaign? If there were no advertising campaign, what other favours would be done to mates in this situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation gives added power to the deals to be done between mates in this situation, without giving political parties the opportunity to respond. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, when distinguishing between these two clearly separate pieces of legislation, says that the ALP is totally self-serving in proceeding with its political advertising element. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public interest has been invoked where, in fact, the only interest that has really concerned the ALP is its own precarious financial position and the fear that the Federal Opposition is in the position to run a devastating advertising campaign against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest proposals represent a compromise of a previous, cynical compromise.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats play a role in this. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats, who agreed to the current proposals, will now probably face pressure from the various interest groups the party claims to represent. The proposals suggest that the sharing of free television advertising time between the existing political parties be based on the proportion of the vote attracted at the last election. What will happen to interest groups representing, say, the Greens or the Aboriginal community? Would they be able to run advertisements during the campaign? Or would they be considered political groups?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the justifications for the proposals is the cost of advertising . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The article concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The option that apparently hasn't occurred to the ALP is to campaign within its means.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what this Bill is all about; it has nothing to do with the principle that the Labor Party has been going on about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address the question of why it is important to split the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991. The material I want to raise goes to the question as to whether one part of this Bill&mdash;that dealing with political advertising, the banning thereof and the allocation of so-called free time&mdash;is ultra vires the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three important points that need to be addressed in looking at the subject matter. First, is the time that is confiscated from the commercial television stations property? Secondly, if it is property, has there been an acquisition of it by either the Commonwealth or another party? Thirdly, if there has been such an acquisition of the property, has it been on just terms? Those reasons are pertinent because of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Section 51 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(xxxi) the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws.</PARA>
<PARA>That becomes the only relevant clause in the Constitution, and the only clause that can give power for this legislation, because of the case law. It is quite clear. First, I refer to the case of Clunies Ross v. the Commonwealth, reported at 155 CLR. In that case, the joint judgment of the six judges of the High Court declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plenary grant of legislative power contained in section 51(xxxi) has assumed the status of constitutional guarantee of just terms, as established in the Minister for the Army v. Dalziel (1944). It is to be given the liberal construction appropriate to such a constitutional provision.</PARA>
<PARA>The case cited is the Attorney-General v. Schmidt. The most up-to-date case, decided on only 29 October 1991, is the case of Peverill v. Health Insurance Commission, heard in the Federal Court of Australia by Burchett J., who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To construe a constitutional guarantee narrowly would be by that to diminish it and the Constitution. Repeatedly, and in various forms, this fundamental principle is laid down in the cases.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to cite cases where that has been determined. What he is saying is that section 51 (xxxi) is to be construed as a guarantee and that, further, it is to be construed in a liberal way. As we go through the case law we will see that `property' is to be widely interpreted, not simply in terms of whether it is an estate in fee simple or something of the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case law also establishes that one may not avoid the guarantee by using a circuitous method and using a statute which one believes could avoid that guarantee. Isaacs J., in a 1926 case, Commonwealth and Commonwealth Oil Refineries Ltd v. South Australia, states that, if a statute transgresses a constitutional prohibition either specifically or in a circuitous manner, then it will be struck down as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are three important things that we have established: first, that the Constitution implies a guarantee; secondly, that the word `property' is to be broadly construed, that is, liberally construed; and, thirdly, that one may not avoid the guarantee by using a circuitous method and using a statute which one believes could avoid that guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Isaacs J. said that the test to be applied to the impugned legislation is the substance of the operation of the statute rather than merely its form. But the pivotal case remains the Minister of State for the Army v. Dalziel, the 1944 case that I mentioned previously. In that case, Latham, the then Chief Justice, made the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision in the Constitution is plainly intended for the protection of the subject, and should be liberally interpreted.</PARA>
<PARA>Rich J. in the same case went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are concerned with is not a private document creating rights inter partes, but a Constitution containing a provision of a fundamental character designed to protect citizens from being deprived of their property by the Sovereign State except upon just terms.</PARA>
<PARA>The meaning of property in such a connection must be determined upon general principles of jurisprudence, not by the artificial refinements of any particular legal system or by reference to Sheppard's Touchstone. The language used is perfectly general. It says `the acquisition of property'; it is not restricted to acquisition by particular methods or of particular types of interest, nor to particular types of property. It extends to any acquisition of any interest in any property. It authorises such acquisition, but it expressly imposes two conditions on every such acquisition. It must be upon just terms and it must be for `a purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make the laws'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing here is that by any definition the property which is being acquired by the Commonwealth to be handed over to a third party, that is, in this case, the Democrats, the Labor Party, or indeed the Liberal Party for that matter, is property which has been seized, which has been acquired. The point that it has been acquired is borne out by the fact that it is passed over to somebody else to use and do something with. When one looks at whether or not there are just terms provided for this acquisition, one must answer no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To recap, so we understand, we have property which is being acquired&mdash;and, in the words of the Constitution and the case law interpretation, it may only be so acquired on just terms. If it fails that test, it is ultra vires the Constitution and it fails. In other words, the deal that has been put together by the Democrats with the Labor Party&mdash;that they, in return for whatever it is they have agreed to, get their talking heads commercials free to them but at the expense of somebody else in the run-up to the election&mdash;is ultra vires and not valid legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Look again at the case of Minister of State for the Army v. Dalziel. I have read the portion of Latham C.J. and Rich J. Mr Justice Burchett, in the case that I have mentioned, dated 29 October 1991, says quite clearly that he takes that case to mean:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . s. 51(xxxi) is not to be confined pedantically to the taking of title by the Commonwealth to some specific estate or interest in land recognized at law or in equity and to some specific form of property in a chattel or chose in action similarly recognized, but that it extends to innominate and anomalous interests and includes the assumption and indefinite continuance of exclusive possession and control for the purposes of the Commonwealth of any subject of property. Section 51 (xxxi) serves a double purpose. It provides the Commonwealth Parliament with a legislative power of acquiring property: at the same time as a condition upon the exercise of the power it provides the individual or the State, affected with a protection against governmental interferences with his proprietary rights without just recompense. In both aspects consistency with the principles upon which constitutional provisions are interpreted and applied demands that the paragraph should be given as full and flexible an operation as will cover the objects it was designed to effect. Moreover, when a constitution undertakes to forbid or restrain some legislative course, there can be no prohibition to which it is more proper to apply the principle embodied . . . In requiring just terms s. 51(xxxi) fetters the legislative power by forbidding laws with respect to acquisition on any terms that are not just. </PARA>
<PARA>In Trade Practices Commission v. Tooth and Co. Ltd, as reported in CLR 142 at page 403, Barwick, C.J., as he then was, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been decided, and in my respectful opinion quite correctly, that the presence of s. 51(xxxi) in the Constitution means that no other head of power, including the incidental power, would support a law for the acquisition of property.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this is the only head of power in the Constitution which allows the Commonwealth to acquire that property. The reason is plain. The constitutional purpose is to ensure that in no circumstance will a law of the Commonwealth provide for the acquisition of property except upon just terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 51 is a very great constitutional safeguard not confined to the protection of the citizen from the confiscation of his property by the state. It ensures that no-one may by virtue of a Commonwealth statutory provision acquire his property except on just terms. Again, Gibbs picks up the question of a circuitous device saying that it simply will not be permitted to circumvent that clause of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the need for an acquisition to take place, as distinct from merely depriving someone of something, there is again relevant case law in the Tasmanian dams case. In the interests of time, I recommend people to the judgments of Justices Mason, Brennan and Deane, wherein they state very clearly that there has to be an acquisition of the property. Indeed, the important words of Brennan J, were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where neither the Commonwealth nor any other person acquires property rights under a law of the Commonwealth, there is no acquisition upon which the paragraph may fasten.</PARA>
<PARA>But clearly in this case there is an acquisition of proprietary rights which are conferred upon third parties, as is encompassed in that statement of Brennan, J. The fact of the matter is that we have established that the time that is confiscated by the Government is property and there is an acquisition of it. We then come to the third point I raised at the beginning, and that is the question of whether it is acquired on just terms. Again, we can go to the case law, where it says that there is a simple definition of `just terms'. Mr Justice Starke in the Bank of New South Wales v. the Commonwealth said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "just terms" require that a party whose property is acquired shall have the pecuniary equivalent of the property acquired.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, this legislation does not provide for that. As I said at the beginning in speaking to the motion moved by Senator Parer, that the two of parts of the Bill should be separated and dealt with as two entirely separate pieces of legislation is not only reasonable but is logical, sensible and equitable. The Democrats have been placed in a position where they have had some legal advice and some advices made available to them&mdash;advices which I might say at this stage I have not seen but which I would be interested in looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area is one in which a prima facie case has been made out that this legislation could indeed be ultra vires the Constitution. As such, any reasonable man, or indeed any reasonable Minister, would consider that it is a logical and sensible course of action to now deal with the question of disclosure but to leave the question of whether this legislation either is or can be made valid so that proper investigation can be made. In fairness to the people with whom the Government has offered a deal&mdash;the Democrats&mdash;and in their own interests, it would be sensible for them to look at what sort of deal it is that they have struck. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 as it now stands with the Government amendments, and the proposals by the Opposition to correct what we believe is an outrageous attack on freedom of political expression in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill as it now stands with the Government amendments is such that during an election campaign all paid advertising on the electronic media&mdash;radio and television&mdash;will be banned. This applies to Federal, State and local government elections. It also means that at any time during the election period&mdash;which is defined from the close of nominations to the election date&mdash;no third party can pay for any advertisement on radio and television. We understand the position with regard to television, that it is a costly exercise; we are totally mystified as to why it should apply to radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding so-called free advertising, there is no such thing as free advertising because someone has to pay. In respect of television, the television stations have to pay. According to the calculations made by my colleague Senator Kemp, supported by Senator Kernot of the Democrats, during an election period the cost to the three television stations covering the Sydney area alone would be of the order of $5m. If one extrapolates that out to the rest of Australia one sees the amount of money involved. One sees the amount of about $1.8m that would accrue to the Australian Democrats on so-called free advertisements paid for by the commercial television stations that, financially, have been in diabolical trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition seeks to amend some of the Government's amendments. I will touch on the key amendments briefly; I will not go through the more minor ones. One of them is to remove the Territories and States from the coverage of this legislation on the basis that the role of this Parliament is to cover Federal elections. It is up to the States and the Territories to then make their own decisions as to what they want to do with regard to advertising during election campaigns. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talks a lot about federalism and cooperative federalism and this just shows how phoney his arguments are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also wishes to amend the Government's deal with the Australian Democrats to have so-called talking heads. It should be made clear to everyone that this legislation means that on television we can have visible to the public only the head and shoulders of the person who is speaking, and the ad must run for a minimum of two minutes. The aim, as has been said by many newspaper reporters, is to make it boring, boring, boring, so that people will not watch television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard Senator Coulter speak on this matter on a number of occasions and I think it is fascinating that the Australian Democrats introduced a talking heads proposal which they pinched from France. It is appropriate that it was the French who discovered the guillotine, and we have talking heads. Wonderful&mdash;a cartoonist's delight, I might say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is the trade-off and we have sought to amend that, not in any extravagant fashion but simply by allowing the presenter, the existing member of parliament or a future one, a Prime Minister or a Leader of the Opposition, to have at his or her disposal static captions, charts and things that make sense. Without that, as various newspaper reports have said, the concept is absolutely idiotic. It is like going on television to sell a motor car without showing the car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is in the business of selling a product; of telling people why its product is better than the Government's product. We are also in a position to criticise, quite correctly where it is needed, the Government's actions over the past three years, eight years or whatever it might be. This is an attempt, and a very transparent attempt, to bring about television advertising which will be paid for not by the political parties but by the television stations themselves. That is abominable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radio advertisements during election campaigns will be totally banned and the Opposition seeks to amend the Bill to allow a political party or third party to advertise on radio during election campaigns. After all, when we look at audience coverage, radio advertising is the cheapest form of media advertising. It is much cheaper than newspapers and it is much cheaper than magazines, yet it is the Government's penchant&mdash;supported by the Australian Democrats&mdash;to block out any sort of advertising on radio during election campaigns. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking very briefly to this and, I think, providing some rather substantive reasons as to why this should not happen, I would also like to direct some remarks through you, Mr Chairman, to Senator Sowada. I listened very carefully to most speeches last night and particularly to Senator Sowada's contribution. I certainly acknowledge that she did create a very attractive ivory tower and, like Rapunzel, sat at the top of it and supported the opposition to this legislation. However, I do not think Senator Sowada appreciates on what a dreadful foundation that ivory tower rests. The material which this Bill seeks to remove just in those final few weeks of campaigning, in 99 per cent of the cases involved, no matter who produced it, is garbage, is offensive and adds nothing. It might be clever marketing and advertising, but it does not add anything to democracy and free speech. </PARA>

The last election campaign in the Northern Territory&mdash;this would be of interest to all people interested in political analysis and certainly the academics&mdash;was the most extraordinary ever run in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal means that people unemployed for 12 months would be made to work for 80 per cent of the award rate. The title `Austrain' suggests that this is an on-the-job training program for the unemployed, but it is quite clear from the documentation that no training requirement resides with the employer. Therefore, it is not a training program; it is a cheap labour scheme and, because it abolishes Jobstart, it removes any possibility of there being a training operation. This is a straight out cheap labour scheme which forces people to work for exploitation level wages. My colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training called it `Austslave' rather than `Austrain', and he is dead right about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme distorts the labour market in two ways.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a copy of Dr Hewson's speech. It was the Sir Richard Kirby memorial lecture at Wollongong University. It is a frightening irony that a speech such as this should be given in the name of such a distinguished former president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as Sir Richard. If one looks at the speech, one can see that Dr Hewson, a former professor of economics, does not understand, or does not appear to understand, the basic and fundamental concept of a minimum rates award.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minimum rates awards, of course, almost universally come from the Industrial Relations Commission. They are awards based on what the industry sector can afford to pay. They are couched so that the weakest employer in that industry sector can afford to pay those rates. They are, in effect, a true minimum. Employers can and do make over-award payments; where there are unionised workplaces there is often a formalised agreement. In non-union shops, over-award payments are often made by agreement between the individual worker and the employer. The concept of a minimum rates award is fundamental and basic to industrial relations in this country. What did Dr Hewson say about it?  He said that differences in wages between individuals in the same company did not occur, differences between companies in the same industries did not occur, and differences between industries did not exist. He went on to say that firms in Broome, Geelong, Sydney, Melbourne or Townsville would have to pay a uniform amount regardless of their particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, Dr Hewson does not understand the concept of minimum rates awards and how employers, who have a financially stronger position and have greater productivity than the minimum employer performance in their industry sector or who are more profitable, in fact pay above the awards. As well, Dr Hewson is not speaking the truth when he says that there is uniformity in award rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from a survey conducted in the metal trades industry in March 1989. It is a survey on the dispersion of incomes for process workers across the metal trades area. Across the metal trades industries in Australia, the weekly wage for process workers varied between $270 and $514 per week. So much for the uniformity between Broome and Geelong. The survey found that the weekly wage for a fitter varied between $344 and $711 a week. It has to be said that that is the finding of an objective survey. All of those occupations in this industry sector are covered by the same metal trades minimum rates award. There are clearly differences between individuals; there are clearly differences between companies; and the metal trades industry differs from other industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Opposition members have said, and one of the reasons why the Government will not follow this course, is that industrial relations is the key area of difference between us and them and the key issue in the so-called `Frightpack' that they have produced. In that document of over 500 pages there are only one and a bit pages devoted to industrial relations, so we remain somewhat in the dark about it. What we do know is that Dr Hewson is wrong on some very fundamental points.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware of the recent statement by Professor Roland Simbulan, an aide to Philippines Senator Tanada, that the Philippines Navy uses patrol boats as part of its counterinsurgency operations, particularly in the Visayas and in Mindanao?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Approval in principle to export patrol boats to the Philippines was given in January 1990 and commercial negotiations have been under way since then to seal that contract. An application for an export permit will need to be submitted and a permit granted before the vessels can be exported from Australia. I understand that the value of the contract is about $215m. Of course, I am not responsible for the commercial arrangements made between the Australian Submarine Corporation and the Philippines Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce announced in a press release on 19 November that the Government would approve a loan of $145m to the Philippines Navy. The loan will be provided through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The basis of the decision was the benefit to Australian industry and it was subject to the condition that the loan would be used by the Philippines to build patrol boats at the Carrington shipyards and not on any preconditions imposed by the Philippines Government. I understand that the professor to whom Senator Vallentine referred has made a recent statement, but I am not fully apprised of the content of that statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vessels are designed for use in coastal protection, anti-smuggling and national police duties in estuarine and coastal areas.

I suggest that they are out-of-date and not as strict as the Minister, by his own admission, would like.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware that the 1989 guidelines were handed out. I understand the revised ones, as discussed between Senator Evans and myself and announced in a couple of statements, are to be printed fairly soon. I think in that context that we would have circulated the 1989 guidelines just as a broad and general guide with some warning that amendments have been made. It might be a good way to get rid of the back stocks.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say to those who picked up the 1989 guidelines that they should apprise themselves of the various statements made by Senator Evans and me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree, but I bet the Opposition does not agree with those propositions. I recognise in the question of Senator Giles words used in a speech given by Premier Nick Greiner in Tokyo just the other day. I am interested to see the reaction of the Opposition in rejecting the propositions that Premier Nick Greiner put forward. This is perhaps a split in the Liberal Party ranks. I am also pleased to see that even if it means he has to leave Australia to do it, Nick Greiner is prepared to say some true things about industrial relations perceptions in Australia. He is to be commended for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition always tries to distort the record of industrial relations in this country, but what Nick Greiner has said is accurate in many respects. He said that `when it comes to wages, strikes, inflation and economic growth figures Australia suffers from miscast perceptions and unfair stereotyping'. He is referring of course to that period of the Hawke Government during which we have had moderate wage outcomes and a dramatic drop in strike levels and to the fact that we are now below the OECD countries in inflation levels. However, to some extent there is an unfair stereotyping and perception that those things have not been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Greiner has said that strikes have declined by 70 per cent. Certainly it is true that the numbers of strikes have declined. If one compares the Fraser years with the Hawke years, it is ours over the Liberals by 61 per cent. I am not quite sure how Mr Greiner calculates 70 per cent. He may be choosing the high point of massive confrontation during the Fraser years and then declining from that level, picking up the reduction in strikes during the 1982-83 recession that the Opposition caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that cooperation has overtaken confrontation in the Australian workplace and that we have engaged in award restructuring and workplace reform. Of course, the accord has been a fundamental tool in bringing Australians together in the field of industrial relations to work cooperatively and not in conflict, as has been the case in the past. It is also true that inflation is at a 20-year low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also say that Australia would do better on all of these indicators if New South Wales lifted its game. It is true that the Greiner Government has dragged up the figures on strike levels when the rest of Australia has shown that it can perform better than New South Wales. To August 1991, the rate of industrial disputes in New South Wales was 50.7 per cent higher than the Australian average. If those opposite want to say that New South Wales is a manufacturing State, I point out that industrial disputes in Victoria were 23.9 per cent lower than the national average. In comparing Victoria and New South Wales, I emphasise that while Victoria was 23.9 per cent lower than the national average, New South Wales was 50.7 per cent higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Greiner could help our national profile and overseas markets if he did something about his own backyard. When one looks at Mr Greiner's own backyard, one sees that in the New South Wales Government sector, in the rail area and the hospital and medical sectors, there have been disputes because the Government has mismanaged its public sector policy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a massive dispute in New South Wales only recently when the Government brought in confrontationist industrial legislation. Perhaps I can offer some advice to Mr Greiner. He should get off the New Zealand road; he should copy the legislation that we have to improve industrial relations; and he should start trying to bring Australians together to work together in the workplace, rather than confronting them and involving himself in industrial conflict.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been keen almost from the outset to explore a role for the United Nations in response to the terrible events of 12 November. That has been made clear in a number of public statements made by me and the Prime Minister and in communications that have taken place between me and the Indonesian Ambassador here and also in Jakarta. Moreover, this is an issue that I will certainly be exploring and taking further during the course of my discussions in Indonesia in a couple of weeks time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially our view was that the most productive avenue for such a UN involvement might be for the head of the UN Centre for Human Rights, Mr Martenson, to visit Jakarta for discussions with the Indonesian authorities in the context of a seminar on human rights that was proposed to be held in Indonesia this month. That meeting has, for a variety of reasons, now been deferred, notwithstanding our representations and those of a number of others. We now understand that the United Nations Secretary-General has decided to send the UN Commission on Human Rights special rapporteur on summary or arbitrary executions, Mr Amos Wako, to visit Indonesia in pursuit of his mandate to investigate incidents of this kind. That is an existing mandate which is vested in him by the UN Commission on Human Rights, of which Indonesia is currently a member, and certainly that mandate, in our judgment, would extend to scrutiny of the events that occurred on 12 November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The special rapporteur has not yet arrived in Jakarta. Although the Indonesian Government has been informed of the Secretary-General's decision, it does appear at this stage&mdash;at least as I was advised this morning&mdash;that it has not yet agreed to a specific role for the special rapporteur. Accordingly, a few hours ago I instructed the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to convey to the Indonesian authorities our view that they should receive and fully cooperate with the special rapporteur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly our hope that the involvement of the special rapporteur, and perhaps UN involvement in other ways still to be explored, would enhance the international acceptability of the processes of investigation into the events of and the events surrounding 12 November.

Can the Minister guarantee that people with disabilities will not be worse off, either in terms of program access or quality of training, as a result of the omission of group focused services for people with disabilities for the 1992 Skillshare guidelines? Why has the Government chosen to ignore its own draft Skillshare disability strategy paper which advocates the provision of additional modular funding from 1992 onwards for Skillshare projects that meet set targets in terms of clients with disabilities? Does the fact that DEET continues to distribute this draft strategy paper, although its contents are not reflected in the 1992 Skillshare guidelines, indicate that the Government should get its own house in order instead of making spurious claims about the coalition's policy in relation to people with disabilities?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that I can answer all of Senator Patterson's question, but I do have some information which I think goes a long way towards doing that. I am informed that the Skillshare program guidelines for 1992 extend the capacity of the Skillshare network to provide an increased rate and quality of services to people with disabilities. There has in fact been a conscious effort to involve all 367 Skillshare projects in the Government's policy commitment to people with disabilities, rather than simply having a handful of projects specialising in services to people with those disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect it is worth noting that the Government introduced funding in 1991 for 10 disability access and support units whose role is to assist Skillshare projects to increase the range and quality of their training provision for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further informed that, while recognising the good work done over the years through specialist projects, unfortunately it is the view of the Minister that this has had the effect of marginalising the provision of employment services and skills training to a comparatively small number of people with disabilities. Specifically, the problem has been that the new program guidelines have clarified the responsibility of generic Skillshare projects and the roles and functions of disability access support units have clearly indicated that additional outreach funding is available to the Skillshare projects to assist people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's view is that the current approach provides the greatest range of training opportunities to people with disabilities with the least possible dislocation of home life and social contact. It also provides the opportunity for a person with a disability to undertake training which will be related to employment opportunities in the area in which he or she lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy is one of service provision and is consistent with the Government's overall social justice strategy and the principles and objectives as embodied in the Disability Services Act 1986. I am further informed that this extension of service provision to people with disabilities through all generic Skillshare projects represents a significant contribution to the disability reform package which was implemented on 12 November 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area the Government is driven by a recognition that currently people with disabilities represent 13.6 per cent of unemployed people awaiting placement. That is of concern to us. The percentage of people with disabilities being serviced by Skillshare projects this financial year has already increased for this period. We envisage through this strategy that the Skillshare network will achieve a 13.6 per cent participation rate by the end of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister further advises of his concern that ACROD and Disabled Peoples International feel that they were excluded from the development of the Skillshare disability strategy for the provision of services. Further, it is the Minister's understanding that the consultants engaged to develop the strategy liaised with ACROD and DPI. He says, in conclusion, that it is always the case that when strategies for public policies are developed in consultation with a number of interest groups, there will be conflicting views expressed and not all ideas will be able to be included in the final document.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button has not listened to many commentators if he thinks that. During Question Time, in response to a question from Senator Maguire, Senator Button ranged very widely over a series of statistics, from interest rates to foreign debt to living standards and the like. Most of those so-called facts that he gave in his answer were either wrong or, at the very best, misleading, and I wish to address my remarks to two or three of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I address interest rates. In that context, Senator Button referred to the Syntec report which was released yesterday and reported in today's press. It claims that under the coalition's Fightback proposals, in the short term, interest rates would rise very steeply before falling very considerably later in the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the Syntec allegation is concerned, Syntec has made much the same mistake as that made by the Government in its analysis of the package. The Syntec forecasters have predicted an after-GST increase in the CPI for 1994 of 9.5 per cent under the coalition's proposals. On that basis, they forecast that nominal interest rates would rise to 13 per cent during the next term of government, which will be the first term of a coalition government. Presumably, Syntec made that forecast by adding an assessment of the real interest rate to apply in that year to the inflation rate. That simplistic rule of thumb may work in some situations, but why would nominal interest rates rise because of the GST when the GST has only a one-off impact on inflation, and when that one-off increase will be fully accommodated by monetary policy settings and by income tax reductions&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just let me finish. Senator Walsh can have his go. From reading his column yesterday, he does not even understand how the GST works. The one-off increase in inflation will be fully accommodated by monetary policy settings and by income tax reductions which preserve the after-tax rate of return to investors, with reduced income taxes of course more than compensating for the one-off price increases. That has been made clear in the coalition's proposals from day one. The fact that the coalition will compensate low to middle income earners for the introduction of the GST through the tax and expenditure systems is precisely the approach that was going to be taken in 1985 by the Government, but that option, option C, was aborted when Bill Kelty said that he would not have it. So Syntec seems to have overlooked that quite fundamental and simple point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other things that one can say and should say about the Syntec report. We have acknowledged that our policies will lead to a one-off inflation increase. The Syntec analysis seems to assume that that increase will be ongoing and will feed on into interest rates. But there are two main reasons why that analysis is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the coalition's industrial relations policy will reduce the power of trade union leadership by removing the legal monopoly of the trade unions. What union claiming to represent the interests of its constituency would argue for unnecessary wage increases at a time of high unemployment? Secondly, given the lower marginal rates of taxation, not to mention our savings tax incentive scheme, there is no reason at all for the after-tax return on savings to fall, even with a one-off inflation increase. Thus any additional potential upward pressure on interest rates from that source is ameliorated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, in a recent article by Peter Stemp, the Murphy model was used to model the inflation effects of an indirect/direct tax mix switch. It was concluded that, provided there is a consensus that there will be no flow-on wage increases in addition to the tax expenditure measures, there would be no ongoing inflationary boost. Therefore, from our point of view, that conclusion could be interpreted as follows: when we are elected on the merits of our package there will be community consensus that the tax expenditure measures outlined do compensate low to middle income earners and that that compensation is fully adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be given a mandate to introduce our industrial relations policy which will reduce the power of the trade unions. Thus we will be able to ensure that that inflationary impact is one-off. If there is any suggestion that our approach to this will be any different from the Government's, let me remind the Senate of the views in 1985 of the former Treasurer, Mr Keating, who was at that time the most ardent advocate of the introduction of the GST. He was asked about the impact on inflation of the option C proposal that he was putting forward. On 12 June 1985 he addressed a dinner of the Australian Finance Conference and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some contributors to the taxation debate have expressed concern that the Government's preferred approach could have adverse effects on both inflation and the level of economic activity. . . As the minister most directly responsible for the Government's campaign against inflation and unemployment, let me say that if I believed the proposed switch to a consumption tax would have such dire consequences, I would not have a bar of it.</PARA>
<PARA>Paul Keating went on to say that once the trade union movement agreed to discounting&mdash;and there is no earthly reason why the</PARA>
<PARA>trade union movement would not agree to discounting this time around, given the compensation and the tax cuts that are proposed to accompany the GST:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The one-off effect on price levels quickly washes out of the system.</PARA>
<PARA>He was saying that in the context of a set of proposals which the Government itself admitted would lift the CPI by 6 1/2 per cent. We are talking about a set of proposals which would lift the CPI by 4.4 per cent, would lift the non-farm GDP deflator by only 2.2 per cent and, for virtually every Australian, would mean much fuller compensation for the one-off price impact of that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button cannot get away with misleading the Senate in the way he does every day at Question Time, when he either totally refuses to answer questions or wheels in facts that are just plain wrong. The last matter I want to mention&mdash;and I know Senator Bishop and perhaps other honourable senators will mention other matters&mdash;is Senator Button's reference today to Australia's international competitiveness, as judged by our capacity to service our foreign debt. What Senator Button did today was typical of him: he told only half the story. The figures he related today were only for Australia's foreign debt. Australia's obligations to the rest of the world are not only debt but also equity investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we include equity investment and, therefore, our total net foreign liabilities&mdash;not just our debt but debt plus equity, and we must cover the two&mdash;that tells a very different story. There has been a continually progressive increase in our net foreign liabilities. That figure was $183.3 billion for the September quarter; just one year ago it was $170.1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So over the last 12 months to the September quarter there has been an increase of $12 billion, or roughly 8 per cent. The annual cost of servicing those foreign liabilities is running at more than $17 billion, as we have said on numerous occasions in recent days. That figure equals 28.5 per cent of our exports of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Button has given us today a misleading impression of our international competitive position. He was really just aping what the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, said in his speech in Sydney yesterday when he used much lower figures, and it is a very cruel distortion, an absolutely misleading interpretation of the figures. He is trying to disguise the very serious, fundamentally deep-seated problems that this economy faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the indictment that has to be made of Mr Kerin as Treasurer is that in recent days, and particularly with what will turn out to be an infamous speech in Sydney yesterday, he has been trying to delude the Australian people into thinking that we do not have serious problems in the Australian economy. Unless we wake up to the seriousness of this situation, unless we adopt the sorts of radical changes and proposals that have been put forward by Dr Hewson and the coalition in the Fightback proposals, we will never ever make a start on stabilising, let alone turning around and correcting, those conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we will continue to condemn more than a million and a half Australians, many of them young people, to a continuing life of unemployment and underemployment. The Government might want to pursue that path, but I can tell Senator Button, the Senate, the Government and the Australian people that that is certainly not the course that the coalition proposes to follow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short assured us that the 5 per cent, or whatever the figure finally turns out to be, boost to inflation, which according to the Syntec assessment will take the inflation rate close to 10 per cent again, will be a one-off boost to inflation because `other policy settings' will ensure a return to present outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so doing, he confirmed that the Opposition plans a credit squeeze. What other policy settings can ensure that that is a one-off only?  There are two: it can tighten fiscal policy or it can tighten monetary policy. The Opposition has already committed itself not to tighten fiscal policy. The Opposition says that all the benefits of the expenditure cuts which it plans but has not specified, all the extra revenue which its value added tax will raise, will be totally refunded to other taxpayers in the form of personal income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has closed the door on tightening fiscal policy three years ahead of time. So there is only one thing left for the Opposition: another credit squeeze&mdash;a repetition of New Zealand. New Zealand had a one-off boost in inflation. How did it achieve that?  By pushing unemployment up by 5 percentage points. Clearly, that is what the Opposition plans to do. It has closed off the fiscal policy and there is only one policy setting left: another credit squeeze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's fall back argument, of course, is that it will emasculate the trade unions&mdash;a la Thatcher, who emasculated the trade unions in the United Kingdom and pushed both unemployment and inflation up to 13 per cent. That even beat John Howard's 1982-83 record. In the UK, Thatcher, after emasculating the trade unions, managed to put both unemployment and inflation up to 13 per cent. Either the Opposition is lying when it gives people the assurance that all the benefits of its expenditure cuts and the extra revenue its value added tax raises will be entirely passed on in the form of lower personal income tax or it is planning to control the inflationary consequences of its value added tax with a credit squeeze and a 4 or 5 per cent increase in unemployment.

I think we have to put it straight: the purpose of my speaking yesterday was to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> from the Fightback package the top paragraph on page 345, and that is exactly what is reproduced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes back to page 342, which is where Senator Button yesterday began his little tirade, one will see that there are three figures shown there with relation to the foreign debt: the base case, the low road and the high road&mdash;the high road, of course, being the coalition's preferred option and part of our package, the other two cases representing what would happen if we in fact do not win government and put our policy into operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the most important thing I wanted to draw to the Senate's attention yesterday&mdash;and I think I had better do it again today so that people, particularly Senator Button, can understand&mdash;was that Senator Button did have trouble yesterday reading the Fightback package. I understood that, because he has great difficulty in even listening to his own Department. Yesterday I drew attention to the fact that his own departmental deputy secretary, Dr Bell, had given a perfectly splendid speech in July of this year when he said, and I think this is perhaps one of the better passages:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the lack of an internationally `competitive' tax regime&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which we have in this country under this Government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Jones this day relating to employment.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that the Government is finding itself in an increasingly impossible position in trying to attack the coalition's Fightback program. No doubt that is one of the reasons why people such as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Gerry Hand, and Bob Carr have thrown in the towel. They have conceded that they are simply not making progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could not have had a better example of the Government's inept response than the answer given by Senator Cook today on a question relating to Austrain. Austrain is a program that has been put forward in our Fightback program as a deliberate means of providing on the job training via training wages for those who have been out of the work force for considerable periods. Those people who have been unemployed for six months or more will be able to work for 90 per cent of the award minimum wage, but the payment will need to be brought up to the full award minimum within 12 months. If they have been out of the work force for 12 months or more, they will be able to be employed for 80 per cent of the award wage, but it will need to be brought up to the minimum award figure within 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that this is a perfectly unexceptionable proposition and, indeed, it is one that commends itself to a large number of employers. Those who have been interviewed in the media as prospective participants have made it clear that they regard this as a very attractive way of getting a foot in the door, getting into the real work force, and not simply being kept amused on the sidelines by some of these mickey mouse training programs that are currently on offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did Senator Cook do in response to this proposal? First, he said that people will be made to work. I would have thought that one could be sufficiently charitable to assume that Senator Cook has actually read our document. If he had and had looked at page 255, he would have read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those who have received social security benefits for a minimum of six months, special provisions will be introduced to allow the long term unemployed to accept special `on-the-job' training wage rates . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that it is a voluntary, not a compulsory, program. That is the first major misstatement on the part of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, he argues that this is somehow a distortion of the wages market and that it will lead to unscrupulous employers simply sacking people, the so-called churning argument. Again, even Senator Cook, who prides himself&mdash;precious though he might be&mdash;on being in touch with what is in documentation relating to work force practices, should also have read page 255, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special safeguards will apply to ensure that full-wage employees are not merely replaced by those persons eligible for AUSTRAIN.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Local Employment Boards will co-ordinate, approve and monitor the placement of AUSTRAIN trainees.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it will simply not be possible for people to be displaced, to be thrown out of a job position and replaced by someone else who might be in the Austrain market and, as a result, unfairly discriminate against those who are performing satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly plain from reading the document that that is precisely the role of local employment boards: to ensure that there is no exploitation and to monitor and approve&mdash;if necessary, disapprove&mdash;of employers who seek to exploit workers who might be in that position. It is sheer hypocrisy for Senator Cook to come in here and to be asked a question that enables him to run such a dishonest campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by demonstrating the disgraceful nature of this answer by referring to a couple of the Government's current training programs: one is Jobstart, which is a wage subsidy program in which the Government makes up the difference, so in principle a discount is still being paid; the other is Jobskills, which is a new initiative announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the March economic statement, which commenced from 1 July 1991. Only some weeks ago Senator Cook told the Senate that the basic award wage in this country was around $300 a week. I think he even referred to child-care workers as being on the bottom of the pile. There was no suggestion on his part that a person could get a job for less than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of Jobskills is, in fact, to engage people for less than the minimum award wage. Participants will be paid a training wage of $280 a week during their involvement with Jobskills. One would have thought that we are simply offering another form of training wage with the great virtue that it does not involve any cost to government. Indeed, it is a subsidy borne in the short term by the employee, who is delighted to be given that opportunity. Who should have endorsed Jobskills? No less than the ACTU.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make a personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented. There was an article on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> this morning suggesting that the Opposition was proposing to introduce a new tax on employers as a means of implementing its low-wage assistance scheme for the jobless; in other words, Austrain. It is probably of some significance that Senator Cook did not refer to this article. The article talks about the mooted tax being a convoluted device. In a number of areas the article continues to talk in terms of a tax device and it quotes a spokesman commenting on my behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that at no stage have I or the Opposition proposed any such tax. The concept of a tax is that it is something that raises revenue. Austrain, by its very nature, is not designed to raise revenue; indeed, it is designed to save revenue. We have already committed ourselves to abolishing seven taxes. The Government has followed suit with the coal levy, and presumably it will be doing its best to continue to follow suit in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I have suggested in public is that we want to introduce new taxes. Indeed, Austrain goes in the opposite direction. Therefore, I simply want to make it clear that what is contained in that article is mere speculation about one possible alternative to initiatives that might involve the direct regulation of wages. But certainly the implementation of the Austrain program would not involve any new tax and would not, by definition, involve any new revenue raising. Indeed, quite the opposite: it will assist the Government and in particular the Minister for Finance by avoiding the need to provide social welfare benefits and other government transfer payments by having the burden borne in the private sector. I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. </PARA>

<PARA>The National Capital Planning Authority came into existence when the ACT obtained self-government on 11 May 1988.

It is important that both the ACT Planning Authority and the National Capital Planning Authority work together so that those who wish to invest in Canberra and develop things here are able to find out what the rules and regulations are with a minimum of disruption.

<PARA>I will return to the Auditor-General's findings in respect of Abstudy in a minute because they are very serious. The findings relating to the assistance for isolated children do merit attention as well. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key findings of that audit were that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">mechanisms for program delivery needed to be simplified</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.there had been no comprehensive evaluation of the scheme in recent years, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.there was a need for more rigorous adherence to departmental guidelines for establishing eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to protective security the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key findings were that the Department lacked a comprehensive national protective security policy and that it needed to:</PARA>

<PARA>it is rather curious that they do not seem to know what requires attention&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.initiate an appropriate training program to ensure staff are aware of their responsibilities and obligations relating to protective security.</PARA>
<PARA>I now return to the question of Abstudy. There really are some problems in this area which the Government must do something about. The Auditor-General pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accepted Commonwealth definition of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives, or has lived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was noted, as in previous audits, that there was no verification check carried out, before payment, to determine whether an applicant satisfied this definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has previously maintained that various arrangements exist which act as safeguards. These include:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the 1989 Abstudy Policy Manual states that the declaration on the application form provides sufficient basis on which to assess a student as an Aboriginal, unless a doubt is raised in writing by a reliable source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO acknowledged the administrative burden that a 100% verification check of Aboriginality would entail, but believes some use of verification checks is required.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enrolment and attendance checks are a key control in ensuring eligibility for benefits under the Abstudy program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Departmental Abstudy Policy Manual provides for checks to be undertaken of students' enrolment, continuing attendance, and progress in their approved course. The ANAO could find no evidence that these checks were being undertaken. These checks are important for the Department to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.ensure assistance was provided only to those students who had continuing eligibility throughout the academic year</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.monitor adequately the degree to which the program objectives were being achieved, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.make adjustments to amounts payable as required for low attendance levels.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter was taken up quite some time ago&mdash;back in 1988&mdash;by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which expressed its concern:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Department is placing undue emphasis on such post-payment checks, and that insufficient attention may have been paid to tightening departmental procedures in all areas of program administration. The Committee understands that departmental records indicate that one in every five students under ABSEC may have received overpayments, and about one in six students under Abstudy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office recommended that some sort of check be undertaken. It is extraordinary, given the kinds of problems that have been raised in the past, that apparently nothing much had been done about it. I go on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit revealed that the use of the DSS clearance forms had been less than satisfactory. Many instances were noted where an applicant had stated that he/she was in receipt of a pension/benefit from DSS but that the Department did not advise DSS via the clearance form. The ANAO was advised that no clearance forms were to be forwarded to DSS, and that the onus would be on the applicant to advise DSS that they were in receipt of Abstudy payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office is concerned that there has been a move to place the onus on Abstudy recipients to inform DSS that they are in receipt of Abstudy benefits. The ANAO considers that departments have a responsibility to put controls in place to ensure, as far as possible, that beneficiaries do not receive benefits to which they may not be entitled. The Department's present approach does not appear to meet its responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>These are very important matters. There is $83m involved in this project. It would seem to me that the Department's reluctance to proceed adequately to fix up these sorts of problems which have been recognised for some time is not satisfactory. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO found that, in addition to receipt of a pension/benefit from DSS, it was possible for an applicant to be eligible for income from other departments or government bodies such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). It was noted that there was no liaison between the Department and these funding bodies to confirm receipt of income or benefits, and to provide the Department with some assurance that payments were being made only to applicants who were entitled.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a sorry story. I will not detail any more of it. At this stage, because of the pressure on time, I defer to my parliamentary colleague. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion which Senator Baume has moved, I wish to raise one very small but extremely important aspect of the Auditor-General's Report No. 14 and the issue of assistance for isolated children contained therein. The report refers on page 33 to requirements on parents to provide verification of dependent children by way of birth certificates, although the Department of Employment, Education and Training has indicated that its view is that misrepresentation of the number of dependent children in a family is a low risk area. I wonder whether putting isolated parents and families to the expense of getting birth certificates and so on is appropriate. In the last paragraph of the document there is an indication of some possibility of data matching. But, of course, that also runs into problems with privacy that we have run into in other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1990, I raised in this Parliament the case of a person living in Port Arthur in Tasmania who appealed against the removal of family allowance when her child reached the age of 16 because she was receiving a boarding allowance for a student child under the assistance for isolated children scheme. I referred that case to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, and asked him whether he had noted that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal had said that, because of the technical interpretation of the then section 81 of the Social Security Act, the appellant's appeal could not be upheld but that her case was&mdash;and I am quoting the Appeals Tribunal&mdash;`a reasonable case', and that it seemed unreasonable that receipt of AIC `should disqualify receipt of family allowance'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seem to recall that I moved an amendment at that stage, in May 1990, to give effect, as it were, to the views of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The Minister indicated to me, and to the whole of the Senate on that occasion, that he, too, regarded the case as reasonable and regarded my amendment to be also reasonable. But he appealed to the Senate and to me not to proceed because the matter would need to be looked at further by the Government. Indeed, subsequently, the Government brought down amending legislation which remedied the problem which had been raised in the first place by my constituent in Port Arthur. The Minister stated clearly that he thought that that person also had a very good case for back payment of family allowance. To give the Minister his due, he had written to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance, on 14 August 1991, replied with a letter which, in short, overrode the information given to me by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson&mdash;on which basis I had withdrawn my amndment. That amendment would have been supported there and then because there was support for it from all around the chamber, from the Opposition and the Democrats. But I withdrew it on the basis of that indication from Senator Richardson. I was sure that, given his position in the Cabinet, a payment would be made to this constituent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important matter and I hope that the Minister for Social Security will continue his efforts in this regard. I refer to a letter that I wrote to him on 7 October 1991 requesting that this be done. I raise this issue now under this heading, and I will continue to raise it in the hope that the Minister will be successful in obtaining approval for payment to this constituent who is entitled, in my view and I think in the Minister's view, to some recognition of the fact that it was her case that pointed out the problem which was subsequently rectified.

This legislation brings the ABC under the umbrella of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The ABC would prefer to cooperate with the concept of roadblocking but, instead of having the ABC under the umbrella of the Tribunal along with the commercial television networks and the Special Broadcasting Service, it would prefer us to create three separate entities&mdash;the Tribunal, the Corporation and the Service.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was felt to be totally inappropriate to have three separate arbiters, maybe tossing three separate coins. It was totally impractical for the ABC to be left out of that. The ABC&mdash;and I believe I am representing its concern for its integrity&mdash;is very happy to accept being a part of the Tribunal's final arbitration system on the matter of the last 10 per cent for minority parties.

If we do go into a longer debate, I will go into the reasons more extensively.

In many ways, I find the way the Government deals with radio to be the most astonishing part of this process that it is attempting to implement in law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem I have is that, if one accepts the argument, which I understand is promoted by some, that in some ways television advertising can be unreasonably emotive and unreasonably convincing and that is why one has to apply a special regime for television, then I do not think anyone argues that those same principles apply to radio. I have not heard anyone say that radio advertising in some ways is unfairly persuasive. If it is not unfairly persuasive, why are we concerned to prohibit advertising on radio?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only argument to that would be that it is too expensive. But, as I understand it, radio advertising is actually quite moderately priced. It is certainly very moderately priced in relation to TV. There have been times in my life when I have been responsible for booking blocks of radio advertisements and, compared with booking blocks of TV advertisements, it costs almost nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is it moderately priced in relation to television, but also it is not particularly expensive in relation to print media which is allowed, of course, by this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument does not seem to be that it is unfairly emotive. So I cannot understand the argument to treat radio this way. That is why Senator Parer has moved this amendment. Our starting point is that the whole Bill is a fundamental breach of freedom of speech, but it seems to us particularly illogical in the way it deals with radio. We believe that the community should be entitled to take out radio advertisements and to pay for them during a period of elections. Therefore, we have moved to delete these provisions so that that fundamental right that has existed for Australians in the past will be able to continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine, who was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters with me in a previous Parliament, must remember the evidence given by the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters. FARB made a couple of very interesting points. In principle it argued against any ban but, if there was to be a ban, it was absolutely opposed to free time on radio even more than television because of the very diverse nature of commercial radio and the awkwardness of fitting in with program arrangements. Once the Federation got past its objections to the principle of the ban as far as the workings of providing free time were concerned, from my recollection of the evidence it was totally opposed to free time. I think that is part of the response of the Government here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to point out that with radio we are dealing, as I say, with a much more diverse system of programs. Radio stations have specialised programming. We also have to deal with the major markets, and there are a couple of dozen commercial radio stations in the greater metropolitan Sydney or Melbourne markets. It is not as cheap as some people think for radio spot ads in the major markets. If we went to a top radio station in Sydney or Melbourne to place a 30-second advertisement, we would be paying $500, $600 or $700 each time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief remarks on the contributions made by Senator Schacht and Senator Harradine. The Schacht report itself recognised that radio did play an important role. Senator Schacht and I may differ on the issue of free time and paid time in radio, but all the evidence before the Committee fully endorsed, I believe, the comments Senator Schacht made to the chamber that radio was a very important means of communication, particularly in election periods. Radio is important for people to be able to get messages across not only to the groups he mentioned but particularly to rural communities as well, which were excluded from the comments by Senator Schacht. I have to say that incomprehensibly and with no explanation the recommendation in the Schacht report to include radio was dropped out of the Bill. I am not sure why that was the case. Senator Schacht has not explained it to us; nor has the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate will not end today&mdash;it will, of course, go on in the weeks and months to come&mdash;so I would like to ask Senator Coulter or Senator Kernot to put on record just why they are proposing to exclude radio.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I would like to make in relation to Senator Schacht's comments is that all the evidence before the Committee actually showed that of the four or five major forms of election campaigning&mdash;direct mail, TV advertising, radio advertising, telemarketing and so forth&mdash;the cheapest form was radio. If one wants to get a message to the widest number of people in the quickest time, radio is the way to go. So Senator Schacht is not correct in saying that radio is very expensive. In terms of the people reached, he would have to concede that radio is by far the cheapest form of electioneering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the logic of Senator Bolkus and Senator Schacht, and on this totally spurious argument of bought speech, we would have to exclude direct mail. Senator Harradine would not be able to run major direct mail campaigns and nor would Senator Kernot or Senator Coulter, because such campaigns are hugely expensive. So, on this famous logic of bought speech, if we want to buy that argument&mdash;and I do not wish to buy it&mdash;direct mail would certainly have to be banned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two questions that need to be answered. The first one was asked by Senator Walters. Without repeating Senator Schacht's remarks, I mention the Senate Select Committee, but I also refer Senator Walters to the Broadcasting Act, particularly subsections 119AB (1) and (2). It is worth reading those out in respect of the licences that we are talking about for the visually handicapped. Subsection (1) provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a condition of a public licence that the service provided pursuant to the licence is in accordance with the purpose for which the licence is granted.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (2) is interesting. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to this section, the holder of a public radio licence shall not broadcast advertisements.</PARA>
<PARA>There is already a fair degree of control exercised over these licences. As Senator Schacht quite rightly said, the particular service that is provided for the visually handicapped is essentially the reading of newspapers, editorials and the like. We do not anticipate it presenting a problem. That provision is one that has been very solidly sought by the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell asked a question about the definition of `public health matter'. The only answer I can give is in line with the answer I gave Senator Macdonald earlier on. Any interpretation of the Bill and definitions within it must, of course, finally go to the court system. The provision itself is very clear. The intention is to allow the promotion of public health matters, whether they be the eradication of diseases or other similar health problems that prevail in society, without canvassing a political health issue related to a particular health system. I do put in the word `political' in relation to the canvassing of a particular health system and, to that extent, a court would make an interpretation on whether the advertisement that Senator Campbell mentioned came within that definition. It is very hard for me from here to know what he has been watching on television from Western Australia, particularly if the honourable senator has been over here the last few days and the advertisement has been playing in Western Australia during that period. However, the intention is to allow the canvassing of public health issues but, at the same time, have some control over political issues which may come within that broad parameter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I could be a little more specific. When this legislation comes into effect, we will be looking at a real world situation where the Health Benefits Fund runs an advertisement&mdash;I am sure there are similar advertisements around Australia&mdash;which says, `Medicare will not cover dental work, physiotherapy or occupational therapy. You should take out HBF'. I ask the Minister: will that sort of advertisement be banned under this legislation because it says that Medicare is no good because it does not do this? The advertisement is obviously not specifically political, but someone who is afraid of Medicare being criticised, such as the Minister, could interpret it that way, as could the Electoral Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

If an election were called in four weeks time, would that advertisement be stopped by way of injunction? What sort of certainty can we give these private sector companies which, in good faith, put a lot of money into preparing these advertisements? In a roundabout way, the advertisements specifically criticise the public health system by saying, `The public health system does not give you this, but the private sector can. Take out some insurance with the private sector'. I think the Minister is duty bound to inform the Committee and the people of Australia what this clause means. Otherwise, as Senator Macdonald says, it will be a lawyers' paradise. If the Minister cannot inform the Senate what this specifically means, how is the rest of Australia meant to know?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of representations, not the least of which came from Commissioner Burdekin from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, who advised government that we have some commitment in this area. At the same time, it was recognised by the Government as a policy issue that there should be a continuation of advertising with respect to issues that go to public health. As I mentioned earlier, they go to the fabric of public health, community health and an individual's health. One can draw a line between public health matters that go to the aspects that I mentioned and political health matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government felt that it would be unfair, as a policy decision, to exclude public health from the ban.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find the response of the Minister somewhat unsatisfactory. If we are concerned about the public health of Australian citizens, should we also not be concerned about the health of people in Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Africa, for example? If that is the case, why does the Government not exempt organisations whose area of concern is to support programs for the alleviation of disease and poverty internationally? That would seem to me to be logical. If the Government is exempting the area of public health, those organisations should also be exempted&mdash;perhaps they are already exempt. `Public health' is not defined specifically as the public health of Australians. Does this relate to public health only in Australia or does it relate to public health in Papua New Guinea as well? Where does it start and where does it end?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus indicated that Commissioner Brian Burdekin had commented on this issue. I thought that his main concern related to the alleviation of poverty. That is contained in the exemptions for charitable organisations. I insist on knowing what the Government has in mind with respect to exemptions for public health matters. I ask this against a background of a particularly hot debate in Tasmania at present&mdash;I have not caught up with what has happened in the last day. The Legislative Council in Tasmania is very much opposed to proposals by the Tasmanian Government in a Bill relating to public health and AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Bill concerns an area of homosexual law and education in schools.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are probably two points to make. In respect of Senator Harradine's first point, the definition of `charitable organisation' probably picks up most of the organisations to which he refers.

In that respect, one would make a determination of the particular advertisements. If a particular candidate, for instance, was tied very strongly, or seen to be tied, to a particular issue, it would be very much up to the court to make an assessment as to whether the link was strong enough to ensure that the exemption would not prevail. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the argument being raised by Senator Macdonald is about the allocation of free time as it would apply in Queensland and where there are two opposition parties. The Queensland example raised by Senator Macdonald is where at the moment the two opposition parties have approximately the same percentage vote, give or take 5 per cent or so. The official Opposition is the National Party, which has a lot more seats than the Liberal Party. So in terms of seats, the formula we have before us is quite relevant. However, I think Senator Macdonald's argument is that the percentage vote is much closer and that, therefore, the official Opposition gets an advantage of much more free time to perhaps maintain the status quo of it being the larger opposition party. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">POLITICAL BROADCASTS AND POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We confirm that today we met with Sir Maurice Byers Q.C., former Solicitor General for the Commonwealth, to discuss with him proposed amendments to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments discussed with Sir Maurice related to proposals to amend the Broadcasting Act 1942 by modifying the proposed moratorium on the broadcast of political advertising and providing for a system of freetime election broadcasts. Under proposed Section 95DK of the Broadcasting Act, broadcasters will be compelled to allocate units of freetime (an undefined term) for the purposes of making election broadcasts during the relevant election period for the person to whom time has been granted. Under proposed Clause 95DK(5), a broadcaster is required to make that election broadcast free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed Section 95DK(7) provides that licensees required to make election broadcasts have an entitlement to such additional broadcasting time to broadcast other material (including advertisements and station promotions) as is determined by the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, Sir Maurice Byers views were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)Section 95DK is invalid because it is inconsistent with the protective guarantee of just terms in Section 51(31) of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)Even if the law could be categorised as being one with respect to the power granted by Section 51(5) of the Constitution (that is, a law with respect to "postal, telegraphic, telephonic and other like services") it would be invalid because "the effect of the purpose of paragraph (31) with its requirement for `just terms', in Section 51 is that other heads of power, including the incidental power" do not authorise legislation for the acquisition of property:  the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tasmanian Dam Case</EMPHASIS> (1983) 158 CLR 1, 282.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)Commercial television licensees have the right to sell time, without restriction, during a 24 hour day and that right is property for the purposes of Section 51(31) of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)The question whether just terms had been provided would turn on whether an allowance of extra advertising or promotional time per hour was practicable:  if it was not practicable then the acquisition would be unfair. If the acquisition was unfair then it would not be on "just terms".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Sir Maurice expressed the preliminary view that the Bill as a whole is inconsistent with the system of responsible Government envisaged by the Constitution, in particular, the free flow of information to electors. In his view, any law regulating elections that may have the effect of restricting the electorate's access to information may be unconstitutional.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To take this procedural matter a little further, Mr Chairman, experience generally is when these things are done on the run the consequences are sometimes worse than they were in the origin. We know in the origin there are big problems here. The Government is now, I think, acknowledging the deficiency. It is racing around getting advice, trying to find another set of words. As I said, I think history demonstrates that when the legislative process works on that basis a great deal of unfortunate consequence follows and there are further amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that clause 6 should be looked at overnight. I do not think the Minister should put his own advisers under the pressure that will result in problems in the outcome. The advisers should be able to take it away and carefully consider the matter and, with respect, they ought to have a talk with Senator Macdonald about some of the factual situations in Queensland and with Senator Harradine about some of the factual situations in Tasmania. It does seem on the face of the matter that the advisers operated purely from theory without taking into account what is on the ground at all. I guess when we start looking at other States we will find unique situations as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the clause. I will be extremely brief in responding to what has been said by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), Senator Bolkus, Senator Hill and, indeed, Senator Coulter. I do not want to appear to be standing up for my own rights in this respect and have not done so thus far in the debate except as an aside. However, from what I can understand, I have been truly shafted. I refer to the point made by Senator Coulter that, in his view, the allocation of time should be made on the percentage of votes cast in a particular election for a particular area for each candidate.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is fair in a situation such as that to remember two things: the parties that were elected and the percentage of votes gained. But in realistic and just terms how does one consider and fit my situation into the third aspect&mdash;the guaranteed 10 per cent? I refer not particularly to my situation but to the situation of my voters. I would be happy to have discussions with the Minister about that. </PARA>

There is not really a third party. I think the third party, the Greens, is part of the Government, but I am not quite sure of the situation in Tasmania.

<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that those parties which would be excluded from putting in a return for a particular financial year in respect of contributions to a political party or a branch of a party should be in legislation and not in regulation.

The Opposition has a lot of concerns about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is also concerned about the fact that the point relating to the amount of money above which a disclosure had to be made has been removed. Whereas previously it had been $1,000, the Government itself recommended, about 12 months ago, that the figure be $1,500. Then, Mr Chairman, it disappeared altogether. So our recommendation is that this clause be amended so that it brings back the regulations in regard to organisations and nominates the amount above which disclosure has to be made as $1,500. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, in responding to this I will go through a little history. It was initially the Government's intention to have a minimum benchmark under which contributions would not be disclosable. But we considered that and we also considered whether we should just have a blanket compulsion on disclosure. The problem we confronted was that we needed to provide flexibility. The only way that we felt we could do that was to provide for regulation making exclusions from the blanket disclosure provision. Those provisions&mdash;-</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will explain that in a second. The reason why the Government felt that was so was that there are a number of things that parties do and expend moneys on that they really would not want to have included in an overall package of disclosure; for instance, buying pencils, rubbers and other stationery is one level. One could say that could be accommodated by a benchmark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem we found was&mdash;and this was a problem that actually generated a lot of heat in Victoria&mdash;that it was felt that with a blanket disclosure provision parties would have to disclose all subscriptions, donations, gifts, et cetera to them, and in the process would have to disclose the membership lists of those organisations because they would be a contribution to the party. Those have been the two motivating concerns in respect to providing for exemption from disclosure. The regulation, as it is intended, will cover only those two types of areas. As I say, those regulations would be disallowable by this place. But it was very much born out of a concern that if one had a blanket provision then one would compel all contributors' names to be disclosed and, in that respect, membership names would be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question which I suppose may be asked is: if one has an exemption level of, say, $1,500, does that not cater for the membership and the minor expenditure and income arrangements?  The answer is that it does but only to a certain extent. The concern was that one could very well start up a $5,000 club or a $10,000 club or a $1,501 club which could be seen to be given special membership. It might be, as Senate Olsen and I would know in respect of our football club back in Adelaide, that one could have a membership of a special class who pay a certain amount of money, whether it be $1,000 or whatever. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a concern that by, for instance, just excluding membership fees by legislation there could be rorts on the definition of the term `membership fee', and membership of parts of an organisation could be dependent on the payment of a large amount of money. Therefore, we have not chosen to exclude by legislation membership fees, which is one of the motivating factors towards having this regulatory provision. Nor have we chosen to put a benchmark as hard as the $1,500 which is included in Senator Parer's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, our intention is to ensure, firstly, that those extremely minor amounts of money do not have to be disclosed and, secondly, that membership, bona fide or otherwise, is tackled to the extent that bona fide memberships are non-disclosable to the extent of the name of the person who is a member, but non-bona fide memberships are disclosable. In terms of bona fide memberships, a party would have to disclose the cumulative figure of membership. There is no debate about that. The other thing about this particular point is that the regulations would have to come back here and they would not operate in this instance, in respect of the disclosure provisions of the Act, unless the last date allowable for their disallowance had expired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motivation is very much to make the provisions work to that extent. That is why the Government has chosen to give some regulatory power.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I tried to go through the processes of explaining this. The reason we did not choose a figure of $1,500 was in recognition of the fact that quite often one might not have donations of less than $1,500 that one would want to disclose. Keeping that in mind, quite often there are donations of less than $1,500 that one may not want to disclose because they relate to the purchase of paper or whatever. That is why we have not gone for a hard and fast number.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I asked the Committee to keep in mind was the fact that we are, in this package, introducing the capacity in the Electoral Commission for spot audit. To the extent that any organisation tries to avoid the disclosure provisions, the Electoral Commission would have the capacity to comprehensively spot audit a registered political party or a third party organisation. As a consequence, we are quite confident that, with those spot audit powers and the extent of those powers, any evasive action would be tagged by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically what this does, as I said earlier, is provide some degree of flexibility in making the section operable in a way that does not mean that, on the one hand, a bona fide organisation has to disclose stuff that we do not need and, on the other hand, the Electoral Commission is preoccupied with vetting accounts that it otherwise would not vet. The basic point is that those regulations that determine what is and what is not would come to the Parliament and would be disallowable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I emphasise the point that we are talking about contributions or payments of $1,500 by a particular political party. If a political party buys typewriter ribbons, pencils or whatever, obviously it does not have to disclose that payment to the Commission because it is under the set amount. Likewise, in the area revenue and receipt of contributions, if a party received membership fees under the set figure of $1,500, it would not be obliged to provide the membership list. So I put to the Committee that the view of the Minister that this legislation would require membership lists to be placed before us is an absolute furphy. The Government has set the figure at $1,500 and the amounts below that therefore do not form part of the list and rightfully so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of expenditure items of major political parties has been identified. It is logical and sensible to note that one would not want a detailed list of, for example, the number of pencils and pens that a political party buys. The other point to be made in refuting what the Minister had to say and supporting the amendment is that surely we, on a matter of this importance, ought to be incorporating in legislation what those amounts ought to be so that any political party or government in the future would have to reintroduce legislation to the Parliament if it wanted to alter the figures. That is a very important point in my view. We are dealing with legislation which will operate in the future. It is the province of the Parliament, not the province of Executive Council, to do this. I think that very important principle ought to be embodied in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other problems that we have with the Opposition's proposal. The Opposition has put in line two of proposed section 311A(1) a requirement that a return be furnished within four weeks after the end of each financial year. I think it is very strongly felt that the eight week period that we have in our legislation is more appropriate. It gives the organisations involved a degree of time which may be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the enormity of the penalties that are involved when one lodges annual returns of income and expenditure and when one looks at the fact that in so many of the those cases there is the element of strict liability, I think one can see that one has to be fair and give the parties the extra four weeks in which to lodge their returns. As I say, there are some enormous penalties here. Under the Constitution, a person who breaches some of these penalties would be denied the ability ever to stand for parliament. I think it is important to have that eight week period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under paragraph (a) of proposed section 311A(1) there is a requirement for the lodging of returns with respect to `the political party or branch'.

I think there is a degree of confusion as to that particular term, which does present a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our alternative ensures that the political party lodges a return and, by and with the capacity for spot audit, branches are picked up whether they be State branches or others.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in subsection (1) requires particulars of a person or organisation who made a contribution to a registered political party or a State branch of a registered political party in a financial year to be included in a return if the value of the contributions, or the total value of all of the contributions, as the case may be, is less than $1,500.</PARA>
<PARA>That means that if the value is greater than $1,500 over a given year a payment would have to be included, so it would clean up the possibility&mdash;I think this is what the Minister might be referring to&mdash;of donations of $900 or $1,100, being less than $1,500, being excluded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the same amendment is another part that is very important to the Opposition. It is something that we have highlighted time and time again. It is the concern that we have with disclosure, or the giving of donations, with regard to discrimination not only towards a person by a hostile government or third party after a donation has been made, but also with regard to coercion that may well occur to force a donation from a reluctant donor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have very carefully spelled out the conditions under which this discrimination would apply.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penalty for offences is quite deliberately set at $5,000 for an individual or imprisonment for two years or both.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the amendment for a number of reasons.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice I have from the Electoral Commission is that clause 16 of the Bill already picks up subclauses (a), (b), (c), (e) and (f). We feel that we have accommodated those provisions within our proposed Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to subclause (d), there are a couple of problems. I am not sure that the Opposition has done this intentionally&mdash;I hope not. First of all, there is reference to a `statement'. The rest of the Act refers to `returns' and, to be consistent, we want to maintain that particular term. That is one problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Bill ensures that offences under Division 5A are incorporated into the rest of the penalty provisions by section 315(3) which is in clause 16. The direct impact of that, without going through all the technicalities, is that the penalties for the sorts of offences in subclause (d) under our proposal are $10 000, not $5,000, which is twice as much. I hope that this has not been done deliberately, and I will not even contemplate that. I am sure that, given the complexities of this particular part of the legislation, it has not. That is the first point. In respect of subclause 11, the penalties (e) and (f), we have penalties in the Act already which provide for $1,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations, certain benefits must generally be preserved until a member has attained 55 years of age and has retired from employment. Subject to the conditions of the relevant trust deed, such benefits may be paid out earlier than retirement on or after age 55 in the event of the member's death, permanent incapacity for work, permanent departure from Australia or in such other circumstances as the Commissioner considers appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the ISC was established and took over some of the superannuation functions of the Taxation Office, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner took the view that related Taxation Rulings should continue to apply until such time as they were reviewed and amended by the ISC.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions are similar to those previously in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the Tax Act).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That ruling generally restricts the release of benefits to cases where it is established that the member has incurred expenses through sickness, accident or other misfortune beyond his or her control and which would cause severe financial hardship if paid by the member from sources other than amounts withdrawn from the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the relocation of the former Tax Act provisions into the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations, effective from 1 July 1990, it was necessary to review those rulings as to their continued applicability.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Neither the Treasurer nor the ISC has issued instructions to delay the processing of release of benefit applications.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the ISC is investigating the feasibility of changes in procedures to speed up review of applications, including the possibility of fund trustees sharing the responsibility for reviewing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Generally, if all information is correctly submitted, the time lapse between receipt of an application and advice to the applicant of the outcome is 10 working days.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the recent announcement of lower sugar import quotas by the United States of America and low commodity prices and the serious implications for sugar growers in Australia, what is the Government doing to assist those growers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US reduction of the global sugar tariff quota is an extremely disappointing development for Australia especially as it comes on top of restraints placed on Australian meat exports to the US and the US-EC grain subsidy war.  The cut in the quota is also clearly inconsistent with the US espoused position in the GATT Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry is not alone amongst rural industries in experiencing the effects of depressed international prices and also the effects of the current drought.  The current rural downturn is being caused largely by overproduction in world agricultural markets, combined with the effects of export subsidies and other protection arrangements in a number of countries, notably the EC, the USA and Japan. The Australian Government is committed to improving the international trading environment and will persist in efforts in the Uruguay Round of GATT Trade Negotiations, and through other opportunities, to achieve enduring and beneficial reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has put much effort into achieving progress in the Uruguay Round negotiations and will continue to do so.  The negotiations are now entering a critical phase and the Government is taking every opportunity to exert pressure on the major participants to achieve meaningful reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the domestic economy, the Government has maintained its commitment to the process of microeconomic reform and has introduced a range of measures to ease the current difficulties while continuing to build a more efficient and prosperous economy.  These measures include lower tariffs across the board, changes to taxation arrangements, improved anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements and the phasing out of certain developing country preferences. This will mean lower input costs and greater competitiveness for the primary sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that assistance through the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) is an efficient way of targeting assistance to those farmers who really need it.  It deals even handedly with individual farming families and provides a very effective use of limited Commonwealth funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recently announced increased funding for the Commonwealth's Rural Assistance Package by a further $30.64 million.  The structural adjustment component of the RAS or Part A (which includes farm improvement and debt reconstruction measures) will receive $95.47 million in 1991-92.  The Commonwealth's contribution to Part B of RAS will be $23.67 million which will provide assistance to farmers to obtain carry-on finance for a period of up to two years. The Commonwealth/State contribution ratio has changed from 1:1 to 2:1, to encourage the States to fully implement Part B. $40 million has been allocated to Part C of RAS to provide income support and re-establishment grants to farmers without prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, a further $30 million will be provided over the next 2 years, for the provision of income support to assist farmers who have long term prospects but who cannot carry more debt, even with the interest subsidies provided under RAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 Federal Budget contained a range of measures designed to help people living in rural areas and facing hardship in the economic downturn. Key components of the Budget include revised eligibility rules for Family Allowance Supplements, assistance through AUSTUDY and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, and increased funding for the Rural Counselling Program.  Two new schemes, the Business Advisers for Rural Areas (BARA) Scheme and the Rural Industries Business Extension Service (RIBES) have been introduced to assist in the economic development of rural areas.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) All freight contracted to civil industry during Exercise Kangaroo 89 was contracted under the terms of a draft Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Department of Defence and the National Freight Forwarders Association (NFFA).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no single contract between Defence and TNT during Exercise Kangaroo 89. As a member company of the NFFA, TNT along with other member companies, was invited to submit quotations for particular freight movement requirements. Tasks were normally awarded to the firm providing the lowest quote. In some cases this was TNT. In others it was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TNT sub-contracted much of the work awarded to it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No changes have been made to the regulations that allow Army Reservists to take an option to go on periods of full-time duty, or as it is correctly known, full-time service. Implementation of these regulations has been tightened to approve full-time duty for Army Reservists only in circumstances where there is an operational requirement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In general the ADF only holds sufficient numbers of international maps for planning purposes, relying on exchange agreements with our principal allies for bulk stocks should the need arise. Under these exchange agreements the ADF is routinely provided with copies of the latest edition maps and aeronautical charts at scales smaller than 1:250000. Maps at larger scales may be available on request, however, third party caveats may preclude some of these requests being met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an area of rapid development a map can be "out of date" even before it is published, while in other areas where no development has occurred a map may remain fully up to date and current for many years. The age of a map is therefore not necessarily an accurate guide to its usefulness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The majority of the international maps held are between three and ten years old. All are the latest editions and therefore the best available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The maps held by the ADF prior to the invasion of Kuwait were the latest editions and were between one and six years old. In addition to the conventional mapping held, Army produced a satellite image map based on commercially available imagery acquired during 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The RAN Hydrographic Service is responsible for both the national and defence requirement for nautical charts. This will eventually entail the production and maintenance of 736 charts covering an internationally agreed area of Australian responsibility (which is larger than the area defined in the Dibb report). Production to date has resulted in the issue of 320 charts with the remainder estimated to take a further 20 years to complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Approximately 60% of the area of Torres Strait is either unsurveyed or inadequately surveyed. However, major shipping routes passing through the strait are well surveyed and charted to modern standards: operations can be conducted safely within these areas. All charts of the area clearly reflect the state of the surveys and indicate those areas inadequately covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) There will always be a risk in operating in inadequately charted areas, however, daylight operations are possible using established procedures for coral or poorly charted waters. Night operations would entail a greater risk, which would apply equally to any contacts of interest in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the well surveyed 40% of the Strait the risk would be low and comparable to normal peacetime operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) HMAS COOK was an oceanographic, rather than a hydrographic, survey vessel. It therefore did not contribute to the nautical charting programme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to decommissioning, HMAS COOK was being used primarily as a research vessel in support of DSTO and although there was some value to Navy in the work being conducted it was considered that this was not commensurate with the outlay involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) There are no private firms conducting hydrographic surveys for charting purposes within Australia's area of interest. Some firms are conducting surveys for offshore construction and resource exploitation, with some of the data being passed to the Hydrographic Service either spontaneously or on request.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The mandatory labelling of foodstuffs sold in Australia is a State and Territory responsibility.  I understand that most States and Territories have adopted the Australian Food Standards Code, which is now the responsibility of the National Food Authority.  The labelling of export foodstuffs is controlled by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service under the Export Control Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationally, the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission has established a general standard for the labelling of food and that standard states that when a food undergoes processing which changes its nature in a second country, the country in which the processing is performed shall be considered to be the country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Export Control Act 1982, and I understand the various State and Territory food laws, stipulate that unless foods undergo some form of treatment which alters their basic nature, they cannot be labelled as being of Australian origin.  This follows the international convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pierpont article in the Bulletin of 5 November 1991 specifically refers to fruit juice and I am informed that most States and Territories have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, a provision requiring the use of imported juice to be declared on the label.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Foodstuffs imported into Australia have to meet the standards set by the States and Territories in their food laws.  These laws generally reflect the provisions in the Australian Food Standards Code and it is the Code that is used in assessing imports where necessary.  I am confident that these standards provide adequate protection to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recognised in the Pierpont article Australia, as an exporting country, has to meet the demands of its customers.  Under those circumstances there may be differences in the standards.  From a quarantine perspective, Australian import standards are amongst the most stringent in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pierpont article does not distinguish between the role of Customs and the food inspection role of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).  AQIS is responsible for the inspection and certification of most export food products and the majority of meat produced for domestic consumption.  AQIS also administers the imported food inspection program which is based on a risk assessment of the public health dangers of the food in question against the Australian Food Standards Code.  Additionally, AQIS inspects plant and animal products for export and import  for quarantine purposes.  To undertake these tasks AQIS has a staff of some 1788 inspectors plus some 700 State and Territory employees who work under contract to AQIS. The article also fails to recognise the number of State and Territory employees who are involved in the enforcement of domestic food laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Service has a monitoring role in respect of the clearance of imported and exported foods in close liaison with AQIS personnel.</PARA>
