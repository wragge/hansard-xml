If Senator Ray does not agree, can he indicate what steps will be taken to further discipline the parliamentary Left following the obviously unsuccessful attempt to censure them last week?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have opposite is the nearest thing to a set of daleks I have ever seen. All they can pipe out is, `I shall obey'. The 30-odd opposite are political daleks. What is crucial in any of these events-and one of the things that the Labor Party has reasserted in recent days; it is the principle we have had since 1891-is collective decision making and support of those collective decisions. It has never been the tradition of the Labor Party not to have internal debate on these issues; we do, we have done so for 100 years now, and we will continue to do so for another 100 years. That is the nature of the Labor Party-to debate these issues, to consider them and to come to a collective decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How many times have we sat in this chamber and heard the other side criticise our collective decision making by saying what a terrible thing it is that we make collective decisions and stick by them and that we do not have a conscience or anything else? Here they are getting up today saying that we all have to think along exactly the same lines. In politics dissent and debate is a healthy thing; something that the other side should learn. Those opposite focus their differences exclusively on personality and ambition. At least we, on this side of the chamber, from time to time debate principled issues-and we will continue to do so during the next 100 years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of times over recent weeks I have been asked to quantify the additional cost of our deployment to the Gulf. In responding to those questions I indicated that there were appropriate processes of government to be followed. I can now report to the Senate that those processes are now complete. Yesterday I took to Cabinet a submission outlining the additional costs of our Gulf deployment, which covers areas such as additional service allowances, additional equipment items, equipment repair, replenishment stores such as fuel, rations and weapons, and administrative support expenses. Cabinet approved additional funds of $68.882m in 1990-91 to cover immediately one-time costs, and a further $27.475m spread over the following two years to cover replacement stores and equipment repair. This comes to a total of $96.357m. The funds sought will be covered in part-that is, $52.659m worth-by a special Appropriation Bill to be introduced into the House later this week and the remainder through the normal Additional Estimates process. I have to make it clear that much of the speculation in the press that put the figure at $150m was mere speculation and tended to be very poor journalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I point out that these are currently known costs. There may be additional costs, but if they exist a similar process will be gone through in which the Defence Department will seek to be fully supplemented for its commitment to the Gulf.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. I refer the Minister to an article in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald by Greg Austin which alleges that Australia has increased its commitment in the Gulf by sending up to 10 military intelligence specialists to Saudi Arabia. I ask: can the Minister confirm the details in that article?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="273" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much of that article happens to be incorrect. For instance, it quotes me as saying to Caucus yesterday that our commitment in the Gulf is $53m. First, I did not address Caucus yesterday on the subject and, secondly, as honourable senators can see from the figures alluded to in an earlier answer, it was quite a different cost for our Gulf commitment. Apparently there are currently 28 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel on exchange with the coalition forces in the Gulf. As one would expect, some of these are involved in planning and intelligence. I would like to quote what I said very clearly at a press conference on 25 January because the author of the article had not realised that I was on public record when I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We have people involved in the planning process both in Riyadh and in the naval command. Now I am not going into any more detail on that but they do get access to all information, are actively involved and they will bring back some very valuable lessons.</PARA>
<PARA>The figure I have mentioned today of 28 will fluctuate from time to time-anywhere between 20 and 35-as people who are on exchange and finish their rotations come back to Australia and more go onto rotation depending on which particular unit they are assigned to.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to make an announcement every time there is a minor change to numbers in the Gulf. For example, I saw no point particularly in announcing that we sent several radio technicians to make repairs to the radios of HMAS Westralia. The fluctuation in these figures obviously does not represent any major change in our commitment of forces to the Gulf. What I regard as major changes would be extra combat elements such as F111s, Hornets, infantry units or further ships. I think I should make it very clear that that is what we talk about in terms of escalation, not minor variations to numbers in the Gulf, which go up and down. In conclusion, let me say that the latest figure for ADF personnel serving in the Gulf today is 760.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Minister for Defence. I remind the Minister of his answer to a question from my colleague Senator Paul McLean on 12 November 1990 regarding the National Service Act 1951. After accusing Senator McLean of `misleading this place', the Minister went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The national service scheme was abolished by administrative measures immediately after the election of the Whitlam Government in December 1972 . . . The National Service Act was not repealed at the time because some national servicemen continued to serve in the Army and it was necessary to keep the Act in force. However, the National Service Termination Bill 1973 was passed. This made it clear that no-one is liable to register or render service under the National Service Act. It is clear beyond all doubt that the National Service Act could not be revived by an Executive or administrative action.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is perfectly plain that the National Service Act is completely defunct.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister's answer to Senator McLean was correct in November of last year, I ask: why is the Government now planning to repeal the National Service Act as reported in Melbourne's Sunday Age and admitted by the Prime Minister on Channel 9's Sunday program? Has the Government now looked more closely at that Act and discovered that the Minister was incorrect and therefore did the Minister mislead the Senate on 12 November last year?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be the case that one or two people have been knocking down a straw man that Senator Powell has managed to set up. I do not change any of my answer that I gave to Senator McLean. I believe I am correct. I have yet to have an opportunity to have a discussion with Mr Dawkins about this matter, but at the moment, on my reading of it, I happen to be correct. It may be that Mr Dawkins did not fully understand what the 1973 Act is about. I do not know yet; I will have to have that discussion with him. I maintain my position and I would be happy if Senator Powell, or someone else, can produce some evidence that, in fact, my position is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have seen is a continuation of the old conscription campaign being shoved out into the community by a range of people. False letters are still going out in a desperate attempt to link conscription with the Gulf commitment, because that is the only way some people think that they can create an emotive enough climate to establish opposition to the Government's position, which has been-and we are grateful for it-endorsed by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is about time the Australian Democrats and others accepted that this is an absolutely buried, dead issue. I repeat: this Government will not introduce conscription unless the territory of Australia is under attack and then we would need legislation carried by both chambers. That is in the Australian Labor Party platform of the 1988 conference, fully endorsed by this Government and it will be abided by this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of conscription is an irrelevant red herring introduced by gullible people trying to distort our Gulf commitment. I do not want anyone coming to me and saying, `This is just accidental'. We are still getting people ringing radio stations saying that the Government Printing Office is printing off the forms. Not one form has been produced out of all these allegations. False letters are still going out to people of eligible age saying that they are liable to be conscripted. I do not know who is masterminding this campaign. I know the people opposite are not-of course they are not; nevertheless, I think they are encouraging it. I stand by my answer of November until somebody can point out exactly where I am wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support comment upon recent media criticism about the revised stevedoring employment arrangements approved by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) for the port of Cairns, particularly adverse comments about the likelihood of achieving the required reduction in the stevedoring work force?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="274" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="SHIPPING AND AVIATION SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been considerable adverse criticism of a provisional agreement between the Stevedoring Employers of Australia Ltd (SEAL) and the stevedoring union in Cairns, endorsed recently by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. A great deal of that criticism has centred around claims that have been made that the 13 workers who would be made redundant in the port of Cairns as part of this provisional agreement would not accept those voluntary redundancies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, at a major seminar on shipping and waterfront issues that I addressed in Sydney this morning, during the question time session-which is when most of the criticism was laid-the senior executive of one of the major users of the port of Cairns asserted that we would not get the union to deliver its commitment to persuade 13 of its members to leave Cairns under voluntary redundancy because, as he put it, the redundant workers have got little to do, live in a very congenial climate and are on good wages.</PARA>
<PARA> I am able to advise the Senate now that a short time ago I was very pleased to be advised by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority that in response to the offers of redundancy that were issued by SEAL, 13 workers in the port of Cairns have now formally accepted those offers of redundancy and will leave the port. The target date that has been set for their actual exit from the port is 28 February.</PARA>
<PARA> An annual saving of around $360,000 will be made by reducing by 60 per cent the current port work force. The only reason I mention that is that, had this offer, which was made by the Government through WIRA last year, been accepted at the time, this level of savings could already have been achieved in the Port of Cairns. I regret that that was not the case, but I can assure honourable senators, despite assertions to the contrary, that the negotiation process in Cairns has not been quite as simple and clear cut as people would have it. Most of the parties involved in the negotiations, not just the unions, have changed their positions substantially during those negotiations. I stress that this is a provisional agreement. It will simply open the way for an immediate and significant reduction in the cost of operating the Port of Cairns and it will open the way for the negotiation of a final agreement for that port.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that, despite all the criticism, I am grateful for the assistance that was given by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority and the role it played in negotiating this settlement. I am also grateful, particularly as a result of a number of personal visits I made to Cairns and meetings that were held there, for the personal assistance of and contribution that was made to achieving this partial resolution of the problem in Cairns by the honourable member for Leichhardt, Mr John Gayler.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Given that Australia is now looking, along with the rest of the world community, to a post-war settlement in the Middle East, will the Minister confirm that the Australian Government will give a high priority to seeking a resolution to the internal strife in Lebanon?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has constantly made clear our view that, once the Gulf crisis is resolved, the international community will have not just the opportunity but the very heavy responsibility to address the other causes of continuing instability in the Middle East. Among those is the continuing unhappy situation in Lebanon, in particular the presence of foreign forces there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question of any linkage, of course, in this respect. These are separate and distinct issues. The Gulf crisis must be solved first but, when it is solved, that, along with the question of the security of Israel and the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for recognition and respect, will be very high on the agenda. Certainly, I think everyone in this country feels very deeply the tragedy and the destruction which has plagued Lebanon for so many years and which has touched the lives of so many Lebanese Australians. Efforts, however, that have already now been begun by the Lebanese people themselves give grounds for some optimism that major progress can be made now on Lebanon's underlying constitutional and political problems.</PARA>
<PARA> The Taif accord, which was agreed by an overwhelming majority of Lebanese parliamentarians in October 1989, sets out a new Lebanese national charter aiming at political reforms and other steps to resolve the fundamental causes of the civil war. The most important of those reforms is the political power sharing between Christians and Muslims in an enlarged Parliament, and also the agreement on a framework for the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon and the extension of the Lebanese Government's authority throughout Lebanon. Some progress has been achieved in implementing the Taif accord since October 1989 but serious problems remain, obviously, in the way of ensuring enduring peace and security, not least the question, as Senator Hill pointed out, of the Syrian forces remaining on Lebanese land, tarnishing conspicuously in that respect claims of Lebanese sovereignty. There is also, of course, Israel's continued occupation of its self-styled security zone in Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA> These destabilising factors underline that while the Taif agreement has been a major step in the right direction, foreign intervention is still a constraint on the Lebanese authorities' capacity to exercise full control over their territory. We can simply all hope that discussions once the Gulf crisis is over will provide an opportunity for the international community to assist in the implementation of that agreement, and the achievement of lasting peace and security in that part of the Middle East.</PARA>

In fact, they are able to get in some of those banks and financial institutions an advantage, given of course the decades that have gone by when billions of dollars of pensioners' money was left in these institutions to earn 4, 5 and 6 per cent to be lent out at 15 to 20 per cent.

<PARA> The banks have tracked the Government's decision and because for single pensioners the first $2,000 is going to be deemed at the actual rate received, and if that is nothing then we will deem it at nothing, the banks have made in many cases the first $2,000 interest free. This has not happened in all cases. The Commonwealth Bank gives 10 per cent from the first dollar in its special account for pensioners. That being the case, because that 10 per cent is available from the first dollar--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I will need to do that. Then, in looking at what the banks would do if indeed the rate was dropped, the intention of the banks, of course, would be to continue to track the Government's decision. So, as long as the first $2,000 was free-that is, free of interest as far as our legislation is concerned-the banks, if I reduced it to 9 per cent tomorrow, would still have the same conditions applying and so the problems to which some people referred in the last few days would not go away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have got to look at are the enormous pluses for pensioners involved in this. In the absence of other income it is still the case that any single pensioner with less than $20,000 in the bank is not going to be affected by this measure. Even if they were going to put money in an account that required more than $2,000 to get the relevant rate of interest, the reality is that they have got to have a lot more than that to even be affected by this and to have to worry.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the misleading statements which some have made on this and which have tended to frighten pensioners into believing that every one of them is affected when, in fact, very few are-and even though the Department has already written to those it can readily identify as being affected by deeming-I will be writing to all aged pensioners over the course of the next few weeks to make sure that all of them have, yet again, the real message about deeming; that is, that every person affected finishes up with more disposable income.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that we have received confirmation through the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei that the Taiwanese authorities have imposed discriminatory measures against imports of Australian shin, shank and brisket beef worth some $62m in 1990 but not, as was reported, against imports of high quality beef. The measures that have been imposed against the lower quality beef are these: first, a reduction in the length of validity of import licences from six months to three months; secondly, the imposition of a handling levy on total transaction values to be paid on application for an import licence rather than, as is usually the case, on raising a letter of credit; thirdly, restricting the coverage of licences to one item only; and fourthly, no extensions of licence validity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In December last year, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation held discussions in Sydney with representatives of Taiwan's trade and agricultural agencies on access for these categories of beef during the current 1990-91 year. The Australian industry rejected Taiwan's proposal that the industry agree to limit exports in 1991 to levels substantially below those shipped in recent years. Although a common position acceptable to both sides was not reached at the December round of discussions, the door was left open for further consultations. There was no advice from Taiwan that further action was being contemplated.</PARA>
<PARA> I should say more generally that, over the past 18 months, Taiwan has adopted a number of discriminatory measures against imports of Australian beef for which there has been no shred of justification. This discrimination can only be seen as inconsistent with the spirit of our overall bilateral trading relationship, not to mention Australia's reputation as a reliable and competitive supplier to the Taiwan market. Taiwan's move to discriminate further against imports of Australian beef is absolutely at odds with its stated commitment to trade liberalisation and, for that matter, its aspirations to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's very strong objection to these latest discriminatory actions has been conveyed to the Taiwan authorities at appropriately senior level through the Australian Commerce and Industry Office. In response, Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade has noted that the measures outlined above apply to all sensitive agricultural imports. The Australian Government will not let this matter rest with that kind of reply and will continue to pursue, through appropriate channels, improved access arrangements for Australian beef to the Taiwan market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In so far as the Budget surplus is concerned, let me state quite clearly that there will be a significant shortfall in the projected 1990-91 surplus. The extent of that shortfall is very difficult to calculate precisely at present; however, it is implicit in what I said that it is believed that there will be a surplus, which answers one part of the question, and that will be a major force for national savings. In so far as the reduction in the surplus is concerned, it can be readily understood that tax receipts have fallen, unemployment benefits have risen and there has been no fiscal relaxation by the Government other than in respect of the tax cuts which commenced on 1 January this year which, amongst other things, are designed to have a stimulatory effect and to help reduce inflation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the Sunday program with its very diverse array of estimates of civilian casualties. Do I accept that even if only one civilian had been killed in each bombing raid on Iraq the death toll would now be over 40,000? The arithmetic is impeccable, but the premises on which it is based are really highly challengeable. The truth of the matter is that less than half of the 40,000 or more sorties that have been flown since this war began were in the nature of bombing raids involving either carpet bombing or the use of precision and guided bombs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rest of them have been in the nature of air defence suppression, combat air patrols, airborne early warning, airborne refuelling or transport missions of one kind or another. Indeed, of those less than half the number of sorties that have been in the nature of bombing raids, a very high proportion have been directed at purely military targets in the sense that there is no likelihood whatsoever of a civilian being present-for example, Scud sites or forward military positions in Kuwait. There is simply no foundation, as I say, for that kind of emotive arithmetic.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the actual estimates of civilian casualties, it is simply not possible for the coalition side to make any credible estimates of the civilian casualties that have occurred in Iraq or Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, and no attempt at an estimate has been made, except that it is appropriate for me to make the point that no civilian targets have been attacked as such by the coalition forces during the entire course of this war, nor is it intended that they be. The intention has been, and the effect has been, to target very narrowly, precisely and, for the most part, extremely effectively. Many eye witness accounts have referred to the very great precision of the coalition bombing raids and, indeed, of coalition aircraft risking returning to base fully laden with ordnance simply because targets could not be properly verified and because of the danger and difficulty of misplacing them in civilian directions.</PARA>
<PARA> I should further make the point that the coalition's task is complicated by what appears to be a conscious Iraqi tactic of moving military equipment into civilian areas, concealing arms production and research facilities in what have been previously regular industrial complexes and, furthermore, by the massive scale of the Iraqi military establishment, which means that strategic facilities are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country.</PARA>
<PARA> Having made all those qualifications, all one can do in terms of assessing civilian casualties is refer to the Iraqi Government's own published figures, and we are simply unable to judge what degree of accuracy they may represent. However, the published figures for civilian casualties are 467 dead and 400 injured. The only other country for which I have any casualty figures available is Israel, and the Government's own figures there are four dead and 299 now injured.</PARA>

I will take advantage of that interjection from Senator Crichton-Browne to make the very obvious point that not only from the coalition's side has there been an extraordinarily intense and dedicated effort to avoid civilian casualties, but also the contrast between that and the attitude and behaviour of the Iraqi side could not be more apparent, not least in the quite explicit targeting of civilian populations in Saudi Arabia and Israel. Beyond that there is Saddam Hussein's spectacularly obvious disregard for casualties among his own ground forces, which he has now committed to militarily disastrous action, his overt public threats to use weapons of mass destruction and, indeed, his record of appalling behaviour towards the civilian population of Kuwait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the final question, whether I would undertake never to use the appalling euphemism `collateral damage', the honourable senator and the Senate will know that I have some difficulty in making an undertaking not to use appalling language generally, but I will do my best in future as far as that specific request is concerned.</PARA>

In fact, he had not delivered it at that point. I think it came later. I do not know whether he had spoken to his Leader about this, but I do know that by the time the second edition came out the headline was not that Libs would `end award super' but that Libs would `curb award super'. In any event, what he did commit the Liberal Party to-and this is what I am asked about-was amending the Industrial Relations Act so that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission `could not facilitate, let alone insist on, arbitrary across the board superannuation increases'. I thought that was interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might say that we have not finished yet, even after two goes, because Senator Alston bobbed up again in the `Letters to the Editor' column yesterday-just to keep everyone on their toes-and this time the headline was, `Coalition wants to expand super'. I have to say that it was a bit difficult to justify the third one. We might not have had a lot of trouble with the first two, but we could have some real trouble with the third. Senator Alston tried to argue that the present system was unfair because it gave trade unionists-those horrible, nasty trade unionists-award super increases while some others missed out.</PARA>
<PARA> One wonders what we are objecting to. Even since 1985 award superannuation coverage has extended from 40 per cent of the work force to about 55 per cent now. What is wrong with a 15 per cent increase in the number of those who have gained access to superannuation? As far as I am concerned, the Government remains committed to that extension of superannuation across the board, which will, of course, ensure that future governments-no matter what political persuasion they might be-are able to assist in providing retirement incomes and that people themselves will have already assisted in it and increased the standard of living to which they are entitled and which they might expect in their later years.</PARA>
<PARA> But, of course, Senator Alston has gone backwards. He has gone back to the system of some years ago. Before we came in there were the Fraser-Howard years, advised by John Hewson. The system for superannuation was, `The boss has got it and the workers miss out'. The well-off got big tax concessions and superannuation was voluntary only for the bosses. This Government remains absolutely committed. We will bat on with extending superannuation across the board; we will bat on with providing better retirement incomes for Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report to which Senator Childs referred and indeed another one in the same vein in the Canberra Times this morning. The Government's position on the resumption of sporting links with South Africa has been perfectly clear for a very long time and has also been made clear, in the new context that has existed since the recent changes in South Africa and, in particular, the speech of President de Klerk on 1 February, by recent statements of the Prime Minister. Whether lifting of the sports boycott is considered as part of a phased relaxation of sanctions generally or whether it is looked at on its own terms, the Australian Government's position is that it can be contemplated only in respect of those sports which achieve a unified, non-racial structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In some sports, such as soccer and cricket, very significant progress towards such integration has already been achieved. However, similar progress simply has not been achieved in rugby. There are some encouraging signs, for example, in the statement on 7 February following a meeting between South African Rugby Board President Craven and the African National Congress. It was emphasised that the unity of rugby was a matter of extreme urgency. The difficulty is that any such perception there may have been in the past has not yet been mirrored by actions so far as the effective consolidation of the two rugby bodies is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Under these circumstances it would be quite premature for there to be any planning for any tour of South Africa by any Australian rugby team, let alone any visit to Australia by a Springbok team. Certainly the Australian Government would be wholly opposed to any such tours taking place before the integration of the sport in South Africa was complete.</PARA>
<PARA> All that said, I should immediately acknowledge that I do not believe there is any difference between the Australian Government and the Australian Rugby Football Union (ARFU) in this respect, notwithstanding the impression one would glean from reading that newspaper report and particularly its headline and opening paragraphs. In the article in question the President of the ARFU, Joe French, said that any such tours were subject to the abolition of the sports boycott. He also referred to the important talks which have taken place and which, we hope, will now accelerate between the South African Rugby Board and the predominantly non-white South African Rugby Union.</PARA>
<PARA> I should add that it is also my understanding-and I have been helped in this respect by reports I have received from Senator Schacht since his very productive visit there a few days ago-that the South African Government would itself regard such tours, prior to the implementation of the necessary reforms within the sporting organisations themselves, as being wholly counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to record my appreciation and that of the Government for the attitude of Mr French and the ARFU on this issue. In the face of very considerable pressure from within their own organisation, they have consistently both understood and supported the Government's position. I am confident that the Rugby Football Union and other sporting bodies in Australia will continue to respect a government position which I believe captures the sentiment of the Australian people on this important issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister for Defence. I emphasise that I prepared this question long before Senator Vallentine's urgency motion was circulated. I ask: does the Minister agree that, because of the revelations about the arming of Iraq, the Australian people are now more starkly aware than ever of the immorality of, and the dangers inherent in, the international arms trade? As a practical and symbolic step towards eliminating Australia from the arms trade, will the Minister consider abandoning all Government involvement in, and association with, the AIDEX arms fair later this year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not bore the Senate with two speeches in a row on this, so I shall be quite brief. I think the premise in Senator Coates's question is right. One has to learn lessons from history and current events. One of the lessons the world can learn is as to its attitude to the international arms trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear, when one looks at the armaments in Iraq, that the majority came from the Soviet Union-one of the major powers. That is evident in the tanks, the planes, the anti-aircraft batteries, et cetera. It is equally obvious that some of the missiles and planes came from western Europe, and some of the other technologies required-not as direct defence export-also came from western Europe. I think that we have a reasonable record with regard to arms exports to regions of instability-it is certainly better than most over a long period.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the exhibition, that is a privately sponsored exhibition and has been for a number of years when it occurs. Without judging it either way, I am going to look into what involvement the Australian Government and the Department of Defence will have in it. I believe there are two areas identified at the moment for involvement. I am going to have a look at that. I am not prejudging it and saying yes, I will cancel our involvement or, no, I will not. I will look at it on its merits, also taking into account changed circumstances. If we do not learn from history I do not think we achieve much.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 January this year Senator Knowles asked me a question about a memo allegedly circulated by the Insurance Council of Australia relating to insurance claims in the event of a terrorist attack connected with the Gulf war. I have had an opportunity to circulate the answer to Senator Knowles. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard and to table accompanying documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>`` . . . ICA has not circulated, either internally or publicly, any document which makes any reference to governments (Australian or otherwise) being called on to cover the cost of personal injury and property damage in the event of a terrorist attack in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>ICA's national operations manager distributed an internal memorandum to our regional offices on 17 January, drawing their attention to some of the insurance-related matters which usually arise when a war or war-like situation arises anywhere in the world''.</PARA>
<PARA>I table a copy of that memorandum which was also provided to the National Insurance Brokers Association for their information.</PARA>
<PARA>The ICA also sent me a copy of a statement issued by the Association of British Insurers in London which reflects the general advice given in ICA's internal memorandum. The ICA claims that this is typical of the sort of general statement which insurance associations throughout the world are likely to make in the wake of a war being declared. I table that statement.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Insurance Brokers Association (the Association representing insurance brokers throughout Australia) issued a press release which does make reference to the international practice of specifically excluding claims arising directly or indirectly from war or nuclear risks-and the NIBA press release comments that the `government of the country concerned' may be expected to pay compensation. I table that statement.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I believe the most important aspects of the ICA's internal memo are the dot points at page 2 which, in essence, say that each case would need to be considered individually. If there is a dispute between an insurer and a claimant then there are legal avenues which can be pursued to resolve that dispute.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented in remarks made by Senator Richardson in answer to a question from Senator Crowley. Senator Richardson has chosen to leave already. Nonetheless, the clear implication of what was said by him was that the headlines in the Age newspaper on 7 February were, somehow, ones that I had sought to influence in the sense that the first headline clearly grotesquely distorted the text of the article by suggesting that the Opposition would propose to end award superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the correction to that second headline came about entirely as a result of action taken by the Age itself, and communicated to me in the course of an apology for getting it wrong in the first instance. My letter was clearly intended to clarify that matter in order to put to rest the sorts of headlines that Senator Richardson referred to as `ending' rather than restricting. </PARA>
<PARA> I take further exception to the clear suggestion that he made that we were proposing to abolish the award superannuation scheme whereas, in fact, if he had bothered to read the speech, he would have noted that we were concerned about the across the board add-on 3 per cent. We were urging very strongly that the concentration ought to be on ensuring a minimum spread. </PARA>
<PARA> The further misrepresentation was in suggesting that somehow it was intended to revert to the `bad old days' when workers missed out. Again, the speech makes it very clear that, in fact, under the current award system workers in general are still missing out very badly indeed. In fact, only 40 per cent of the private sector work force-which is little more than the number of persons who belong to trade unions in the private sector-are benefiting from award superannuation; something approaching $1 billion is outstanding in award orders; and there is a massive non-compliance about which the Government has done nothing. Therefore, I take exception to the suggestion that somehow we were condoning--</PARA>

I think I have adequately dealt with them. The fact is that at no stage was it ever suggested that we wanted to go back to any system, or indeed to adopt a system, where workers missed out. My criticisms of the award superannuation system are driven very much by the desire to extend the system of superannuation-not to end or curb it but only to award superannuation which involves an add-on 3 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Saturday, 5 January 1991, of Edward Albert Robertson, Senator for the Northern Territory from 1975 to 1987, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Ted Robertson was born on 18 March 1929 in Albany in Western Australia and was educated at Claremont Teachers College and the University of Western Australia. In the early 1960s he moved to the Northern Territory where he was appointed to a succession of senior administrative posts, eventually becoming Assistant Director of Education for the Territory. He also served as a Reserve officer in the Royal Australian Air Force as an instructor with the air training corps. </PARA>
<PARA> His election to the Federal Parliament in 1975 as senator for the Northern Territory was distinguished by the fact that he was one of the Territory's first elected representatives to Federal politics. He served admirably for 12 years until his retirement in 1987. In the course of his parliamentary career he served on many committees and led some overseas delegations to Thailand and Indo-China. Of course, as all honourable senators who were here at the time will know, he served as an Australian Labor Party Whip in the Senate for seven years, first as Opposition Whip from 1980 and then as Government Whip from 1983, following the election of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted Robertson made a distinguished contribution not only to the Senate but also to the Australian Labor Party and to the general well-being of politics in the Northern Territory. This commitment was recognised as far as the Labor Party was concerned in 1986 when he was made a life member of the Party. As far as I personally am concerned, Ted Robertson and I spanned a common period in politics. He was elected less than a year after I was. I always regarded him as a person who was prepared to do a lot of hard work behind the scenes in politics to keep the political system going. He was a very solid backbencher-some people might say in more ways than one-and was very diligent in discharging his role as an Opposition backbencher. That was even more apparent when he became Whip for the Opposition and for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As Leader of the Opposition and then Leader of the Government I worked very closely with him as a Whip and he did that job very well. In some ways he was a traditional, conservative Labor Party man. I use the word `conservative' in the best possible sense of the word. He was conservative in his values which were very decent ones. He described himself as a Depression child. He used to say that his family ate regularly during the Depression but nonetheless it was in those years that the foundations of his beliefs and commitments to social justice came about. Ted used to say that he was born an Anglican and a Labor person. Although he recognised, as he used to put it, that there were deficiencies in both systems-Anglican and Labor-none of those deficiencies was sufficient to make him ever change. </PARA>
<PARA> When I visited the Territory over a number of years I always had a tremendous impression, which I think Opposition senators will share and Senator Collins will understand, about his involvement in various aspects of Territory life. He was a member of a wide range of community organisations-the Northern Territory Council of Social Service, the Young Men's Christian Association, of which he was recently National President, Austcare and Apex. He was greatly interested in young people and I believe he was always interested in helping the underdog. </PARA>
<PARA> He will be remembered as a modest man of dignity and integrity with a deep sense of duty and honour both to his constituency and the institutions to which he belonged. I think he was well respected by his peers. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his family-to his wife, Audrey, and to the other members of his family-our sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I join with the Leader of the Government in expressing our deep regret at the death of Ted Robertson in January at the age of 62. As Senator Button said, Ted Robertson was an Australian Labor Party senator for the Northern Territory from 1975 until his retirement in 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On a personal level I will remember Ted Robertson as a sincere, dedicated and courteous senator. He was first and foremost a Territorian. His background was in education and on moving to the Territory in the early 1960s he was appointed to a succession of senior administrative posts, eventually becoming Assistant Director of Education. He was, as has just been said, with Senator Kilgariff, one of the first elected federal representatives of the Northern Territory. He saw the Senate as having its original function, that being a forum for the States and, in his case, for the Territory. His role, as he saw it, was to serve the best interests of the Territory even if that involved criticising decisions of his Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robertson was very active in committee work with his interests primarily in the areas of education, social issues and Aboriginal affairs. He was the parliamentary representative on the Council of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies for a total of more than seven years. He was, as has been said, the Australian Labor Party Whip in the Senate from November 1980 until his retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with and note a comment about his wide involvement with many community organisations-Apex, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the Council of Social Service, Rostrum and Junior Farmers. That indicates the style of the person. After his retirement Senator Robertson continued his active involvement in community affairs and became President of the YMCA. </PARA>

On many occasions, I had the need to call on Ted and to ask for his assistance and his interest, which were always readily available. Not only did he assist materially in the work that had to be done, but I found him to be an extremely humane person; extremely concerned about the welfare of citizens in the Northern Territory-at the best of times a fairly rough and ready society. Mr President, I will never forget his obvious deep concern for Aboriginal people, for people that were destitute and for the ordinary citizens of the Territory. I know that everyone in this place would wish to join with me in passing on our deepest condolences to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a Northern Territory senator and on behalf of my colleagues in the National Party of Australia and in the Northern Territory Country-Liberal Party, I am very pleased to be associated with this condolence motion for the late Ted Robertson. I was pleased to enjoy his friendship and I know the special regard that he was afforded by my colleagues in both the Northern Territory Country- Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ted Robertson served this Senate with five terms; that is, 12 years as a senator and as a public representative for the Northern Territory electorate. He was a good and gentle man. He had a warm and personable character. He was a very committed Christian. I would like to quote from the address given by Bishop Clyde Wood at the memorial service to Ted Robertson in Darwin at the Anglican cathedral on 8 April. He said of Ted Robertson:</PARA>
<PARA>He was a Christian gentleman . . . but not a saint of no earthly use. </PARA>
<PARA>That, indeed, was a very high accolade to Ted Robertson. He was certainly a man of very sound principles and important family standards. He had a deep respect for all human life. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted Robertson will be remembered with a special mark in the Northern Territory for his significant contribution in the fields of Aboriginal affairs and education. He had a sense of community service and dedication which was particularly borne out in his membership of many organisations. It has already been mentioned that he played an important role in the Young Men's Christian Association and, in fact, went on to become national president, but he also served as a representative of this Senate in the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to serve personally with him as a trustee of the Cyclone Tracy Relief Trust Fund, which was set up in Darwin following Cyclone Tracy. He was also a Reserve officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, and many young people in Darwin will remember him in that role. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, his background as an educator demonstrated considerable acumen and, in particular, he played a sensitive role in developing many Aboriginal education policies which have now come to fruition. Ted Robertson also leaves a mark in Canberra both in politics and in the Australian Labor Party. He had a flair for organisation, public speaking and chairmanship; and whilst he often demonstrated, as I said earlier, warm and personable characteristics, he had a determination that survived various and very determined odds. </PARA>
<PARA> As a senator, I know that the constituents of the electorate that Senator Collins and I have inherited from him hold him in deep regard for the helpful and welcoming manner that he gave to our particular constituency. He never gave up trying to stop human rights violations and helping refugees and their families. In particular, he will be remembered in the Northern Territory for his contribution to many of the refugees who migrated to Australia from Timor.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has mentioned, in his role here as the Labor Party Whip, he gave attention to detail that I am sure many colleagues who shared time with him in the Senate came to appreciate. In many ways, Ted Robertson was probably one of the casualties of politics because he refused to align factionally, and he held to important points of principle and not pragmatism. In fact, he showed this very positive style even at the end of his political life when his demise in politics was, to a large extent, engineered by the left and right factions of his own Labor Party in the Northern Territory to accommodate the ambitions of others coming through. Ted Robertson accepted that position even when he was downgraded on the Senate ticket. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly enjoyed many lively and political discussions with both Ted and Audrey Robertson in their time in the Northern Territory. I know that I pass on the condolences and share the condolences of the Northern Territory of many of my colleagues to Audrey Robertson and her family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join in this condolence motion. My personal association with Ted Robertson, which over the last 10 years was a close one, extends back almost 20 years. I remember Ted when he was an inspector of schools in Arnhem Land and I was then working and living in Aboriginal communities. Even at that stage-I am talking about the late 1960s and early 1970s-Ted was a strong, very isolated supporter of the Labor Party out in the bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I mention that is that Senator Button referred to one of Ted's qualities which, I guess in political terms, did not do Ted all that much good, and that was his capacity as a backroom worker. Principally, that is what I want to speak about briefly this afternoon because that is certainly how he will be remembered with gratitude by the rank and file members of the Australian Labor Party in the Northern Territory. He played an absolutely crucial role in getting the party onto some sort of professional footing. </PARA>
<PARA> As election results attest, the Labor Party has a difficult row to hoe in the Northern Territory, which is a rough and ready society with a frontier approach to things like development issues. As our political daily bread, we have to deal with issues such as the environment and with Aboriginal issues as opposed to, as it often is, development in the broad sense of the word. That has been our meat and drink in Territory politics for a long time. It is very often hard for the Labor Party, which has a principle stand on many of these issues, to survive and prosper. I recall only too well the results of the 1974 election in the Northern Territory. We stood a candidate in every seat and got absolutely demolished; we did not win a single seat. The result of the election was 17 Country-Liberal Party members and two Independents. It was a very hard row to hoe. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I mention that is that in 1974 very senior figures in the Labor Party, such as Senator Graham Richardson, came to the Territory-I remember him then as a very youthful party organiser-and they could not believe what they found when they stepped from the plane in Darwin as to the state of the Territory party. We were not a very professional organisation in those days. It was Ted Robertson who almost solely provided the initiative to reform the Party in the Territory and to, in fact, write the constitution which we still use in the Northern Territory. He became president of the founding branch of the Labor Party-the Darwin branch-subsequently became president for a time of the Territory branch of the Labor Party and served on the national executive of the Labor Party. He was responsible for steering that constitution through the national executive of the Labor Party and putting the Northern Territory Labor Party on a professional footing. I had a close working relationship with him when I led the Party in the Territory. For some significant period he was the only Federal representative the Territory had. </PARA>
<PARA> He was, of course, the first Labor senator for the Northern Territory. As a result of initiatives that were taken by the Whitlam Government in providing for territorial representation, he was elected in 1975. The then Country Party challenged that matter and took it all the way to the High Court of Australia where, fortunately for Senator Tambling and me, the National Party of Australia lost and Ted's position in the Senate was confirmed. He very diligently served as the Whip for the then Opposition for seven years and, subsequently, for the Government in the Senate. Whilst, as is inevitable in politics, we both had a conservative outlook in life-we had our disagreements over the years-I had the same approach to Ted as every other member of the rank and file. I respected him for his integrity, his dignity and the enormous contribution he made behind the scenes in getting the Labor Party in the Northern Territory on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA> In his private and public life Ted had a significant involvement on three particular issues. I think they have all been mentioned, but I can certainly attest to them first hand: firstly, education; secondly, Aboriginal issues; and, thirdly-this has not been mentioned at this point but deserves to be-his stand on East Timor. Ted had a very strong public and private stand on East Timor and a close involvement with the Timorese community in Darwin. Unfortunately I was not able to attend his funeral in Canberra. Senator Tambling and I attended the memorial service for Ted in Darwin at a packed Anglican cathedral. Many members of the Darwin Timorese community came to that memorial service. Ted is remembered with very great affection and respect by the Timorese community in Darwin. He had a very deep involvement with organisations such as the Young Men's Christian Association and eventually became elected as its National President. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the members of the Northern Territory Labor Party and all the people of the Northern Territory, I express my thanks for the contribution that Ted Robertson made, both before and after entering Parliament, to advancing the interests of the Northern Territory. He was a political representative of the Northern Territory and is remembered with respect and with thanks by all Territorians who knew him or were touched by the work that he did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to be associated with this condolence motion and extend my deep sympathy to Ted Robertson's family. Neither distance, such as that between Tasmania and the Northern Territory, nor party barriers can prevent friendships across party lines where there are common links bringing people together. Perhaps one aspect of Ted Robertson's life that has not been fully addressed today is his membership of and his work for the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). I recall Senator Tambling and some others mentioning that he went on to become National President. As I saw it, the YMCA was very much Ted's life, and he was justly rewarded with the national presidency. I believe that not only the YMCA but also education and other community areas will be very much at a loss as a result of losing Ted Robertson. I believe that Ted Robertson served the YMCA extremely well. In closing, I say, `God bless your good deeds, Ted Robertson'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate myself with the motion. Ted Robertson and I were elected to the Senate in 1975. At that election there were only six new Australian Labor Party members of parliament: two from the House of Representatives and four from the Senate. Senator Colston and I are now the only two members of the Senate who came in here with Ted Robertson in that 1975 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ted and I worked closely together, particularly when he was the Whip, because I was his Deputy Whip from November 1980 through to February 1983. He was an excellent Whip. I used to refer to him as the `sergeant major' because of his disciplinary approach, but I think it was needed, particularly in opposition. He was an excellent Temporary Chairman of Committees, and I think he would have made a very good President of the Senate. We both enjoyed a very memorable visit to India on a parliamentary delegation led by Sir Magnus Cormack. He also did a first-class job in the observer team that went to Zimbabwe's independent elections. He also went on a parliamentary delegation in 1984 to Indo-China. I mention that because as a result of that delegation he suffered ill-health and it is my belief that he never really recovered from the illness he received on that delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was privileged to stay at his home in Darwin on more than one occasion and also to attend Party functions he ran there. He was a very good mate; I will miss him. To Audrey, to his daughter, Lucy-Anne, who is actually in the President's gallery today, and to the rest of his family, I extend my sincere sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would very much like to be associated with the condolence motion for Ted Robertson. Ted's good friend and mine, former Senator Geoff McLaren, has asked that he too be associated with the motion. I am pleased to record Geoff's wish to pay his respects to his former colleague. Geoff thought highly of Ted and I am sure he will concur with remarks made about our mutual friend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I knew of Ted Robertson's involvement in the Australian Labor Party before I actually met him. Ted stood as Labor's candidate in the House of Representatives seat of the Northern Territory in 1969 and 1972. As an avid follower of the fortunes of our Party's representatives, I was interested in the results of his attempts to enter the House of Representatives. He would have made a fine member of the House of Representatives, but his bid to enter that chamber was not successful. In 1975, when the first Territory senators were elected, Ted stood for the Labor Party and subsequently entered the Senate. It was then that I met him personally and we became, and remained, firm friends. </PARA>
<PARA> As most of us remember, 1975 was a lean year for the Labor Party federally. In both Houses combined, as you, Mr President, mentioned, there were only six new Labor representatives following the 1975 election: two in the House of Representatives and four in the Senate. Four of us virtually replaced a former Labor senator or member of the House of Representatives and the two Territory senators were there because the Territories now had Senate representation. As you mentioned, Mr President, the six were you, Senator Ryan, as she then was, Senator Robertson and me, and the members of the House of Representatives were Tony Whitlam and Les McMahon. As you correctly said, only two of those remain-you and I. Initially there was a firm bond between all six and although the bond weakened as members left the Parliament, the individual friendships remained. The friendship I had with Ted certainly continued after he left the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted was a hard worker in the Senate, being a conscientious committee member, and he often entered debates not necessarily for his Northern Territory constituency but for wider national issues. He was, nevertheless, a valuable representative for the Territory but for the first seven years of his representation he had to work within the constraints of opposition. In 1980 Ted became Opposition Whip, defeating the then Opposition Whip, Senator George Georges, by lot after a caucus vote was tied. This event caused George Georges to remark ruefully that on the first occasion his name had been selected in a ballot he had lost. Under our Party rules, as with the Senate Standing Orders, the person whose name is selected by lot is eliminated from the ballot. As Whip, first in opposition and then in government, Ted performed with distinction. Occasionally his approach had a hint of his former occupation as a schoolmaster, but when that occurred it was not out of place. In private conversations I had with Ted, it was obvious that he was interested in promotion beyond the position of Whip. That, however, was not to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> As often happens, a great deal of the work we do in Canberra means little to those who preselect candidates to represent their party. I do not want to enter into a debate about Ted's loss of preselection, but much of his work in this chamber went unnoticed among those charged with the responsibility of choosing a candidate to represent the Northern Territory in the Senate. On the other hand, one minor blemish was blown out of all proportion. His preselection prospects were also adversely affected by the length of time he was forced to be away from the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I was aware that Ted was ill but I was still shocked to hear of his death, especially at the age of only 61. I was pleased that I was able to pay my respects to my friend at his funeral in Canberra. Several of Ted's former parliamentary and party colleagues were there. Mourners were reminded of Ted's extensive work for the community, both before, during and after his service in the Senate. Ted quietly and effectively carried out this work and thus much of it was unknown even to those close to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Of Ted's family, I knew only his wife, Audrey, and his daughter, Lucy-Anne. Lucy-Anne actually worked in my Parliament House office for a few months. Like you, Mr President, I am touched that Lucy-Anne is in the Senate gallery this afternoon. I did not have the opportunity to know Ted's two sons, Neil and Gavin. Nevertheless, I assure the whole family that the grief of their bereavement is shared by others who regarded their husband and father as a firm friend. As that grief passes, I shall have many memories of Ted which I shall cherish. I hope that the same will be the case for Ted's family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to this condolence motion for many reasons, one of which has not yet been mentioned, and that is, Ted and his wife, Audrey, spent the first half of their life, or thereabouts, in Western Australia. Indeed, it is just 40 years this month since I first met Ted Robertson when we were both contestants in the old Junior Farmers debating competition. At that time Ted was a teacher at the Mount Barker junior high school, as I think it was in those days, and in the next couple of years, in the early 1950s, he became one of the organisers of the Junior Farmers organisation in Western Australia. He also served for many years on the State Executive of the Western Australian Labor Party, although I did not know that at that stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we have already been told, Ted moved to the Northern Territory and ultimately became the Assistant Director of Education in the Territory. He also maintained, in a very active way, his pre-existing interest in the Australian Labor Party in a period when there were many fewer people in the Northern Territory and there was a very much more rudimentary Labor Party than the one which exists today. Ted was one of a very small group who, against odds and demoralising circumstances, which have already been mentioned, maintained a functioning Labor Party in that Territory for many years. My acquaintance with Ted was renewed when he was elected to the Senate in 1975 and maintained almost until the time of his death. I can genuinely say that we had a close and friendly relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last few years of his time in the Senate, Ted was one of those people-indeed he had done the same things before the Labor Party was in government-who were willing to defend in public the decisions and actions in which they believed, whether they were popular or not. Personally, I believe that if that example were followed by more people and more politicians Australia would be a better place than it is. I acknowledge, as others have done, the presence of his daughter, Lucy-Anne, in the gallery today. I extend to Ted's widow, Lucy-Anne and his sons, whom I do not know, the sympathy which I have for them in their mourning the premature death of their husband and father. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate myself with the condolence motion. I did not know that Ted had died until 21 January when the Senate was recalled for a two-day sitting. I got a great shock when somebody told me that Ted Robertson had died. I would have liked to have joined his family and colleagues in prayer for Ted at the funeral here and also at the memorial service in Darwin. Unfortunately, when colleagues leave this place one tends not to hear what they are doing. In many cases they are doing far more important things than we are doing. I lost touch with Ted. Being an Independent, I do not have the party connections and, therefore, probably did not find out what I should have known-that is, that he had passed on. I hope that somehow or another some structures can be put in place for us to be advised when former colleagues die.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ted was indeed a very hard worker. He was polite, courteous and thoughtful. I would like his wife and family to know that when Ted became Whip for the Australian Labor Party in late 1980 it was a very difficult period for me because I had been widowed earlier that year. I must say that he showed Christian charity and understanding to me during that time. I will never forget it. I would like to join with my colleagues in conveying my sympathy to Ted's family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many honourable senators will perhaps remember that Ted in his valedictory speech on 5 June 1987 said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . Whips always speak towards the end and are always told to be brief . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I shall be so today. When we learnt of Ted's death, we from the Whip's office immediately sent a message to Bernie Kilgariff because we knew of their closeness. Of course Bernie had already been told. However, he made a statement which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Ted and I formed a good personal relationship through speaking for the Northern Territory in Canberra and in our roles as the Senate Party Whips (alternatively in government and opposition). </PARA>
<PARA> Despite often very differing viewpoints I always found Ted Robertson to be a man of sound principles and family standards. He was a practising Christian who could manage to put his political views in a courteous manner and with integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>I got to know Ted, being Deputy Whip, and he was a capable, thoughtful man, as has been said. He was not easily ruffled. I can recall only a couple of occasions when he was and on both occasions it was thoroughly justified. It seems incredible that he should have died at the age of 61. It is much too young. He will certainly be missed by his family and those of us who were his friends. I recall several occasions when Ted and I would have chats. Senator Button referred to him as being a man of substance in more ways than one. Our little chats from time to time, perhaps over morning tea, concerned what each of us might do about being of some substance-certainly it was not easy. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted made a significant contribution to the life of Whips in that he was instrumental in having the closed circuit television systems introduced into the old Parliament House so that the Whips could see the chambers and know where people were without having to run in and out. That system pales into insignificance when one sees what we have in this building, but it was a great step forward at that time. He worked to see that the Parliament operated efficiently. I extend my sympathy to Mrs Robertson and to his family at his untimely death. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join with the expression of condolence on the death of Ted Robertson. I served with Ted in this place for some six years, but Ted was known to me even before I became a senator. Ted Robertson stood for the Northern Territory House of Representatives seat in both 1969 and 1972, as has been said already. He was unsuccessful on both occasions, but these elections had the effect of introducing Ted to many people within the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that time, before senators from the Territories were introduced, South Australian Labor senators acted as duty senators for the Northern Territory. Ted made a great impression on all who served in that capacity. He was a likeable gentleman who opened up his home to those visiting Labor senators and acted as host and provider. After he took up the difficult task of representing the Territory in this place, he was known to entertain all senators who travelled to Darwin on committee work, regardless of party affiliation. Some of the barbecues he put on in Darwin are still remembered with great fondness by those senators who partook of them. Above all, Ted was, and will be remembered as, a true gentleman and a generous host. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said of his official achievements and service in this chamber and on its associated committees, certainly enough for me not to wish to repeat any of it. I briefly refer to two elements of his career which are of particular interest to me. The first element is his contribution to the Labor Party in the Northern Territory. As I mentioned earlier, he ran for the seat of the Northern Territory in 1969 and 1972, was elected as the inaugural senator from the Territory in 1975 and served until 1987. But these achievements were simply the culmination of a long and illustrious career in the Labor Party organisations of two States. As has already been mentioned, Ted served on the State executive of the Party in Western Australia and then moved to the Northern Territory due to work commitments. He then served on the Northern Territory State executive, as well as holding Party positions as diverse as president of the Darwin branch of the ALP and Northern Territory representative on the ALP national executive. He is credited as being one of the driving forces behind the regeneration of the ALP in the Territory. I know that one of his proudest moments was being made a life member of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of his career that I briefly touch on was his obvious and abiding concern for the Aboriginal community. South Australian senators who travelled with Ted throughout the Territory often commented on his apparent popularity within the Aboriginal community. It is a sad fact of Northern Territory politics, as no doubt Senator Collins will attest, that too often the sad drum of racism is beaten for political purposes. The ALP has had a long and proud history of standing against that trend in the Territory and Ted Robertson certainly deserves some of the credit for that. Ted has always been regarded with much affection in my State and will no doubt be remembered and respected by all who came across him. My sincerest condolences go out to Audrey, his wife, and to his entire family. </PARA>

I do not need to repeat the record that has been so eloquently put by other senators in this place. People have told stories with some affection. They have also outlined some of Ted Robertson's record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I say is that Ted was known to me for a long period. In 1969, when I was an organiser for the Labor Party in Queensland, Ted was running around the country trying to get support for his standing as a candidate for the Australian Labor Party in the Northern Territory. It was then that I recognised the qualities that Ted possessed. He was very sincere, a real gentleman and a man who had a great feeling for other people within the community. Those special qualities of Ted's were shown very clearly to all honourable senators: those on the Government side-the Opposition when he first came in-and members of the present Opposition. Everyone recognises the fact that Ted was a true gentleman and that he was very sincere in the way in which he carried out his duties as Whip. From his personal involvement and discussions with other people it became evident that he was a person of special character. More than anything else, I remember that about Ted. </PARA>
<PARA> The community's loss will be outweighed only by his family's loss. I express my personal sorrow to his wife, Audrey, to his daughter, Lucy-Anne, who is in the gallery today, and to the rest of the family. All I can say is that I am very sorry that Ted has left us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share in the sadness expressed in the Senate at the death of Ted Robertson. I learned of Ted's death only when we returned for the two-day sitting last month. My first memory of Ted is when we met here in the Senate. I came after the 1977 election-the election after Ted's election to this place. We were immediately thrown together in the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. I thoroughly enjoyed our exchanges, as I have those with other senators in the chamber such as Senator Colston and, at that time, Senator Button, Senator Ryan and the then Chairman of the Committee, Senator Davidson, who is visiting Canberra today, it being the opening of the parliamentary sitting year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ted had a very real understanding of education issues and contributed very diligently to this aspect of the committee work of the Senate. I also highlight his contribution to education by recalling that, when we first met, my wife, Kathy, immediately became enthusiastic because Ted had taught her when she attended Albany High School-about 30 years ago, I understand. She already had the highest respect for Ted as a teacher. My wife is now a teacher. It was the example of her own teachers that no doubt led her to that profession. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to be associated with this condolence motion. Like Senator Teague, I first entered the Senate as a result of the 1977 election. Once again, my first experience with Ted Robertson was as a member of a Senate committee, in that case the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which was inquiring into the aluminium industry. As we travelled around Australia he was my mentor. He initiated me into the mysteries of Senate committees. I believe that all of us who come into the Senate look to somebody from whom we can receive advice and direction as to the way in which Senate committees should operate and indications as to how they really do operate and how one, as a politician, should try to negotiate a path between the two. Ted Robertson was a very good mentor in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My enduring impression of him in the chamber is of a fundamentally shy man, a self-effacing man, whose speeches were always very earnest and well considered. There was never any ill-tempered intervention from Ted in debates in the chamber. I believe that this gentlemanly and courteous manner was displayed in other areas of his activity as a senator. That did not mean, of course, that, when one visited Darwin, Ted and Audrey were not the most hospitable people who opened their home to visiting senators of all parties so that we might enjoy their hospitality in his capital city. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague mentioned Ted's deep involvement in education issues both as a teacher and as an administrator. I believe that he had a passionate concern for literacy and for the formation of young people in general, outside the formal education system. That is why, given his life long interest in the Young Men's Christian Association, he was able, after he left this chamber, to perform a very distinguished national service on behalf of that organisation based here in Canberra so that he retained his ability to perform an Australia-wide role on behalf of future generations of young Australians. I know that he derived great satisfaction from that role. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Monday, 14 January 1991, of the Honourable Gordon Bryant, member of the House of Representatives for the division of Wills from 1955 to 1980, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1972 to 1973 and Minister for the Capital Territory from 1973 to 1975, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Gordon Bryant was born on 3 August 1914 at Lismore, Victoria, and educated at Frankston High School, Melbourne Teachers College and Melbourne University. Prior to entering Federal politics he was a secondary school teacher with the Victorian Education Department. He served with the Australian Army 46th Infantry Battalion and the Melbourne University Regiment, Citizen Military Forces (CMF) from 1934 to 1942. He retired from the CMF in 1961 with the rank of captain. </PARA>
<PARA> He was member for the seat of Wills from 1955 to 1980, and will long be remembered as a great carer of his constituency in that electorate. That was a time when the inner suburbs of Melbourne were struggling for a fair share of resources and he was very active in seeing that that happened. I noticed that at one stage the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that as a local member Gordon Bryant was a hard act to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Gordon Bryant was also a member of the Council of the National Library of Australia for a total of 12 years and President of the Aborigines Advancement League in Victoria from 1957 to 1974. Honourable senators will recall that he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1972 to 1973, when he became Minister for the Capital Territory. His particular concern covering Aboriginal rights was pursued throughout his life with energy and conviction. He was very concerned as to the rights and obligations of parliamentarians and even following his retirement from Parliament in 1980 he maintained his contact with the Parliament through his work as Secretary of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia. It is fair to say that Gordon Bryant was a very energetic and active person concerned for his electorate, concerned for Aboriginals, concerned for the Australian Labor Party, and concerned for the people of his State and of this country. He was very independently minded and active in all he stood for. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Labor Party I had a quite long association with Gordon Bryant. If there is one characteristic that I recall most about him it was his genial nature. He was a very genial, friendly man and a very outgoing person. I suppose it is unkind to say that he was also something of an irritant in terms of his diligence. After he left this Parliament he became associated with Latrobe University where he participated in seminars of academic staff. On a few occasions I was summoned as a Minister of the Government to account for the Government's failings to these groups of academics and Gordon Bryant always insisted that I attended. It was pretty tough going. He seemed to me to illustrate the gulf that exists between governments and academics. </PARA>
<PARA> He was extraordinarily enthusiastic. We all get youthful enthusiasms about things, but it is not left to many to retain them after they have retired. However, Gordon Bryant was one of them. I had a great personal regard for him as a warm and genial man who possessed the qualities of youthful enthusiasm. On behalf of the Government in the Senate, I tender our sympathy to his wife and two sons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Opposition senators I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in expressing our deep regret at the recent death of the Honourable Gordon Munro Bryant, E.D., at the age of 76. Before entering Parliament as the Labor member for the Victorian seat of Wills in 1955, Gordon Bryant was a primary and secondary school teacher. His distinguished military service during the Second World War has been mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Gordon Bryant was the member for Wills for 25 years, from 1955 to 1980, holding the seat through 10 successive elections. He was, as has been mentioned, parliamentary representative on the Council of the National Library for 12 or 13 years. I mention that specifically because from my own service on that council I know how important that contribution can be. </PARA>
<PARA> He had a longstanding and deep interest in Aboriginal affairs and much of his committee work related to that interest. In fact, he was a veteran campaigner for Aboriginal rights. He was a Minister during the Whitlam Government, and probably the pinnacle of his ministerial service was his period of service as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1972 to 1973. He was also Minister for the Capital Territory from 1973 to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bryant was truly what could be described as an old-style Labor man. In his maiden speech he stated that he would like to commence his parliamentary career by affirming his belief in Labor's socialist philosophy. He showed himself to be a strong advocate for the centralisation of powers and a strong advocate against the privatisation of national assets. He might be somewhat lonely if he were here today. He will be remembered as a man of principle and particularly as a believer in Aboriginal rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate the Australian Democrats with this motion of condolence. In doing so I note that Gordon Bryant was one of those parliamentarians who put in extremely long service in this Parliament. He was one of few members who put in as long a period as a quarter of a century. It was a period of long and distinguished service, particularly in his capacity as a Minister during the Whitlam Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Gordon Bryant is warmly remembered for his interest in Aboriginal affairs and for his vision of a political environment in which Aboriginal people could determine the direction of their own development. That interest was not just expressed in the parliamentary sphere, as has already been noted, given that he was President of the Aborigines Advancement League in Victoria from 1957 to 1964. He was loved and admired by many in the Aboriginal community. It is in respect of that work that he is probably best known to those of us who did not have the privilege of meeting him personally. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to discover that, amongst a good deal of committee service which has already been noted, he was a member of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, a committee which was dissolved in 1970. I would have been interested to have asked someone such as Gordon Bryant, who had been on that very early committee-and there will be those in this place who would know the answer-what he thought of what finally eventuated by way of a new and permanent Parliament House. I note that that Committee had an overseas delegation in 1968 on which the Hon. Gordon Bryant travelled. It is interesting to reflect on what aspects of this building might actually be here because of the work and the interest of Gordon Bryant all that long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the maiden speech made by Gordon Bryant in this place I was quite struck by the words of a fellow former schoolteacher on the matter of state schools. He expressed enormous dissatisfaction with the standard of state schools. In that speech, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We have all seen school grounds which are dusty, gravelly wastes, and class rooms that are drab. </PARA>
<PARA>Although there has been a great deal of advancement and development since that speech was made in 1956, I suspect that Gordon Bryant would not have died a satisfied man yet in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it behoves all of us to continue the work that Gordon Bryant thought so important, even from here in the Commonwealth Parliament, in the interests of our state school system. I believe that his advocacy for the state school system has not been particularly widely recognised, and I want to put on record my appreciation of that as a fellow advocate in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> As, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) has noted, he was one of those old style Labor politicians. Again, as Senator Hill has mentioned, he may have had some comments about the current situation there. I feel that it would have been good to have served in a parliament with someone like Gordon Bryant. His contribution was considerable. He survived 25 years in the other place, and for that, and that alone, he deserves enormous commendation. Of course, in substance he was a contributor, as we all want to be when we come to this place. On behalf of the Democrats, I am honoured to join in supporting this condolence motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator Boswell and my other colleagues in the National Party of Australia, I would like to join in this condolence motion in paying a tribute to Gordon Bryant. I was fortunate to know Gordon Bryant during the period that I was a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and, subsequently, in a number of personal capacities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Gordon Bryant was obviously a man who made a great contribution to this Parliament. Anybody who serves 25 years representing one electorate must bring to the Parliament a great wealth of not only personal experience, but also experience of that particular electorate. As we know, the seat was subsequently inherited by the present Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, and I am sure that Mr Hawke would also appreciate the great work that was done by Gordon Bryant. </PARA>
<PARA> Other senators have already mentioned the work of Gordon Bryant as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I can remember when he was initially appointed to that portfolio. On his visits to the Northern Territory he was occasionally dubbed, both in the press and generally, as the Minister with the cheque book, because he sought to achieve significant change in the area of Aboriginal affairs from 1972 to 1973, and the only way in which change could be effected was by very prompt action. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that, as a Minister, Gordon Bryant was often the bane of the lives of many paternalistic public servants in the Northern Territory at that time. They could not quite come to grips with this Minister who would walk into the Northern Territory, make instant decisions and insist on the cheques being written almost on the spot to achieve significant change. I know that those changes were significant. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Gordon Bryant was regarded with a great deal of affection by many Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Like the Prime Minister of the day, Gough Whitlam, Gordon Bryant had the distinction of being very silver haired. Of course, in many Aboriginal communities it is known that as one's hair goes grey there is often a degree of flourbagging-the phrase that is put to it. I do not know whether it brings wisdom, but it certainly brings a great deal of affection in many of the Aboriginal communities. I only hope that at the end of my term in this Parliament, I can achieve some of the affection that certainly Gordon Bryant brought to many parts of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall meeting Gordon Bryant in 1988 at the famous Barunga festival near the town of Katherine in the Northern Territory. He was back-as, indeed, he had come back many times-to visit Aboriginal people. He took me aside on that occasion and gave me some sound, solid advice that I will not share with the Parliament at this stage, but I can certainly say that I have heeded it, and I know that it is in the interests of Aboriginal people. He was always known, of course, as a man who was very forthright in his views and his opinions. Certainly, on behalf of the National Party, I share in the condolences to his family. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Gordon Bryant was a great hearted character in every respect. His instincts and sentiments were in the finest traditions of the Labor movement. His great commitment, not least to the electors of Wills, his boundless energy, and his enormous good humour will be very sadly missed by his friends and former colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His greatest achievement was, unquestionably, in retrospect, the role he played in the 1967 referendum in this country. I think it is fair to say that without his passion, his energy and his unrivalled rhetorical stamina, that referendum cause may well never have come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> I owe a particular personal debt to Gordon Bryant. It was he, when Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who plucked me from the relative obscurity then of the Melbourne University law school to work for him as a consultant on a number of aspects of Aboriginal affairs-not turtle farms, but other things. </PARA>
<PARA> One such matter was the beginning of formulating a response to the aspirations of the Aboriginal people for recognition of land rights. I remember tackling that issue in the particular urban Darwin context of the Kulaluk people that Senator Tambling will undoubtedly remember. They were early days. They were big and difficult issues of principle, as well as practically difficult issues, that we were grappling with, but I very much appreciated the opportunity to work with Gordon and his boundless exuberance in trying to move that along. </PARA>
<PARA> The other main area I was involved with him-he gave me the opportunity to work for him-was the establishment and consolidation of the network of Aboriginal legal services around Australia. I think anyone who has been following the course of Aboriginal affairs over the last generation of 20 years acknowledges the significance that the legal services have had in that particular cause. Gordon, unquestionably, made a great contribution to that, and that remains one of his numerous legacies. </PARA>
<PARA> From those early days with Gordon Bryant I moved on to the even headier environment of working for Lionel Murphy in Parliament on human rights issues, a path which led me steadily downhill into the Senate with the results that senators see today. I have a very personal affection for, and recollection of, Gordon for the way in which he helped me and gave me a start in public life, in many ways, in those early years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that in later years Gordon, who lived nearby me in Melbourne-in fact, in the same electorate-favoured me with quite a number of communications drawing attention to the monumental follies of the Labor Government, in general, and me as a Minister, in particular. But the ebullience and general good humour with which these various instances of wrong headedness were delivered saved him from earning my lasting indignation, although there were occasions, I have to concede, on which it was a rather close run thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very sorry that my absence overseas prevented me from being able to attend his funeral and pay my respects to his family and, in particular, to his splendid wife Pat who really was a marvellous asset for Gordon in every respect over the years. I am glad, at least, to have the opportunity to do so now. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, may I add my voice to the many good words that have been said about Gordon Bryant today. Like you, he had a background in teaching and turned it to most splendid use. Listening to Senator Gareth Evans, I am reminded of the sort of person Gordon Bryant was. He was a person who was strong in his pursuit of justice as he saw it. He strove mightily for what he thought was right and would tell people very directly what he did think, but always with a great kindness and generosity of spirit, which again has been reflected by the people who have spoken here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we were to apply to Gordon the golden rule that we should always do unto others as we would have them do unto us, he would pass with flying colours. That came out at his funeral service, which I attended and which was attended by people from the various parts of the life that he had so fruitfully lived. There were soldiers from the Second World War, looking a little unsteady on their feet but paying their tributes to him with dignity; people who were associated with him in his career as a teacher; and, of course, people from politics-politics in Canberra and the politics that he pursued at home, for example, at the State conferences which he attended and pressed forward his views in the most wonderful fashion. The people who have spoken here today have brought out his warmth of personality. All I want to do is to endorse everything that has already been said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to add briefly my words of condolence at the passing of Gordon Bryant. I do so for two particular reasons. The first is that I did know Gordon. We shared five years in the House of Representatives from 1975 to 1980. We both left the House of Representatives at the same time in 1980 for quite different reasons: he went voluntarily, whilst I did not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Involuntary retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Involuntary retirement. During that period I got to know Gordon well as a fellow Victorian representative in the Parliament. The second reason is that Gordon represented the seat of Wills for 25 years. That seat basically comprised the suburbs of Brunswick and Coburg in the inner city areas of Melbourne, and for the past five years my senatorial office has been in Brunswick. During that period I have got to know many of the people who knew Gordon Bryant when he was the member for that area. It is very encouraging, and perhaps remarkable, that so long after his retirement from politics he is still so widely and warmly remembered there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Gordon was a very distinguished man in many ways. His military career, which has been commented on, was a distinguished one. He served overseas during the Second World War in Borneo and Morotai. He rose to the rank of captain. He lost a lung as a result of his involvement in the Pacific campaigns, yet that never held him back from doing the things that he wanted to do in life. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button referred to Gordon as being a very genial person. That is a very good term. I would have added to that the word `amiable'. I think Gordon was a very amiable man. He was very courteous and he had a deep sense of integrity. At the same time, he was very outspoken and was very independent minded. He had a lifelong involvement with and passion for the cause of the betterment of the Aboriginal people of Australia. He was the Whitlam Government's first Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. One would have to say, looking back at that period as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, that whilst he brought a great deal of effort to that office it was probably a period which he would look back on with hindsight as one of the less satisfactory periods of his life because it was so marked with controversy and dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> To his everlasting credit, despite the controversy that surrounded him, for reasons that many people would say resulted from his inability to take decisions as decisively as one needs to in ministerial life, he fought for his cause in Aboriginal affairs, particularly after he lost the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs and his role was subjected to very careful scrutiny by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I remember that because I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee at the time. The dealings that the Committee had with Gordon Bryant in sorting through just what had happened in that very turbulent period were marked by a great deal of honesty and frankness on his part. At the end of it I think he came through as an enhanced person. </PARA>
<PARA> His parliamentary career as a whole was chequered. It is not generally known that in 1967 he was almost a contender for the leadership of the parliamentary Labor Party on the retirement of Arthur Calwell. That was at the time when Gough Whitlam was seeking to succeed Arthur Calwell. As I understand it, Gordon Bryant was a contender for the leadership but to avoid fragmentation in the Party he withdrew from the ballot before it occurred. That was when Gough Whitlam became leader of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974 it was strongly rumoured that Gordon Bryant would lose his position in the Ministry. By that stage he had become the Minister for the Capital Territory. He survived that, but the greatest survival he ever achieved was when he survived the enormous pressure that was put on him in 1976 to give up the seat of Wills and to retire before he wished to do so. He resisted that pressure, and that was a very good indication of the strength of his character. He resisted that pressure, as he said at the time, for a variety of reasons. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1975 Wills was the only seat where Labor voters, in significant numbers, did not desert the Labor Party. I have no intention of deserting them. </PARA>
<PARA>Gordon left the Parliament of his own accord in 1980. He left many friends. He left people who have remembered him with great affection since then. He was very active in his retirement. As Senator Evans said in his remarks, Gordon caused Ministers, not just of the present Government but of the Fraser years until 1983, a fair amount of curry by stirring them on issues that were of interest to him. </PARA>
<PARA> We have lost a very good friend, a person who was an admirable parliamentarian in every sense of the word. I join with other members of the Senate in expressing to his widow and his sons and their families, including his grandchildren, my deepest sympathy at his passing. </PARA>

<PARA> Fathers, according to the Laws of Australia, should have equal rights to their children, in both custody and access applications before the Family Court. Immediate amendments to the Family Law Act should be implemented for inclusion of parental rights as distinct from children's rights.

Access Orders from the Family Court should be implemented without delay and at no cost to the non-custodial parent, thus eliminating denial of access. We humbly urge Parliament to direct the Family Court by way of immediate legislation to jealously guard visitation rights and become more liberal with them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 February, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) gave a speech to the National Press Club on Australia and the Gulf war. In the course of his speech he observed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There will be international and domestic lessons to be learnt from this conflict.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>A major lesson for the future relates to the need to control and reduce the international arms trade. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Minister for his statement and would heartily endorse such a suggestion. Indeed, I have made such a call for several years since I took my place in the Senate in 1985. However, there is a clear contradiction between the Minister's observation and Australia's own record. In particular, I refer to the intention to host Australia's international defence equipment exhibition, AIDEX 91, in November this year, and the attempt to double our military exports following the recommendations of the 1986 Cooksey report and the new guidelines introduced in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to dwell at any length on the role of the global arms trade in leading to the carnage in the Middle East at the moment, because the media have at last discovered how the world armed Saddam Hussein. There have been first-class feature articles in the Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, the West Australian and other papers indicating the enormous international effort that went into making Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq the military threat that it is at the moment. Some 26 countries armed Iran and Iraq during the last decade and another four countries armed Iraq only. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was not one of the countries which sold arms during the war, but we were happy to resume arms sales there after the ceasefire. The proposed sale of spare parts for Iraqi Air Force trainer aircraft by Hawker de Havilland was justified by the Minister, despite the record of Saddam Hussein's regime on human rights which we have heard so much about since 2 August last year-but, of course, we did not hear too much about it in the preceding decade. Ironically, the main culprits who sold arms to Iraq are now all supporting military intervention in the Gulf and, indeed, are facing weapons they in effect provided themselves. That includes, unfortunately, the two Australian ships which are, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) said on television last night, literally in the front line and within range of the Exocet missiles supplied to Iraq by France by the company Aerospatiale, which was one of the exhibitors at the 1989 AIDEX here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The bulk of military hardware was provided by the Soviet Union, France and China, but the United States provided $1.5 billion worth of dual use technology as well as trade credits, and much of the money for arms sales was put up by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The justification was, of course, that the world tacitly supported Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980 because we feared the Islamic fundamentalist regime in Tehran even more than the regime in Baghdad. At the economic level, there was the lure of recycled petrodollars from one of the world's largest arms producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Third World arms dealers simply following the quest for dollars included Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Egypt, the Philippines, Ethiopia, North and South Korea, as well as South Africa. Their arguments to justify arms sales sound remarkably like the arguments used by our own Minister for Defence to justify Australia's arms sales, although I will accept his assertion that we do have some controls while most of these other countries have virtually none at all. Ironically, Brazil's arms industry is almost bankrupt as a result of the current arms embargo on Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Another irony is that the greatest threat to Australian ships in the Gulf comes, as I said, from the Exocet missiles sold by the French company Aerospatiale. This company occupied stand 105 in hall B at the AIDEX 89 arms bazaar in Canberra and actually advertised the various brands of Exocet missiles in the exhibition catalogue. The organisers of AIDEX 89 asserted that their exhibition was probably the most sophisticated display of defence high-tech equipment and services ever seen in the Southern Hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1989, a publicity brochure claimed that the overall success of AIDEX 89 would be judged by the number of exhibitors and the meaningful business they did. The Federal Government obviously shared this enthusiasm because it provided the Department of Defence with $59,000 to participate in AIDEX 89. I wonder how much the Department of Defence will be providing for AIDEX 91. Indirectly, other funds probably assisted organisations like Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in that 1989 exhibition. The organiser of AIDEX 91, the Sydney based trade fair company Desiko Pty Ltd, has asserted in its latest exhibition update:</PARA>
<PARA>The international success of the inaugural AIDEX in 1989 will mean not only a bigger show in 1991, but also a new and greater range of defence high technology industry exhibitors and their products and services.</PARA>
<PARA>It is putting out its glossy brochures with lots of nice pictures of the last one here in 1989 and there is a beautiful big picture of the Minister for Defence in the brochure. So obviously it is well supported by the Australian Government. The organiser and manager of AIDEX, Bob Day, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>What is of most significance is that these bigger national delegations will include many companies and organisations which have not previously exhibited in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are constantly expanding the range of our weapons exports in this method. I, for one, do not doubt this because the end of the Cold War in Europe has meant that many companies producing military equipment have been looking to other parts of the world to promote their sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence warned early on in his portfolio in May last year that detente in Europe could lead to more trade in sophisticated weapons at bargain basement prices in Asia and the Pacific, and he is right. One of the companies which has already booked space at AIDEX 91 is Rockwell International, one of the United States (US) Department of Defense top 100 military contractors. This company was largely responsible for the B1 bomber and running the contaminated United States nuclear weapons plutonium production facility at Rocky Flats in Colorado-now totally discredited but, of course, leaving the taxpayers with a huge clean-up bill. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the strategic management and international vice-president for Rockwell's electronic operations, Mr E.S. Washington, Australia is the springboard for Rockwell International's maritime penetration of the Asia-Pacific region. There are many Australians who are not too excited about that. He went on to say that he views the region as the predominant marketing area in the next five to 10 years. Another Rockwell vice-president, George T. Jones, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are transferring technology from the USA into Australia, bolstering its technology and capability. In turn, Rockwell is using Ship Subsystems Australia as a means of obtaining new maritime revenue for its ventures into the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the latest figures put out by the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the Middle East still takes the largest chunk of military exports, but the proportion has dropped significantly since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. This figure will now increase as a result of the current war if the United States goes ahead with providing Saudi Arabia with $22 billion worth of military equipment and then further sales to Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also attempts to give Egypt a large number of US army tanks that would otherwise be scrapped following conventional arms reduction agreements in Europe. Doubtless, the Soviets will also try to boost their flagging economy by selling off some of their old weapons as well. The new growth area for military sales, according to the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, are South East Asia and eastern Asia. In 1977, that area took 6 per cent of the world's arms sales but, by 1987, this figure had increased to 23 per cent, principally as a result of increased military equipment acquisitions by India and Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> Curiously, Australian companies were quickly into this new market. An Australian company, Redecon Australia Pty Ltd, in a joint consortium with the Dutch company Nedeco was awarded a contract in March 1989 to provide engineering consultative services for the development and design of the breakwater complex and for the master planning of the shoreside facilities of the Indian Navy's new major naval base complex 80 kilometres south of Goa. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, we learned that the Royal Australian Air Force was going to sell off 50 of its old Mirages. I commend those senators in the Liberal Party of Australia who spent much of last year harrying the Minister for Defence over the sale of these planes to Pakistan along with all the other bits and pieces. I do not propose to go into the details as they have been well documented, but I do note that the sale went ahead even as India and Pakistan were threatening to resume hostilities over Kashmir and, indeed, they might well again go to war over that area, which has been a disputed territory for more than 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point, I would like to consider the Minister's rationale for promoting the export of military equipment by Australia. His justifications seem to fall into three categories: firstly, that to pay for military imports you have to export; secondly, that it brings down the cost of domestic production; and, thirdly, that we have strict controls and we do not export much lethal equipment but rather primarily defensive equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> The first line is an interesting one because everyone else uses it, too. We hear a lot about offset agreements but they are all the rage in South East Asia which is an area in which we are in hot competition. South Korea, for example, has become a major arms exporter and is even now assembling sophisticated United States aircraft involving substantial offset agreements. Iraq did the same in the 1980s to build up a huge military industrial complex in the Tigris valley, much of it through utilising dual use technology, dummy end-user certificates and front companies like Matrix-Churchill, registered in Coventry, England. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Hayden was Minister for Foreign Affairs, he made an excellent speech at the United Nations special session on disarmament in June 1988. In it he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is also clear that arms exports should not be turned to as a way of solving domestic economic problems. Arms transfers must not become a new cash crop.</PARA>
<PARA>I have repeatedly asked Ministers for Defence since then how they reconcile current policy with Mr Hayden's statement. They have consistently refused to answer or to deal with the question. Likewise, I have asked how they reconcile the statement by the head of the World Bank, Barber Conable, with our policy on doubling military exports. Barber Conable said in September 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>Developing countries on one side, and suppliers and creditors on the other, must adapt to a world where budgets are tight. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to place military spending decisions on the same footing as other fiscal decisions, to examine possible trade-offs more systematically and to explore better ways to bring military spending into better balance with development of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In evaluating their military expenditure, governments should be realistic, but they also should remember the human consequences of these choices. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government is very realistic but until now it has never considered the human consequences of these choices. We simply get a lecture on the economics of military purchases, which brings us to the heart of the matter. As countries buy more sophisticated military hardware they are faced with a heavy bill. Submarines, aircraft carriers, sophisticated fighter planes, frigates and so on, cost billions of dollars. The FA18s cost this country around $5 billion although they were originally costed at around $2.43 billion in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The six new submarines are currently estimated to be costing us about $5.5 billion, depending whose figures are checked, but that sum will doubtless have substantially increased by the time they are all built. The Anzac class frigates come in a similar expensive category at $3.5 billion at current prices. The Minister for Defence has asked me in the past how we can pay for all this unless we try to offset such costs by exporting. I have spoken on a number of occasions about the need for this country to stop buying such unnecessary equipment, so that is one way of dealing with that question. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need FA18s, submarines, Anzac class frigates or spy bases like the one constructed near Geraldton for an unknown cost, as the Minister refuses to name the price tag. What we do need, like patrol boats and coastal patrol aircraft, we can build here. Many of these arguments apply to the second line of defence employed by the Minister. While I agree with his assertion that Australia is not as bad as some other countries, it is very hard to draw the line. We have seen this over the use that Iraq made of dual use technology supplied by the United States. Where in all this is the line between lethal and non-lethal equipment? Most military equipment is actually non-lethal but the military machine needs it just as much as the hardware that kills. The Minister did not think that the spare parts for the Iraqi trainer aircraft constituted lethal equipment but, with a man like Saddam Hussein, it is quite likely that trainer aircraft would be used to drop gas on his own people or foreign forces if it was deemed a military necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a question I asked the Minister on 22 August last year, Senator Robert Ray said that the Mirages sold to Pakistan were not of major military significance, in which case I suppose the old Pakistani planes sold to Bangladesh were of even less military significance. Planes like these may not be of much use against a high-tech air force like the United States air force, but they are pretty devastating if used to bomb defenceless civilians, and I would assert that the Minister's distinction is really quite meaningless, if not hypocritical. Of course we are not as bad as Brazil, Chile, France, the Soviet Union, China or South Africa when it comes to arms sales, but that is no justification for slipping in behind them to catch a few more crumbs from the table. </PARA>
<PARA> The people at the receiving end in any of the 30-odd wars being waged today are not going to be too worried about which countries supplied the weapons. As analysts have sometimes observed, there is no difference between a capitalist bomb and a communist bomb and a non-aligned bomb at the point of impact. The only people laughing will be the merchants of death who were in a very worried state a year or so ago following detente in Europe and the winding down of a number of other nasty wars around the globe, especially the Iran-Iraq war. Of course, another war has conveniently, from their point of view, emerged so they can make lots of money. Australia did have tighter guidelines before 1988, although the present Minister may deny this. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Opposition shares my concern about morale in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade because one of the reasons for loss of morale is the way in which the Department of Defence has taken an upper hand, particularly over the issue of military exports. This relates particularly to the 21-day fast tracking of licences to be granted, and the fact that issues are looked at in isolation-the foreign affairs side of the equation seems to have been missed out. I know that that has been a constant point of tension between the two departments. Obviously, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade lost out and the Department of Defence won that battle, so it has the major control. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt whether the Mirage sale would have gone through before 1988, or the proposed sale of aircraft spare parts to Iraq, as officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs know full well what the situation is like between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. They are also aware of Iraq's human rights record under Saddam Hussein and indeed his predecessors since the coup against the monarchy in 1958. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, then, what I am asking for is that we take up the Minister's proposal for greater control by suggesting that Australia, as a small exporter, follow up the lead taken by Czechoslovakia under the leadership of Vaclav Havel. Czechoslovakia was a leading arms exporter but after the change of government there President Havel announced that his country was getting out of the business. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about loss of jobs, of course, and the economic situation in Australia and I urge research into proposals for economic conversion. It would be desirable for Australia to trade its way out of economic recession and to reduce the balance of payments deficit, but not by trading in weapons. Socially useful export areas for Australia to promote could include: energy efficiency technology, like LPG conversions which we could perfect and export; alternative energy technology-for example, small scale water pumps which are in urgent need in developing countries; public transport systems, which are urgently needed; and research and development into rain forest products other than timber-for example, medicines. Let us become the clever country that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talks about by redeploying research and development funding away from military equipment to such areas as I have suggested which are urgently needed by the global community, a claim which can hardly be made by traders in death machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have belatedly learned, I hope, the lessons of the 1973 energy crisis which was also the result of a war in the Middle East. I mention the above options because although we may be about 85 per cent self-sufficient in oil, Australia is the world's fifth highest consumer of fossil fuels and the per capita use of petrol in our cities is more than double that of European cities. Another initiative for Australia to pursue would be the setting up of an international register of global arms transfers. This proposal has already come up before the United Nations over the last couple of years, particularly at the special session on disarmament. In Australia, we need to make public our record, which at present the Minister refuses to do allegedly for reasons of commercial secrecy and because it would be too time-consuming. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in the United States the Department of Commerce is having trouble tracing the export licences granted to United States companies which sold technology to Iraq during the last decade. So are the Germans who provided much of the wherewithal for Iraq's nuclear and chemical weapons capability. It is an argument that no longer holds water. This information must always be made public. There are already agreements to limit the spread of particularly dangerous and sophisticated weapons, like the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the United States-Soviet agreement to limit the spread of ballistic missiles. We need more such agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Countries like Australia and Czechoslovakia can actually take a lead, as small countries did with the international slave trade at the end of the eighteenth century, in cutting the international arms transfers. The Minister for Defence, in answer to a question I asked last year in Estimates, said that we sold only $238m worth of military equipment, which is less than the base line of $250m referred to by Robert Cooksey in his 1986 report. I note, too, that the Minister believes that this figure will increase in the current year, as he has referred to a figure of $300m. Obviously we are investing a lot of money in military technology but there are some doubts about how successful we will be and now, in the wake of the Gulf war, there are new considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Gulf war, the world is becoming increasingly aware of the dangers of encouraging the global arms trade. People are sickened by the consequences of the trade in weapons of death, although the coverage of the Gulf war has so far been severely sanitised. This is presumably to avoid the mistakes made during the Vietnam war. I commend the Minister for accepting that we will have to do something about further controls and reducing the international arms trade. I am glad to note that he is currently considering constructive measures by Australia to respond to this concern, as he stated in answer to Senator Coates's question earlier today. I am sure there will be considerable lobbying on the question of the arms trade in the months ahead. I hope that the Minister will act now in the two areas that I have outlined in the urgency motion this afternoon by following the example of the Governor-General, Mr Hayden, in 1986, when he was the Minister for Foreign Affairs and he cancelled PADEX 1986 in the International Year of Peace and also formally abandoned the goal of doubling Australia's military exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> Considering the statement of the Minister for Defence, in light of the Gulf War, that `a major lesson for the future relates to the need to control and reduce the international arms trade', the necessity for the Government to cancel Australia's International Defence Equipment Exhibition (AIDEX `91) scheduled to be held in Canberra in November this year, and to abolish its goal of doubling military exports from $250 million to $500 million a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For once we are debating an urgency motion that does have some urgency and relevance. Often that is not the case in this chamber. I was one of those who raised this as an issue over the last few weeks. One thing which is patently clear to anyone who looks at the current conflict in the Gulf is that Iraq is now a warfare state. It is probably the only country in the world where one could make the accusation, if you like, that it is a total warfare state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is not much point in thinking of past ideologies or past practices when we analyse how this came about. Quite clearly, it came about by that country devoting an inordinate amount of its resources to defence equipment of an offensive nature. Iraq is a country with 17 million people. It has a gross domestic product far smaller than Australia's, yet it has managed to purchase more than $50 billion worth of capital equipment over the last few years. Part of it was disguised to the rest of the world, I would suggest, by its paranoia about Iran and, therefore, ignored. When we look at that equipment, we see that a lot of it came from the Soviet Union-the MIG fighters, the surface to air missile (SAM) sites, the Scud missiles and the tanks-but not all of it came from just one client. </PARA>
<PARA> Many arms merchants beat their way to Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq to flog off equipment. Some of that was condoned and supported by government action; to some of it governments turned a blind eye and, especially in areas such as chemical warfare and the development of nuclear facilities, some governments clearly did not know the extent of the Iraqi technology. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen countries involved in conflict with Iraq being met by some of their own equipment. There are many examples of that. We can talk about the Exocet missile and we can talk about trying to get rid of planes out of bunkers built by the British. It would be a very foolish government of any country of the world that did not recognise that it helped create some of these problems. It does not mean that we automatically draw all the conclusions that Senator Vallentine has today. I do not concede all those; some I do, some I do not. </PARA>
<PARA> One must draw the conclusion that post-conflict, the world has to learn. I put to this chamber that there has been a learning pattern in the world. The world has taken action to try to limit chemical warfare and many countries have taken action to try to limit biological warfare, nuclear warfare and, more recently, missile technology. </PARA>
<PARA> On those four fronts, many countries have been active, a lot of agreements have been reached and a lot of progress has been made. We cannot argue that with conventional weapons. Many weapons have been sold willy-nilly to whoever was willing to put up his hand and put up the amount of money necessary to buy them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at Australia's record on this matter. I have said that I think we are reasonably well placed, post-Gulf, to be able to push for limitation of trade in conventional arms. I do not say that it is elimination, and I will come to that point later. Let us consider Australia's track record in regard to selling arms. Over the last few years most people in this chamber have come up with one or two examples. That is all they can come up with. One never eventuated and another has been a matter of controversy in this chamber since I first took over the portfolio. They cannot point to any others. Over the last decade we have hardly sold anything to the Middle East region, and certainly nothing significant. Our exports tend to concentrate on areas such as New Zealand, which buys the Steyr rifles from us, the United States, Great Britain or elsewhere. We do not have a history of exporting arms into regions which would increase the existing instability or make war more likely. We do not have a history of exporting weapons that can be used in countries that have gross human rights abuses. </PARA>
<PARA> Some care has been taken to filter through all applications for arms sales in this country. People refer to 1988 as the watershed. It was not so much that the guidelines were tightened; the procedures were changed in terms of response time. Other people have made reference to the fact that the formal committee does not meet every week. Like a sensible committee, it has various categories that it can deal with over the phone and decide one way or another, although any rejection ultimately comes to me for a decision. I believe that Australia has not sought to get into that sort of niche market of exporting lethal weapons that would increase the likelihood of conflict in this world. There is still a place for arms procurement and for countries to defend themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine comes in here today and criticises this Government's decision on frigates and submarines, as well as the previous Government's decision-an excellent one, I might add-on Hornets and F18s. That is her world view, and that is the sort of view that she can argue as much as she likes. I have a different world view. I believe that by spending a mere 2.3 per cent of our gross domestic product on defence we are laying the preconditions for a potential defence of this country. I do not identify any potential enemies at this stage, but we need a certain level of capability, otherwise we cannot respond. I remind the Senate that many people argued for unilateral disarmament in the 1930s, some in my own Party argued very strongly for it. That proved catastrophic to this country. It meant that we were left with a very low military base, and once threatened-we did have realistic threats-we found it very difficult to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no problem at all in justifying Australia's current military expenditures. In eight years we have gone from a position of spending 80 per cent of our capital equipment budget overseas to spending 80 per cent within this country. I think that is a great achievement. When it comes to the export of arms, there are several reasons why a government may be inclined to encourage it, provided-and I have to make this proviso-there are proper controls and these arms do not go into regions that would use them for human rights abuses or aggression upon a neighbour. There are economies of scale to be achieved. I am not bringing forward the argument of jobs here today, but I wonder how many taxpayers want to pay more for defence equipment simply because we try to produce everything ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the question of where we go in the future, I have made it very clear, and I have had discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), that we stand ready to look at the current guidelines and the current procedures in view of events that have occurred around the world. If necessary, we will change them. If we are open to criticism for not doing what we can to produce peace throughout the world, we will not hesitate to change them. On the other hand, we will not just panic and say that we will not sell any arms overseas simply because people point to the worst example of that, and that is not analogous to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not support the motion moved by Senator Vallentine today. It is based on one false premise to begin with; that is, it is not within our capacities to cancel the Australian International Defence Export Exhibition-AIDEX 91. That is a privately run arms exhibition, most of which, incidentally, would be directed towards future purchases by Australia of items which are probably, but not exclusively, already in the pink book. So it is not a Government-run exhibition. I notice that Senator Vallentine really did stress this point. She said that in 1986 Mr Hayden cancelled AIDEX or the Pacific Area Defence Equipment Exhibition (PADEX) 86. On 13 February 1986 in the House of Representatives, Mr Hayden stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) accused me of closing down the PADEX armaments exhibition which was to be held in Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Government took no such action at all. Private organisations which wish to conduct such exhibitions are entitled to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I am saying is that on this occasion it is not true that Mr Hayden cancelled it. He did not; he is on the public record in the House of Representatives as responding to that. It may well be, however, that actions by the Government that year-I think 1986 was the year of disarmament-could have contributed towards that decision, but it was not a case of a Government order. The exhibition to be held in 1991 has very little Government involvement. I said at Question Time today-Senator Vallentine was probably writing out her speech to read it here today-that I would look at that area of the two areas we are involved in. I am not making a prejudgment on it; I will look at it objectively to see whether it is a justifiable thing for us to be involved in and whether it would be consistent with our current tight guidelines for us continue in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the motion really misses the point I have been trying to make: it does not matter whether one is selling $250m-worth or $500m-worth of defence equipment. The whole point is who one sells it to and what the equipment is. The dollars that are put in here are absolutely irrelevant as far as I am concerned. It may be more justifiable to export $500m of product to New Zealand and a couple of other close allies than to export $100m into the wrong region of the world. Therefore, I regard the way this motion is framed as a bit of nonsense. I think it would have been better in the more general area. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of exports of defence equipment will be closely looked at by this Government, by me and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The rather pathetic assertion that has been made in here today-that poor old Foreign Affairs has been rolled over by Defence-is just arrant nonsense. If necessary, that will occur, but it has not occurred historically. That department has been fully involved in the decision-making on all these applications and in the eventual grant for an export licence. It has been fully involved and there is good cooperation between the two departments and the other departments involved in this, including the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It is not a case of big bully boy Defence rolling over the noble Foreign Affairs Department. I am sorry, but that is just a rewriting and a creative bit of writing not reflected in fact. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the history of Australia in this particular area, as I said, we do not come with completely clean hands, but, by gee, how do we compare with other countries? Their attitude has been, `Export or perish. What do you want-another 20 Exocets? Here we are; take them. Don't worry if they come back and take out one of your frigates six weeks later'. We have never had that attitude. I am talking about this Government. As far as I can look back at the historical record, the coalition Government never had that sort of record; it was also fairly stringent in its control of defence exports. I notice the coalition is going to look at the issue and I presume that it will come up with a similar policy as that followed in its previous practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not support this motion. It is based on a false premise. AIDEX 91 is a private concern; it is not within the power of the Government to cancel it. The reference to the doubling of military exports completely misses the point. The point and the danger with exports is when they are of a particularly lethal type going to a region of instability that will in fact create conflict. There is still a valid case for Australia to export to countries simply seeking defence self-reliance, where many countries, including New Zealand, rely on that assistance. It may well be-and Senator Vallentine may have referred to this-that government-to-government agreement to produce a particular item is a much better way of going than a private company going to another overseas company or government. I am quite willing to look at that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not picked up all the points made by Senator Vallentine, but her final point was in respect of the United Nations and that there should be a list. That is not really a matter for me; it is more a matter for the Foreign Minister, and I will draw it to his attention. That may well be one of the ways the world should go. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat that this is not the only lesson to be learnt from the Gulf but it is one of current debate. There will be many others and we will come back to those at another time. One must learn from what has happened. There is no use in putting one's head in the sand and saying, `Iraq was not financed by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others; Iraq was not given defence equipment of a very offensive nature; Iraq did not have very sophisticated technology transferred by western European countries'. All that occurred and we cannot ignore that. We must learn the lesson of it. It does not mean that every other proposition about defence put by Senator Vallentine, the Australian Democrats or anyone else in the past 10 years is also automatically true. There are other lessons to be learnt from this conflict. One is that appeasement never works; another is that one must be consistent. I am sure that people are asking that I be consistent in terms of exports; I equally ask the Senator Vallentines of this world next time Kuwait is invaded to get outside the Iraqi Embassy--</PARA>

We will suffer some slight humiliation in admitting that maybe some of our past export practice has been wrong, but everyone has to learn lessons from the Gulf-not just the governments but also the critics. As many times as the Government may have been wrong, the critics have been equally as often wrong. Everyone wants to learn the lessons of this Gulf conflict to make sure we can help prevent a likely repeat in the future. I cannot say I am positively confident that all the lessons will be learnt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vallentine has brought forward as a matter of urgency the question of the export of defence materiel or arms exports-however one likes to call it-by Australia. Before I actually saw the details of her urgency motion, I heard that Senator Vallentine was bringing forward such a motion today and assumed it would be in somewhat general terms, calling upon this Parliament to oppose the export of defence materiel. In fact, that is the line which she used when she spoke to her motion today. I think this debate would proceed along more sensible lines if that were the subject we were debating here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, before I move into that area, I want to refer to the actual terms of Senator Vallentine's motion, which is of a much more limited character than that, because she is simply calling upon the Government to cancel Australia's AIDEX-that is, the International Defence Equipment Exhibition scheduled for later this year-and for the Government to abolish its goal of doubling military exports, as she calls them, from roughly $250m to $500m a year. However, lest anyone misunderstand the matter, and Senator Vallentine apparently hoped that she would entice some support for a more limited proposal to the Senate than the one which is really dear to her heart and the one to which she really spoke in her argument in support of her motion, I wish to say that the Opposition is opposed to the proposal, even in the more limited terms of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, who has just spoken, has given satisfactory reasons as far as we are concerned in relation to both these matters. Clearly, it is not a matter for the Government anyway to cancel an exhibition, but it would in our view be foolish for the Government to try to lean on this body to stop this exhibition taking place. Obviously, if we are permitting trade to occur in this materiel, suitable exhibitions from time to time are part and parcel of that. Although some people-rightly or wrongly-may believe that it was unsuitable to have such an exhibition in the International Year of Peace, 1986, there seems to be no particular reason why the exhibition should be stopped this year. In any event, it is not for the Opposition to determine whether to stop it. The Government has said it will look at it, but in our view it is an appropriate event to occur in the light of Australian Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand Senator Vallentine complaining only about the Government's goal of doubling exports. When all is said and done, if she is concerned about the doubling of exports-they are already worth $250m-I would have thought a figure such as that would have really horrified her. This is only a smokescreen. The reality of Senator Vallentine's proposition is that there should not be any exports of this type at all. There are some very sensible reasons, which I will come to in a minute, why the Government should, in fact, be encouraging the Australian defence industry. If we are going to do that, obviously it is important for that industry to be able to increase its production and sales-as it is for any other industry which is going to be viable. It is going to want some goal: that is all part and parcel of this or any other industry. It seems to me that quite an irrelevant consideration has been introduced into this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the real substance of today's debate-that is, Senator Vallentine's strong opposition to a defence industry at all or to defence exports. I notice that Senator Vallentine has been able to bring forward this matter of urgency today only because she is being supported by the Australian Democrats. We will hear from Senator Powell shortly. Clearly, the Democrats are of the same view as Senator Vallentine in relation to this matter. The Opposition's view is entirely different from the one which has been expounded by Senator Vallentine and, I imagine, the one which will be expounded by the Democrat speakers in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is as concerned as Senator Vallentine, the Democrats and the Government about the extent of the arms build-up around the world and the uninhibited trading in lethal weapons that has occurred in recent years, particularly the arsenal now held by Iraq. No doubt the world has learnt a lesson from the experience with Iraq. Clearly, the Opposition supports the Government in its efforts, and the efforts of our allies around the world, through the United Nations, to endeavour to achieve arms control-whether they be nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironical that Senator Vallentine and the Democrats have spent so much of their time in recent years expressing their strong opposition to, and deep feelings about, nuclear weapons and nuclear threats. In fact, it has turned out that modern conventional weapons may be almost as great-if not as great-a threat as the threat from nuclear weapons. The world will have to give at least the same attention to getting agreements on control of conventional weapons as it has to nuclear weapons. That sort of agreement is one which has already had some notable achievements, certainly in western Europe as a result of the ending of the Cold War. Last year some very notable steps were taken to seek to vastly reduce the level of conventional weapons in that part of the world. I am hopeful that the time is ripe for international agreements of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I would think that one of the great lessons to be learnt from the Cold War is the fact that purely unilateral disarmament by countries will not work. Had the Western world taken note of Senator Vallentine's view, or the Democrats' view, and unilaterally disarmed its nuclear weaponry, I do not believe for one moment that the Cold War would have ended as it did in 1990. It was simply the Western powers, and particularly the United States, meeting the threat of nuclear war-which was evident in the policies of the Soviet Union-with greater and better weaponry and a greater capacity to produce and maintain it that the Cold War was ultimately ended. Forgetting Iraq for a moment, since the end of the Cold War we have seen the opportunities for peace in the world because the threat of nuclear holocaust by Soviet aggression was met and seen off by the resolute stance of the Western allies. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that we need an adequate defence force. There will be a lot of debate between ourselves and the Government about the extent of that. But that is not today's issue. Today's issue is the more fundamental one as to whether we will maintain an adequate defence force in this community and, indeed, whether we will support our friends and allies around the world who want to maintain, for defensive purposes, adequate military forces. These two issues are bound up, of course, with the need to produce and to trade in defence materiel. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what this debate is all about. Do we believe in having adequate defence for our own security? Do we believe in assisting our allies who themselves are only interested in defence, not aggression? That is the basis on which we pursue a defence policy. That is why we believe in the need for Australia to be able to get a reasonable degree of self-sufficiency in the production of defence materiel. The Opposition has applauded the policy of the Government in expanding Australia's defence industry-or attempting to do so. In order to maintain that industry and to help it to grow, it needs to be able to have a greater market than the Australian Government can provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I had the opportunity of seeing some major new Australian industrial developments-the frigate project and the submarine project. Both of those big projects have limited lives as far as industry is concerned. Industry has to look beyond its current contracts which they have-large and small as Senator Vallentine has pointed them out to be. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to get industry to do this job in Australia it has to have long term security. It is not just a matter of Australia exporting arms to pay for imports of such materiel. It is a matter of building up and having within Australia adequate defence industry and capacity to service Australia's defence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why we believe that fundamentally the Government is correct. We support it in that policy. We believe that the export of that defence materiel must be subject to strict controls. As Senator Vallentine has said, in some respects we are critical of the Government's administration of these guidelines. We are conducting our own review of the guidelines and the way that they are operating. Obviously there are failures in the Government's administration of the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray always tries to obscure the decision to sell aircraft parts to Iran by saying that the sale did not go ahead, but this decision was made by the Government under the guidelines. So the administration of those guidelines must be flawed if something like that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my purpose to debate the adequacy or otherwise of those guidelines. We, as an opposition, are saying that we would maintain a policy of building up an export industry in this materiel. We think it is vital for Australia's own defence that we do so. We believe that there should be trade exports to countries that are friendly and democratic allies who would purchase these exports for their own legitimate defence purposes and who would not in any way undermine Aus- tralia's strategic defence interests. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the fundamental issues presented by Senator Vallentine's motion. Much deeper considerations are involved in this than the superficial matters that Senator Vallentine has referred to. Her speech in support of her motion clearly indicates that her views are fundamentally different from those of the Opposition. We will oppose the motion. </PARA>

<PARA> We had hoped that the Opposition would support this motion as well as the Democrats' proposal for a Senate inquiry into Australia's military exports policy. If the Opposition fails to support the proposal for a Senate inquiry, as well as this motion, as Senator Durack outlined it would do, then of course the Opposition's sincerity in its stated opposition to the present system of arms exports will be in serious doubt. After listening to Senator Durack, I think that those doubts are even more serious. Indeed, I certainly hope that each Government member will vote according to his or her own conscience on this motion, given that it raises moral issues comparable to any others which might come before this chamber at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion addresses a crisis that we now have arising from a major initiative taken in 1988 by Kim Beazley, then the Defence Minister, when he liberalised the guidelines on arms exports. It is not the case that nothing was said by me, my Democrat colleagues or Senator Vallentine at that time. Nevertheless, the changes were greeted with almost universal praise and support from the business community, the union movement, the media and, at the time, the Opposition. As I said, it was left to a few to challenge the secrecy which would continue to shroud arms exports and to predict that the changes would leave this Government with blood on its hands, jeopardise Australia's security interests, tarnish our country's image as a disarmament advocate, and still fail to yield the forecast economic bonanza. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me no pleasure to say that we were right on each count. The liberalisation of Australia's arms exports guidelines has been a quagmire from which this Defence Minister, Senator Robert Ray, is now desperately trying to extricate the Government. But the export guidelines remain, as far as we can tell, essentially unchanged. This mess will be cleared up only by the intervention of democracy. A Senate inquiry such as I have proposed is an essential starting point. </PARA>
<PARA> The Beazley guidelines, as announced in 1987, were aimed at speeding export approvals by reducing the decision time but, we were reassured by Mr Beazley in a media release of 14 June 1988, the grounds for denying export approvals had been more tightly defined. Five such grounds were listed. Of these, only one-adherence to arms embargoes and international sanctions-has been observed. The other four have all been violated. An examination of each will prove my point. Senator Robert Ray, in his contribution, said that only one or two examples of inappropriate sales can be dredged up. I hope that he will take note of this examination that I am making of the violation of all but one of those guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Beazley claimed that there would be no exports to countries about which there were human rights concerns, such that some risk existed that equipment would be used against its citizens. Yet Senator Ray had, at the time of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, approved the export of spare parts for trainer aircraft to the Iraqi air force-the same air force which in 1988 dropped chemical weapons on Kurdish civilians, killing up to 5,000 of them. Government officials have lamely tried to argue that the trainer aircraft themselves are non- lethal. But David Lague of the Australian Financial Review points out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this technical distinction is almost irrelevant when Iraq's overall military posture proved to be so deadly. </PARA>
<PARA> Trainers play a vital role in preparing pilots to fly lethal high-performance combat aircraft and the PC-9 can also be used as a highly effective ground attack aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Durack, in his contribution, laid great emphasis on the need to support allies. Well, at the time Iraq was an ally. It now appears that Iran could very well be an ally. Senator Durack also raised another issue: the long term security of our arms industry. How can anything be long term, let alone secure, in a world of sliding and slippy allegiances such as I have just pointed to?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has reported that Australian military sales to the United States of America in 1989-90 totalled $110m. I point out that this too is contributing to the violation of the rights of children, women and men in Kuwait and Iraq who have been killed, maimed, orphaned, widowed and left homeless probably-although we are yet to discover fully-in their tens of thousands under a relentless aerial bombardment campaign led by our major ally. </PARA>
<PARA> There is then the question of Somalia, to which approval was given in 1989-90 for the export of goods worth $4.87m. I have reason to believe that that request was subsequently withdrawn and that the export did not proceed. However, according to my information, this appears not to be the result of the stringency of the guidelines, but rather a commercial decision made by the exporter. As is well known, Somalia has been gripped by a civil war which recently resulted in the overthrow of former President Mohammed Siad Barre. Amnesty International's 1990 annual report accuses government forces of killing hundreds of unarmed civilians in attacks, reprisals and extrajudicial executions. Indonesia, the Philippines and Bangladesh also stand accused of serious human rights abuses, and all were significant buyers of Australian arms in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Another case in point is Bougainville, where Australian military equipment and training have contributed to human rights abuses by both the Papua New Guinea defence force and the Bougainville revolutionary army, including torture, ill- treatment and extrajudicial execution. After the abortive military campaign was terminated, Australian-made patrol boats were used to enforce a total embargo on supplies to Bougainville, which led to the collapse of health services and hundreds of innocent deaths. This embargo was also a gross violation of human rights. It went far beyond the terms of the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq, which exempt medical supplies and some foodstuffs on humanitarian grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at another guideline. Mr Beazley also insisted that export approvals would not be granted if they were to harm Australia's strategic interests. Yet we have just exported 36 Mirage fighters to Pakistan, which has a well documented nuclear weapons program and a simmering dispute with India. The Mirages could deliver nuclear weapons or provide air support for a nuclear strike by Pakistan's frontline F16 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> An Australian firm, Sinclair Knight and Partners (SKP), is the senior partner in a consortium which is planning a $2 billion west coast base for the Indian Navy. SKP's success in winning the contract was due in part to personal lobbying by Prime Minister Hawke, yet the new base at Goa will be a springboard for India's attempts to gain naval supremacy in the Indian Ocean. The Government would no doubt argue that planning a base is tame stuff compared to supplying warships, for instance. My response is that warships are no use without a base; it is no more moral to supply the bow than the arrow. It should be pointed out that the export guidelines do not cover military services such as naval base planning or training even though they can be as militarily significant as the actual hardware. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Beazley also claimed that exports would be disallowed where specific foreign policy interests outweighed the export benefits. Had this principle been adhered to, the Mirage deal, which is a running sore in our relationship with India, as the Minister has said, would never have gone ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from our relationship with individual countries, Australia has an overriding foreign policy interest which is being undermined by the arms export drive. The present Governor-General, Mr Bill Hayden, when Foreign Minister, along with his disarmament ambassador, issued many calls for a reduction in conventional weapons and the arms trade. Our credibility in lobbying for such measures is much lower now than it once was, yet the time is ripe now, as I am sure we all agree, for conventional arms control, as the world faces the fact that Iraq could not have become the threat it now is without the military assistance of numerous industrialised countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain, as it then was. </PARA>
<PARA> As long as we tout our wares without concern for principle and gleefully host obscene arms bazaars here in our national capital, such as AIDEX 91, we have no right to call on other countries to exhibit restraint in their military export policies. The scrapping of AIDEX would be an excellent step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The final ground on which export approvals would supposedly be denied under the Beazley guidelines was opposition to private traffic in arms. Yet the Federal Government allowed the international arms smuggler, Mohammed Kahan, to get away scot-free after an enormous arms cache containing submachine guns, automatic rifles, hand grenades, mortars and antitank mines was discovered in Sydney in May 1988 bound for Fiji. Last year, four Australians were arrested in Singapore for unlawful possession of automatic and semiautomatic pistols, rifles and shotguns. They had been given export approval by Australian Customs. Claims that an Australian company had mediated the sale of fighters from Chile to Iran in 1989 have since been denied, but not before Senator Robert Ray admitted that such activity does not contravene Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the new arms export guidelines have been a ghastly failure, of which I have been able to give more than one or two examples. While the Australian Democrats do not deny that some military exports can be legitimate-where they clearly contribute to the genuine defence of a nation and have no role in human rights violations or offensive military action-the strict implementation of these principles would see the number of export approvals fall dramatically. It is time for a drastic overhaul of the system and for a realisation of the difficulties in terms of international alliances, and the inability of any nation to be certain over the long term what the leadership in another nation might do with such equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past two weeks the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, has made a concerted attempt to prove that the guidelines have become more stringent. The only evidence, however, that he has provided to support his statement is that he claims to have rejected a $450m sale to a country in a region of tension. There is growing evidence-and I found nothing in Senator Robert Ray's answer to a question today to shed any further light on this issue-that this alleged application may never actually have been made. According to my sources, nobody in the defence industry appears to know anything about it. There are no reports from any foreign country that such a huge deal was being sought. I have to wonder whether the Minister has been fabricating a mirage, so to speak, of his own to be sold not to Pakistan this time but to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if there is some truth in his claim, it may well have been that the proposed sale was simply impractical because it would have set back the delivery of the product in question to the Australian Defence Force whose needs have become highlighted in recent months. Either way, I have little doubt that the Minister is making a virtue of necessity under pressure from those of us in the community who are questioning Australia's role in arms sales or making a virtue of nothing at all. Unless he reveals all the relevant details-and the attempt was made today by Senator Durack to get such a revelation-the public and my Senate colleagues could be forgiven for assuming that he is misleading us and hiding behind the plea of commercial confidentiality, as he did this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular incident is at the core of the problem we are debating. The secrecy surrounding the arms export guidelines is a root cause of the blunders that have been made. It is time for Parliament to intervene in the national interest. The Australian Democrats support this motion and call on the Opposition to back our proposal for a Senate inquiry as a matter of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The focus on the issue of arms sales is entirely appropriate, given the current circumstances in the Gulf with the conflict that is now raging. That conflict lends a sense of immediacy to the deliberations in the Senate this afternoon. But I suggest that beyond that what we need in an evaluation of the issue is a sense of urgency which will be required in the postwar world as we move to create a genuine new order in international affairs. As part of the process of recovery and reconstruction, not only in the Gulf and Middle East but on a global scale, the world requires a comprehensive international agreement to restrict, wherever possible, the trafficking and sale of arms. The fact that that traffic is being conducted on a global scale means that an international convention is required, a matter on which I shall say more later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The platform of the Australian Labor Party on the issue of arms sales is in two parts. First, in the section on defence the platform reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor will ensure exclusive government control over the manufacture and export of arms and munitions. Regulation should balance the economic and strategic interest, and Labor's support for the inherent right of all nations for self defence with our broad concerns for discouraging conflict and for support of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA>That section must be read in complementary terms with the section in the foreign affairs part of the platform which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor will support action in the United Nations and directly with other States to reduce the arms trade and to bring about reductions in military budgets. Control and, where appropriate, prohibit the provision or on-sale of Australian arms overseas if they are likely to be used in activity which the Australian Government considers undesir- able, such as abuse of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA>I would argue, without fear of contradiction, that the Labor Government has acted consistently with the terms and spirit of the Party platform in those two respects. That platform was arrived at relatively recently at the Hobart 1988 conference of our Party. It was arrived at after very careful consultation within the Party. I am pleased to say it was arrived at unanimously as to the manner in which the proposition was drafted, debated, and adopted. The platform has been applied rigorously in government and in its application the policy works and is seen to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has not entered the dimension of major arms suppliers, thankfully. Our total arms exports for last year approached some $160m only, compared with the billions of dollars-in some cases, the tens of billions of dollars-earned by the major arms suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the Australian arms exports have gone to our traditional friends and allies-to the United Kingdom, the United States (US) and New Zealand, countries with whom Australia has had very close defence ties over generations; with whom we have, or have had, treaty relationships that have been integral to our security; with whom, traditionally, we have traded in military technology; with whom we have exchanged intelligence and, I might add, with whom we have fought wars against aggressors on a number of occasions. As Senator Robert Ray said earlier-I think Senator Durack took up the point-in dealing with the issue it is a question of purposes, a question of objectives and, in trading with these countries, it is also a question of shared values. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion before the Senate that Senator Vallentine has moved today falls down because of basic inadequacies. The motion calls for unilateral action and it proposes no effective means of reducing the international arms trade. If Australia were to act unilaterally without consultation with other friendly powers, or outside the umbrella of the United Nations (UN), some other country-in all probability, far less scrupulous about arms trafficking than Australia-would simply pick up the trade. In other words, the motion before the Senate, if carried this afternoon, would achieve precisely nought. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to achieve reductions in international arms trafficking, then it must be achieved through an international framework. The organisation for accomplishing that goal-and it is a very desirable goal-is surely the United Nations, an organisation to which this Parliament is committed and to which all parties represented in this Parliament are committed. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me no joy at all to draw the attention of the Senate this afternoon to what unilateralism has actually brought over generations. Mention has been made of the 1930s earlier in the debate. We could also make mention of the fact that cries for unilateralism in the 1980s accomplished precisely nothing. Multilateralism achieves results through the United Nations or other organisations which bring countries together at the negotiating table. From time to time, bilateral negotiations can achieve highly desirable ends, as we have seen in Geneva between the superpowers. Unilateralism achieves nought. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while, sobering and, in some respects, disturbing to look at the recent history of global arms trade. It has been dominated by the superpowers of the post-war period-the United States and the Soviet Union, although whether or not we continue to refer to the Soviet Union as a superpower in the full sense of that terminology is open to question, but in terms of military capacity the Soviet Union remains a superpower. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither of the superpowers has been blameless with regard to arms trafficking with really difficult parts of the world. It is true that Iraq benefited from quite massive purchases of Soviet weapons and technology and from military advice from the USSR. Iraq benefited further from Western military technology, particularly from France, Britain and Germany. It is only very recently, with revelations in the United States and in Germany, that we have seen the full ramifications of awful German technical advice to Iraq. Iraq benefited also from US technology transfer and from assessments from the US intelligence community during the war with Iran. There were great mistakes made. </PARA>
<PARA> Just the other day the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade took evidence from a Colonel in the Australian Army who had experience as a peacekeeper in the immediate aftermath of the conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran. As Kim Beazley and Senator Robert Ray have said previously, Iraq can be described as nothing other than a warfare state. Its governmental apparatus, its bureaucracy, its political process, as well as its economic base and structure, are geared to war-to making war on neighbours; to aggression. It has no other objective. One anecdote may suffice to bring that message home to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances that really brought the message home to me related to the defences constructed by the Iraqi military on the border with Iran. Not since 1918 have we seen trench fortifications that go the length of a country-from the Turkish border to the Shatt al-Arab waterway-of extraordinary complexity and depth. They are truly staggering in their ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Saddam Hussein ought not to have been supported. He ought to have been shunned both for his cruelty and his aggression. There are lessons to be learned now, as we deal with the Gulf conflict, in terms of our relations with other powers in the region and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at arms sales for the last decade or so and at the list of trouble spots to which arms have been exported. According to a fine article by David Lague in the Australian Financial Review which has been cited before, some 22 wars may be said to have been stimulated and fuelled-to use Mr Lague's expression-by arms trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the list of countries that have been both recipients and exporters we see that it is a list of flashpoints. Not only Iraq and Iran, but also Vietnam, Afghanistan and Angola all figure prominently. So do Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel, Pakistan and India. North Korea, for example, exported some $3 billion worth of arms during the decade of the 1980s, while South Korea was a major recipient of US arms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the end of the Cold War presents great opportunities to curb arms trafficking for the future, but there are immediate dangers with the end of the Cold War through surplus weapons in both East and West. The United States and the Soviet Union require fewer arms themselves, and so their military industrial complexes will look elsewhere. It is worth quoting President Eisenhower again in his farewell address to the American people on 17 January 1961, in which he used and popularised the term `military industrial complex' virtually for the first time. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military- industrial complex. The potential disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. </PARA>
<PARA>Eisenhower's observations are as relevant today as when they were made three decades ago for both the military superpowers. Turning to the Australian experience, can we ask rhetorically: is it acceptable to import arms but not export them? Is this a matter of morality transfer? Or are we morally correct in acquiring arms that we need for our self-defence, yet wrong in exporting arms to other countries-particularly friendly powers-which require arms and technology, especially non lethal equipment, for their own legitimate purposes? I am referring, of course, to self- defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Defence Exports was established by the Labor Government in 1988. It works effectively to oversee policy on arms exports. It works on the basis of our international obligations. For example, there have been no exports to countries that have been embargoed by the UN. There are no exports to countries with unsatisfactory human rights records. There are no exports to countries which have acted in defiance of United Nations resolutions. Of course, the disposal of surplus equipment by the Australian Defence Force now also comes under the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Durack observed earlier, the guidelines are seen to work. We do need a new international agreement when this war comes to an end in the same way as the Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention set down principles and procedures on which humanity could order its international affairs. We do need a convention which will restrict and hopefully move us ultimately to ban the traffic in arms firstly to the trouble spots of the world and, ultimately by way of reduction, to eliminate the trade overall. We do need a new convention that applies with force firstly to the reduction of tension and ultimately to the elimination of trafficking in arms and military technology. The war over Kuwait gives us the opportunity to focus on that today. The motion before the Senate is woefully inadequate and ought to be rejected by all in the chamber. It cannot form the basis of a reasoned policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be opposing this motion. We will be opposing it quite simply because it is inaccurate and inappropriate. We in the Liberal and National parties have a long record of support for responsible arms control measures, and this motion completely misses the point about arms control and arms limitation. It misses it by such a mile that it is quite clear that not only has Senator Vallentine had a hand in writing it but also the Australian Democrats and the Democrats' staffers have had a hand in it. It is so inadequate and so incompetent, as the previous speaker, Senator Loosley, said. The motion says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Considering the statement of the Minister for Defence, in light of the Gulf War, that `a major lesson for the future relates to the need to control and reduce the international arms trade', the necessity for the Government to cancel Australia's International Defence Equipment Exhibition (AIDEX '91) scheduled to be held in Canberra in November this year, and to abolish its goal of doubling military exports from $250 million to $500 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA>First, it is not possible for the Government to cancel AIDEX because it is a private operation. The second point deals with the increase from $250m a year to $500m a year in Australia's exports. The implication of those two claims is that, first of all, there is something wrong with AIDEX. AIDEX is an advertising and promotion exercise for the Australian defence industries collectively. It has a role in informing other countries and potential buyers as to what Australia might be producing that is useful to them. We would hope that sales would ensue from it, but there is no guarantee that any sales would be made there at all. As Senator Durack says, if we have a defence industry and we have a policy of selling overseas, there is nothing wrong in having an exhibition within this country which puts on display what the Australian industries can produce. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point refers to the doubling of sales from $250m to $500m. The figure is quite irrelevant. The implication is that, by moving from $250m to $500m, somehow or other we are producing sales of $250m per year. That is not true. The sales last year, the fiscal year 1989-90, totalled $157m. We come to a little point of mischief. I have a copy of the Hansard record of the proceedings of Senate Estimates Committee B. I found that question was one of a series of questions asked by the good Senator Vallentine who, we had to comment earlier in the debate, has very little respect for accuracy or truth in her statements. In direct answer to one of her questions as to the value of exports, she was told that sales last year were $157m. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Vallentine looks at one of her favourite publications, the SIPRI year book on world armaments and disarmaments for 1990 put out by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute-that great bible of the lefties, the pacifists, the unilateral disarmers and people such as that-she will see that it lists 15 countries in order of their armaments sales around the world. Poor old Australia does not even make the 15. It is collected with the `others'. It is right off the list. Table after table in the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute year book never mentions Australia. We are lumped behind Egypt and 15 other countries in selling armaments. We are hardly in the big league. The figure of $157m, given the cost of armaments, really is peanuts. This country spends about $8 billion per year on defence. That is only 2.3 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP), which is far too low a figure. It is generally agreed that the base figure should be about 3 per cent of GDP. Let us just take the figure of $8 billion. As a fraction, the sales of $150m-odd is minuscule. However the point is that the actual figure of sales is quite irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> It is desirable for Australia to be making its own weapons and its own armaments because it gives us a degree of self-reliance. Furthermore, we have a major interest in promoting regional security. Australia does not live in peace by the strength of its own defence capabilities; it lives in peace because of peace and security within the region. One of the things that this Government has not got onto is the importance of promoting regional security in the part of the world in which Australia lives. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have regional peace and security, we have to work with the defence forces of our neighbours. While the Association of South East Asian Nations is not a military alliance in any sense at all, it is one of the biggest groupings in our region. If we are to work with those nations for peace and security in the region, we need interoperability. Our forces have to work with theirs. If we are to work in concert with the forces of neighbouring nations, we need common operating procedures and in turn it is desirable to have a degree of commonality in the equipment we have. It should be quite possible for Australia to produce some of the defence equipment for the countries in our region and in turn we could buy some from them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have another problem with Senator Vallentine's motion. I doubt its sincerity. All I have heard from Senator Vallentine in the time she has been in this chamber has been the doctrine of unilateral disarmament. In this motion Senator Vallentine is talking not about unilateral disarmament but about the advertising of the sale of armaments-quite a different thing. By implication it could probably be adduced that Senator Vallentine has nothing against the sale of armaments. Everyone in this chamber knows that that simply is not the case. Senator Vallentine is totally opposed to any arms trade whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The objection I have to the motion is that it misses the point. The crucial point here is what arms are sold, the nature of them and to whom they are sold. It is not possible to reduce an issue as complex as this to the simple slogans that the peace activists and the apologists for Iraq love to bring into this chamber as a substitute for debate. If it is desirable for Australia to have its own defence industry producing what weapons we can afford to produce within this country, it is quite legitimate for us to be selling those provided we exercise careful judgment in the nature of the weapons we sell and a careful judgment also of the governments to which we sell. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems we face is that most of the weapons we buy have been produced for the European theatre of operations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation arena. Often they are not appropriate in the high temperature, high humidity tropical settings that we want to use them in. Again, it gets back to the point that I referred to before of regional security. If we are to support our neighbours and set up a regional defence capability, there is a good argument to have our own endemic production of weapons and weapons systems here that is appropriate for our needs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the critical point is the nature of the weapons that we sell. Speakers against this motion have made the point that we have been quite responsible in this country about to whom we sell weapons. It is an extraordinarily difficult decision because there are enormous complexities. The previous speaker talked about the ready availability of arms. One of the sad facts of life, however much we do not like it, is that money buys anything in the armaments field. If a country has enough money, it can buy anything-probably up to and including nuclear weapons. The name of the game from an international relationships point of view is to try to control this very complex situation and that involves judgments being made about the nature of the weapons and the nature of the governments. It also requires a degree of forecasting the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone of us here has good hindsight in relation to what happened five or 10 years ago. It is very difficult for us as individuals or collectively as governments to make forecasts as to what might happen in the future. I come back to the point that it is to whom we sell and what we sell to them that are the critical things and they are not the points mentioned in this motion. When we look ahead and try to forecast what might happen to governments it is genuinely very difficult. In our own regional experience we have only got to go back 20 years to the 1960s when we were in a state of undeclared war with President Sukarno, who was then the President of Indonesia. He was replaced by President Suharto. We have enjoyed a very benign environment ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, one has only to look at the great change that has taken place in Europe with the collapse of the Cold War and the way the Warsaw Pact countries now no longer promote a threat to the Western liberal democratic nations. As a consequence of that we saw a few months ago the signing of the Conventional Forces Europe agreement which was absolutely revolutionary. The stage of reductions that the Warsaw Pact countries voluntarily entered into, the reductions that they are making in their armed forces and armaments was absolutely unforeseen three years ago and could not have been predicted. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a degree of restraint operating all the time in what this country has done with the sale of arms. This Government has introduced legislation to set up the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, COCOM, a committee for the investigation of sales. I do not think that is working very well. I am aware of instances where legitimate sales and proper sales were held up for such a period that it was quite uneconomic for the Australian industrial group involved to proceed with them. The bureaucratic procedures were so extended that they were simply not commercially viable. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the coin we have had the instance of the sale of Mirage fighters to Pakistan and, if Saddam Hussein had delayed the invasion of Kuwait by a week or so, we would have had the sale of the PC9 parts approved by this Government in the hands of the Iraqis. Clearly, the system in place at the present time is not working and has fundamental flaws but that does not mean to say that it cannot be made to work and in government we will make it work. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions have been raised in the debate about where Australian armaments are going. I think it was the Australian Democrats spokesman who made a song and dance about the huge sales to Indonesia in the last 12 months. The sales to Indonesia were $976,000 which is hardly a great amount when we are talking about buying missiles for $1m and upwards at a time. There was a comment about sales to the Philippines but the sales to the Philippines were $3.2m of which $2.2m went to United States armed forces in the Philippines. Only $1m went to the Philippines. The great body of the $157m in Australian armament sales last year went to the United States of America, where over $110m was sold, and nearly $6m went to the United Kingdom-both countries with which we are allied through treaty agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution to the problem is to develop our own rules and to develop international agreements. The Liberal Party was the signatory to and worked up the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which is one of the great treaties that exist in arms control at the present time. It stopped the explosion of nuclear weapons around the world. But there are other treaties that can come along. We have seen the Conventional Forces Europe treaty which came up in the recent past and 18 months before it we had the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty under which a whole class of ballistic missiles was removed from Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the way that we have to go. We have to carefully assess what arms can be sold to what country and we have to assess the nature of the governments. We do that by introducing treaties and having requirements on the sales and above it all we have the United Nations effectively operating to maintain peace and stability in the world. The great irony is that the purpose of this motion is allegedly to promote peace and stability but the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine are out debasing every authority the United Nations has by pulling down its efforts to introduce some peace and stability by putting a force into the Gulf region to liberate Kuwait. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the urgency motion moved by Senator Vallentine. It was only recently during the special sitting of this Parliament when we debated our involvement in the Gulf war that I spoke immediately after Senator Vallentine. I made some remarks about inconsistencies I found in her views about why we should not be involved in the Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have just come back from South Africa and Senator Vallentine will be pleased to know that some of the people in the world who take similar views to her about opposing the allied involvement in the Gulf in South Africa are the neo-nazis, the AWB. They support Saddam Hussein because he is opposing British and American imperialism in the Gulf. That is the sort of range of views that we find in the world from those people who justify Saddam Hussein or oppose the allied presence in the Gulf. I bring that to Senator Vallentine's attention because I know she has been a strong opponent of apartheid but the people who advocate apartheid in South Africa have exactly the same sorts of views as she does about the allied involvement in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not take seriously Senator Vallentine's motion concerning supposed arms sales from Australia, the need for Australia to end the export business and particularly the possibility of cancelling Australia's International Defence Equipment Exhibition later this year because in most of these areas it does not stand up to proper analysis. First of all, let us talk about Australia's weapons exports. It is a very modest program. We have very strict guidelines. Naturally, from time to time all guidelines can be found to have weaknesses; they can always be reviewed. I only wish that most other western countries had the same guidelines as Australia has on the export of weapons. I only wish the same guidelines applied to the Soviet Union, vis-a-vis the supply of weapons to Iraq, or to the French for their supply of weapons to the Middle East or to a number of other western European countries. As Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence, said, in the world today we are in the small league by comparison and have been very careful not to supply weapons to countries in areas of instability. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, Senator Vallentine and others have pointed out that we supposedly have been proposing to sell some weapons to Iraq. The evidence, of course, points out that they were very minor materials. They were not direct weapons and as soon as the United Nations (UN) embargo came on Iraq they were cancelled in accordance with that embargo. The guidelines make it very clear that we do not sell weapons to countries in contravention of UN resolutions, that are subject to UN embargoes. The guidelines say that we cannot sell weapons to Israel because it is in contravention of UN resolutions about the Middle East. I do not find Senator Vallentine giving the Government credit for that sort of guideline-that we refuse to sell weapons to Israel when quite clearly there would be a very profitable market for weapons in Israel or elsewhere in the Middle East. We do not sell weapons where countries are in contravention of the UN. </PARA>
<PARA> We have consistently followed UN resolutions. We have consistently been a proper player in the world community in following UN dictates and, of course, we have followed the UN dictates about our involvement in support of the allied effort of getting Kuwait liberated. When one looks at the list of our exports-the way that both Senator Vallentine and the Democrats have gone on in the past, one imagines that we have hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars of export sales-one is actually surprised at how modest it is compared with what other countries are supplying in their export of weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see Senator Vallentine criticising such countries as China, for example, which will basically sell a weapon to anyone, anywhere, at any time, no matter what the consequences. Most of our export sales go to two main markets: to New Zealand, which is our closest friendly country and with whom our relationship for 100 years or more cannot be doubted; and also to the United States. These are the two countries that are with us in the ANZUS alliance. In neither case can those weapons that have been sold be criticised. All the rest, in terms of the world's arms sales, are minuscule by comparison but, even so, many of them are being rejected because they do not meet the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> What really annoys me about Senator Vallentine and the Democrats with this sort of motion and the views they express is that they get up here consistently arguing that we should have what they call a totally independent foreign policy, a totally independent defence policy, and have no alliances or arrangements with any other country. Well, we cannot have a totally independent foreign policy and a totally independent defence policy without having a self-reliant and self-sufficient armaments and defence industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Hayden once said that it is no use arguing for an aggressive independent foreign policy with a pacifist defence policy. They just do not go together. If we want to have some influence in the world with an independent view, then we have got to have some independence in our defence forces and not rely on everybody else to provide those weapons. So this Labor Government since 1983 has made a major transformation of defence procurement policy in this country. When we came to office, as I understand the figures, only about 20 per cent of the procurement of defence weapons was from within Australia, with 80 per cent imported from overseas. However, with the major weapons programs that we have now developed-that is, building in Australia the submarines, the frigates, the Jindalee and so on-we now procure about 80 per cent of our weapons from within Australian industry. We are using the taxpayers' money to develop those industries in Australia to make sure that we do not exacerbate our balance of trade deficit and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot imagine why the Democrats and Senator Vallentine argue that that is not a good thing. If they were really fair dinkum about arguing for an independent foreign policy and always saying that we should not be in alliance with America, then they surely must have to argue for an independent self-reliant defence force. If one reads the material put out by Dr Martin, representing the association promoting the concept of armed neutrality for Australia, one sees that he makes no bones about the fact that we have to have an independent defence force which is properly armed and capable of defending Australia's sovereignty within our region. He does not go around saying, `Get rid of the defence industries'. He makes the point that we cannot have it both ways; that we cannot say, `Get out of all the alliances with America and the West' and then say, `We are not going to have any defence capacity in this country'. He knows that that is not sustainable with the Australian people. I only wish that the Democrats and Senator Vallentine would concede that point, as certainly Dr Martin makes the point--</PARA>

<PARA> I do not have any objection to having a large number of significant but high quality defence industries based in South Australia, because what they are now doing is using that kick-start they got from being involved in those programs to start to go into civilian application. More and more of them are saying, `Defence procurement has been the thing that has got us going but we want to get into the civilian area'. So they are now developing communications systems that can be used not just within the civilian area within Australia but also in export industries overseas, particularly in our own region. That is the sort of thing that Senator Coulter, as a South Australian senator, should applaud.

At the last election, we even had Senator Haines, the former Democrats' leader, running in the campaign at Kingston saying such things as, `The Anzac frigate program is unnecessary'. That is a program that will deliver probably 2,000 high quality jobs in South Australia and give us a base from which to expand our technological industries, and which will go on wider than just militarily. No wonder she lost the seat of Kingston, because in Kingston alone there were people going to be employed in that program-I think the initial estimate is that $40m worth of the Anzac frigate program will be spent in the Kingston electorate. The electors of Kingston woke up to the fraudulent view that the Democrats were putting-that it did not add up; that they could say at one level that they want an independent foreign policy and no alliance with America but they do not want to spend a cent or anything worth while on defence procurement in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that we have here today another example of the extraordinary stupidity of the Democrats and Senator Vallentine, who have almost similar views on these sorts of issues, arguing from a supposed moral view that all defence expenditures is evil and that it is morally incorrect. I have said it before and I will say it again: I resent greatly the Democrats and Senator Vallentine taking a view that they are the repository of all moral rectitude in this Parliament because they say that they are in favour of peace and against war and imply that the rest of us in this Parliament are in favour of war and are warmongers. </PARA>
<PARA> There are more people in the Australian Labor Party in this chamber who defend what we are doing on this policy of defence procurement-of modest export of defence weapons within strict guidelines-and who have had a longer and more consistent view than Senator Vallentine ever had of opposing war in the world. We realise that it is not an easy choice and that from time to time we have to have the wherewithal to defend ourselves. Unfortunately, we do not live in a world where everybody else is as reasonable and as nice as Senator Vallentine in saying that war is evil. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, this resolution is unnecessary, but I suppose that in another way at least we have had the opportunity to expose once again the fallacies of Senator Vallentine and the Democrats. I hope that this Senate will totally reject this motion. As a final comment, the Minister for Defence has indicated that both the issue itself and the Australian Government's involvement in the defence exhibit will be looked at. He certainly indicated that he hopes the world, particularly those Western countries and the Soviet Union that have provided all the equipment to Iraq, has learnt the lesson and maybe in the new post-Cold War world order under UN supervision we can get much more effective control over the sale of arms to those countries that do not respect democratic institutions in the way the people of Australia respect democratic institutions. I oppose the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For almost two hours we have been considering a matter of urgency introduced by Senator Vallentine that there is a necessity for the Government to cancel Australia's international defence equipment exhibition. That argument has not been sustained in this debate. All of the senators who have spoken bar two-the proposer, Senator Vallentine, and the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Powell-have rejected any such necessity. The second part of this urgency motion is a call to abolish the Government's goal to double military exports from $250m to $500m a year. That argument has not been sustained. Rather, we have heard the now too frequent subjectivisms from the Independent senator and from the Australian Democrats, as if they had some monopoly on morality or some monopoly on what is right and just in our international relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both Government and Opposition speakers alike have rejected the quasi-pacifism that Senator Vallentine has expressed, but not forthrightly, not frankly, because the terms of the urgency motion that she has brought before us today have not called for the abolition of the Defence Department, have not called for the abolition of Australia's defence responsibilities, but have actually only called for no longer seeking to double our military exports and no longer having an international defence equipment exhibition. These rather marginal aspects of Australia's defence exports are all that appear to be the concern of these quasi-pacifists. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to hear once and for all from Senator Vallentine and from the Australian Democrats where they actually stand not only about the Gulf, not only about defence exports, but also about the defence of Australia itself. Their credibility has been ripped to shreds in this debate today by the six speakers representing the Opposition and the Government. I find it easy to lose some patience when we have a repetition of a small minority point of view which is not compelling to the majority of senators in this place, nor would it be compelling in my view to the majority of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate that began with Senator Vallentine's speech had the innuendo that to provide for defence was somehow morally wrong; it had the innuendo that to export to meet the needs of countries in our region was somehow morally wrong, as if it was entirely wrong for Australia to export any items of defence equipment to meet the just, right and sound needs for defence of the people in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat an argument which is accepted by the Government and the Opposition that it is one of the first responsibilities of a country to provide for the defence of its own people and to be able to cooperate with its allies and with its neighbours in the region to ensure that there is defence against aggression, against evil. It is therefore a minority point of view that we heard beginning this debate which has not been at all compelling upon the Government and Opposition senators. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an assumption of unilateralism in the speech of the minority senators-that all would be well and peace would be gained if Australia unilaterally decided not to export defence equipment in this region. The Opposition and the Government reject unilateralism. We believe in disarmament. We believe in limiting the defence equipment of any nation but on the basis of there being disarmament which is mutual and verifiable and which deters any aggression against either this country or countries in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very strongly the view of the Opposition and of the Government that we should provide for peace through strength, peace through responsible acquisition of arms and of a trained defence force. What we find right for ourselves in Australia we accept as right for other countries in our region, especially our allies such as New Zealand with which we have close defence cooperation arrangements. It is entirely moral and it is entirely correct for us to ensure, where we can rightly meet the needs of an ally, that we enter into defence cooperation so that it has the defence equipment capacity to meet the needs of its own people. </PARA>
<PARA> Having joined with the great majority of those participating in this debate, and as the last speaker in the debate, I have no more to say about the failure of this urgency motion moved by Senator Vallentine. Rather, in the few minutes remaining to me, I wish to point to a need for a different kind of improvement in the way in which the Australian Government goes about our defence exports. What was the notorious case last year-1990-was the complete mistake, the complete error of Australia selling to Pakistan 50 Mirage aircraft that had been previously mothballed, that were no longer necessary for Australia's defence, and for that contract to have been concluded in March last year at a time when there was considerable tension and the possibility of an outbreak of war between India and Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that this was an irresponsible decision of the Australian Government not only because of the tension in the area but also because it was entirely counterproductive to Australia's interests in South Asia as it ended up alienating India, and the $36m payment from Pakistan for these aeroplanes has probably, in 1990, done us 10 times that amount of damage in our international trade. I am happy to see that that damage has now been limited and in fact ended and brought under control through the statements and undertakings that were made in December by the Australian Government, mostly in response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade about Australia-India relations. Whilst that is in hand and has been completed, we have a major lesson to learn from the failure of the Labor Government in the management of this exercise. It is entirely necessary-the Opposition when it comes to government will ensure it is achieved-that we make sure there is close liaison between the Defence Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In New Delhi on 2 August last year, Senator Gareth Evans, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, complained that the Department of Foreign Affairs had been `confronted with something of a fait accompli by the Defence Department'. He said also:</PARA>
<PARA>It was only after irrevocable commitments had finally been entered into in Islamabad that we became aware in Canberra that this actually happened. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans, when speaking before a parliamentary Estimates committee on 11 September last year, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We did not in fact know, as a foreign affairs department, because of a small breakdown in communications, that the contract was actually being brought to finality . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This Government still needs to be told in a debate about defence exports that that was a large breakdown in communications. It is totally inadmissible for such a foul-up to have occurred between two very responsible departments in an area where we are seeking to see Australia's relations improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the response of the Government to the reports of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. It is ironic in a sense that I still have in my drawer from the end of the last session the national capital plan, December 1990, as certified by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It was on the Notice Paper at the time but was not reached and I did not get an opportunity to speak on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I welcome the Government's response to the two reports which the Manager of Government Business (Senator Robert Ray) has now tabled in the Senate. It comes about as a result of the granting of self-government to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), which came into existence in 1989. Under that legislation it was required that plans be devised to determine which parts of the Territory were to be part of national capital plans and which, under the influence of the Commonwealth, were to be the responsibility of the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially a draft plan was put out for public comment and consultation and the Joint Committee embarked upon a review of that. We did not table that report until May 1990 as the tabling was interrupted by the election last year, during which time the second draft was put out, that report being the subject of the report tabled in August 1990, to which the Government has now also responded. It was necessary to extend the time within which the plan came into existence because it was clear to everybody involved that there was more work than initially had been seen to be the case. That is the plan which was certified and released by the Minister in December 1990 that I referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall not go in detail through all the recommendations made in both May and August last year. I wish to refer to just a couple of those responses. For the most part the recommendations of the Joint Committee have been accepted. A number of them have been accepted in principle; I am pleased to say that very few have been rejected. There is an acceptance in part of the third recommendation of the May report, which deals with the question of the timetable for the availability of the plan, and that is understandable. Some of those that are accepted in principle I would like to think were genuinely accepted in principle with a view to working actively towards their acceptance. I hope that that is what it means. I have no reason to suggest that it does not; I merely say that those accepted in principle will be monitored by me to see whether as time passes they work out to be just that. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 12 is one of the recommendations which have been rejected by the Government. It recommends that the area in Civic, Vernon Circle and City Hill; Acton, south of Parkes Way; Anzac Way; the precincts of the Australian War Memorial; and those areas of national land between Parkes Way and Constitution Avenue be designated areas but that the remainder of Civic, Acton and Reid proposed for designation should be subject only to special requirements. That has been rejected. I hope that in time there will be some modification of this because I believe that that seriously interferes with the role of the ACT Government in planning in the Civic area. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my view that the area south of Parkes Way clearly bordering onto the lake and its confines was part of the national capital plan, but that the other side of Constitution Avenue where the school of technical and further education is situated, while an area and roadway of considerable significance, also contained the Convention Centre, and building and space clearly in my view ought to be determined at least principally by the ACT Government. For that reason we felt that special requirements were adequate. I am disappointed at that rejection and similarly that the Committee's recommendation in relation to University Avenue and Ainslie Avenue has been rejected. As I said, I am hopeful that what will happen in those areas will be worked out between the two governments in a way that does not disadvantage the citizens of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation related to the procedures to be adopted. The Committee said that the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA) and the Territory Planning Authority should integrate the national capital plan and the Territory plan, and jointly develop a set of simplified procedures, including a one-stop office, for the administration of the plan and the approval of planning applications. It is said that this is accepted in principle and that the NCPA has prepared draft procedures and is discussing these with the Territory Planning Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot stress firmly enough how necessary it is for those trying to do business in Canberra to know exactly what the plan is, the way it operates and what they have to do. It is highly disruptive to have two separate plans, two separate authorities, and to have to go from one to the other. There have already been complaints from people about the difficulties in getting things approved and knowing exactly which authority will make a determination. As I say, the recommendation of the Committee has been accepted in principle. There needs to be an enormous amount of will to ensure that it operates so as not to economically disadvantage the ACT. There is a great need for this to be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> One of our other recommendations, which again has been accepted in principle, concerns the resolution of disputes between the National Capital Planning Authority, which really represents the Federal Government and the Interim Territory Planning Authority. I am sure we all hope that there will not be disputes between the two, but it seems to me-and it seemed to the Committee-that there were inadequate mechanisms in place to resolve this. The Commonwealth's response seems to indicate that there is no necessity for an appeal mechanism and that there is no need to appeal against an NCPA decision.</PARA>
<PARA> What we were talking about was the relationship between the two governments and how disputes or disagreements between them might be resolved. I do not believe that the response of the Commonwealth is adequate to deal with that. I would urge the Minister to have another look at it and enter upon discussions, hopefully to work out a mechanism before any such dispute arises. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of things in the first report-the Committee report of May 1990-which it would be nice to talk about, but they are apparent from the report and the acceptance which the Commonwealth has given to the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the report tabled in August 1990, there were five recommendations. I spoke at some length about them when I tabled the report as Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee. I welcome the acceptance of the recommendation relating to the Lanyon and Murrumbidgee corridors and the rural landscape that is encompassed within them. I regard them as very important. Eventually, Canberra has to stop being built and run into the mountains in a way that it cannot go any further, especially in the south. I regret in some ways that the housing construction has gone as far south as it has. But I welcome the acceptance of the recommendation relating to the area and its future. The second recommendation of the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence urgently consider ways of making as much land as possible occupied by the Belconnen and Bonshaw Naval Communications Stations available for housing development. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the things that makes this city an expensive place to live in is the fact that it is spread out. All of us are aware of that and would not want it to change significantly. But it means that the cost of the infrastructure is quite high. The question of infill is talked about frequently and people invariably urge infill. When we actually question them about which bits should be filled in, it is very difficult to get them to make a commitment. It always seems to be a bit that is further away from their place than the one we might be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there is much doubt that the naval areas I have referred to are areas which will be built on in time, and they ought to be. In fact, I suggest it should occur sooner rather than later, to keep the costs of the spreading city within reasonable bounds. There are some problems in relation to parts of Harman but it is not necessary to go into those tonight. The Government says that this recommendation is accepted in principle. The response states:</PARA>
<PARA> The draft Plan permits urban use of the Belconnen site and foreshadows further planning study of the Bonshaw site. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Defence requires both sites until a new communications station is built outside the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not help wondering how long it took it to work out that form of wording. This is well known and obvious, but the response somewhat neglects to use the word `urgently', which was the word used by the Joint Committee when it recommended that the Department of Defence urgently consider ways of making as much land as possible available. Is it not perhaps possible that some of it might be built on now and some later, after they have moved? I felt somewhat disappointed that the Government had not shown a greater sense of urgency in looking at this. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise, as does the Committee, that there is considerable expense involved in moving these two bases away from Canberra. I hope that they can still be located in Canberra and we will not lose the personnel that would otherwise be lost. There did not seem to me to be much real response from the Department in looking at the matter to see whether or not it can be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The other recommendations, which can be read by anybody who wishes to do so, of the August 1990 report have been accepted. Generally, I think the Committee would feel pleased that so many of the recommendations that it has made-not on its own whim but after hearing a considerable amount of evidence from people and organisations in Canberra which are vitally interested in the future development of the Territory under the new arrangement encompassing self-government-have been agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Forestry Council's summary of resolutions and recommendations is the report of its meeting in the middle of last year. I found the report particularly interesting because it recounts the conversations and papers which moved between the Federal Minister and the State Ministers who form the Forestry Council. </PARA>
<PARA> One finds in it a great deal of information which indicates quite clearly the lack of understanding by this Government-indeed by most governments in Australia-of the question of the appropriate conservation of Australia's very important natural resource in forests; the lack of understanding of what is really meant by sustainable development in relation to forests; and, of course, coming right across this, the term which is looming rather largely on the horizon-the anomalous idea of resource security, which really means temporary acquisition by some exploitative interests to the detriment of the long term security of all the other qualities which one finds in the forests. I refer to some of these as they give some indication of the attitudes. The document begins with a paper from the Hon. Alan Griffiths, the Federal Minister. It continues with a paper from the Hon. Mr West, MLA, the Minister in New South Wales. After pointing out that he is quite virginal when it comes to forests-a rather peculiar term-he says:</PARA>
<PARA>I must also say that the sharp right jab you gave to the greenies was appropriate and did not deserve the counter punches from Kelly and Richardson.</PARA>
<PARA>This indicates quite clearly the attitude of the New South Wales Minister about the way in which the Federal Minister was dealing with `greenies'. In his paper, the Hon. R. J. Pearce, the Minister in Western Australia, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australia is endeavouring to avoid the confrontation that has occurred in the eastern States. However, there are some elements in the community which will never accept that it is possible to achieve a balance, but a majority of conservationists are there to be convinced.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that the majority of conservationists are opposed to what this Federal forestry body comprising the Federal and State Ministers is attempting to do but that they are open to be convinced that the Ministers are right. I believe that the Federal Government is wrong and that the Forestry Council is wrong. There is abundant evidence in here that that is indeed the case. Indeed, the foreword of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Prime tasks of the Council are in the development of a coordinated approach to national forestry issues.</PARA>
<PARA>It then lists half a dozen points, and not one of them mentions sustainable development or sustainable management of the forests. This Government is on record as talking about the words `sustainable development', but clearly, through its organ dealing with forestry, it has no real commitment to or understanding of what it is on about. </PARA>
<PARA> A section deals with the so-called resource security. As I have said, this term clearly indicates that the Government does not understand the interaction of the use of one resource from the forest and the maintenance of all the other values of the forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, one point argues that it will protect a species only `where it can be guaranteed that native species will be threatened with extinction'. In other words, the Council is clearly putting the onus on the conservation groups in the community to establish that native species will be threatened with extinction rather than establishing itself that native species exist and may be threatened with extinction, and therefore taking appropriate protective action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always fascinating to follow Senator Coulter in a matter such as this and to hear how quaint his interpretations of English can be. He quoted the Western Australian Minister, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>However, there are some elements in the community which will never accept that it is possible to achieve a balance, but a majority of conservationists are there to be convinced. </PARA>
<PARA>By quoting that, Senator Coulter tried to indicate that the Minister was basically saying that the majority of conservationists was opposed to the development of forests. Quite the contrary, what this man is saying-and it is very clear from the English-is that the bulk of conservationists are not hidebound ideologues, as is Senator Coulter, and that they are prepared to listen to a reasonable debate. Anyone who is seeking consensus in this area is doing Australia the world of good. Anyone who is seeking not to develop a consensus and who is in fact hidebound by ideology and a lack of capacity to understand English, like Senator Coulter, is in fact damaging the prospects of getting a sensible resolution of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> As this summary of resolutions and recommendations states, these forest industries are of enormous economic and social value to Australia. They have an annual turnover of up to $8 billion. They have about the same economic significance as the wheat industry and they are slightly smaller than the wool industry. The forest industries provide direct employment for 86,000 people and are especially valuable in providing diversity and stability of employment in rural areas. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>That international trade is an important aspect of the Australian forest products industry. Australia imports roughly one-third of our timber and paper requirements . . . imports total $2B worth of timber and other forest products each year and forecasts suggest continued growth, justifying closer consideration of our future industry strategy. Substantial quantities of pulpwood in the form of woodchips are exported with lesser quantities of timber panels and pulp and paper products. </PARA>
<PARA>As the report indicates, the key point is that several studies have indicated that Australia could be competitive in international markets if it were to add value to pulpwood exports by further processing. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Pulpwood worth $70 per tonne as woodchips can potentially be manufactured into pulp, worth $800-900 per tonne, and later into paper worth $1,000 or more per tonne. Considerable interest also is being shown in prospects for manufacture and export of timber furniture.</PARA>
<PARA>I mention all this because there is a clear potential for this industry if only we did not have the Senator Coulters taking an ideologically entrenched position, which, quite frankly, is not doing the forests much good either. In the present system of forestry there is massive waste. If one is after sawing timber one leaves behind an immense amount of stuff which in many areas is burnt. There is a great capacity for an immense upgrading of this industry. That can take place only if there is some form of assurance that investment has the capacity to be rewarded by an ability to earn money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Forestry Council agreed that there is a need to maintain the momentum of the growth of private commercial forestry throughout Australia. Confidence and security must be provided for the future. Long term consistent support from all levels of government is needed. We have to ask: what long term consistent support is coming from this Government? Quite frankly, this Government has not been able to face up to this serious problem because of the divisions within it over providing some kind of rational program for the development of our forest industry while finding a sensible balance between development and preservation of the forest resources we have, which are basically renewable. The renewable ones should be the basis of an industry which, if it had the capacity-if dollars were invested in it, if there were a feeling of security in it-could be upgraded and would have its value increased. To a large extent, these products are being wasted. Certainly, while the Government dilly-dallies around, they will continue to be wasted. It is vital that the industry be given a fair go and that, for conservation purposes, there be a balanced development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Senate to part two of the summary of resolutions and recommendations of the Australian Forestry Council on pages 56, 57 and 58. This is really the guts of this report. It demonstrates and draws out the goals of the Australian Forestry Council. It provides a balance between protection of the forest for ecosystems, for public use and for sustainable development. It is worth quoting some parts of this report. I take exception to what Senator Coulter said about this report having no references to sustainable development; this part spells out quite clearly how we can use the forest and, at the same time, have sustainable development-and further development by planting additional forests elsewhere and by protecting the public use and the ecosystem use. The first point on page 56 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>sufficient area of native of forest is conserved with security of tenure and purpose to meet the long term needs of the Australian people for all forest uses and values;</PARA>
<PARA>a system of reserves, which is representative of all major forest ecosystems . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Part 2 outlines that strategies must be developed to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . management on a sustainable yield basis for all forest values and uses is achieved;</PARA>
<PARA> an adequate financial return to forest owners, and in the case of public forests,-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `public forests'-</PARA>
<PARA>the community, is achieved;</PARA>
<PARA>where forests are harvested, it is undertaken in a way which ensures minimum wastage and maximises the value obtained from the forest products . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those passages spell out clearly the goals in terms of balance between various uses. The document at the top of page 57 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . integration of forests with other land uses on agricultural and urban lands is carried out in a way that improves the overall sustainability of land use in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>protection of forest soils from erosion, compaction and nutrient depletion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting this document at length because I could not have put the matter better myself in terms of a way in which Australia can proceed in terms of forest management. </PARA>
<PARA> Also on page 57 of the document the point is made that the forest is regenerated after harvest. The passage in paragraph 4 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the harvest levels are sustainable in the long term on a regional basis;</PARA>
<PARA>with a view to maximising the value of forest resources, forest harvesting is confined to areas where it is compatible with other defined uses. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph on that page talks of encouragement in the planting of additional forests:</PARA>
<PARA>Where possible plantations are located on cleared agricultural land and integrated with existing rural land uses. </PARA>
<PARA>I make the point that last year in Western Australia alone 23 million trees were planted on private agricultural land in addition to the 12 million trees that were planted in the previous year. Obviously there is a great deal of such planting currently. Those who continually say that there is no policy development in respect of sustainable development and all aspects of forest management and forest use are totally misleading the Australian public. I find it sad that this approach is adopted. I believe that this report by the Australian Forestry Council lays down some precise and concise guidelines which are achievable and well worth working for. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to the Australian Wheat Board's annual report. I draw attention to the fact that the Wheat Board year runs from 1 October 1989 to 30 September 1990, which puts it in a different time frame from many other reports. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the present situation in respect of international marketing of primary products, I believe that we need to consider carefully the nature of the trade. The report points out that 10,664,000 tonnes of wheat were exported from a total production of 14,315,000 tonnes or over 70 per cent. In other words, Australia is totally in the hands of the export market. The price last year for the average of those sales worked out at $156.45 but, according to the report, at the end of the year the Wheat Board owed $1,427,041,000. That is, I think, the third highest amount that the organisation has ever owed. I do not wish to make any comparison with how the Australian Wheat Board stands in comparison with the Australian Wool Corporation, but these two major industries are heavily indebted. Certainly the world market is not what it was in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that although the report covered the period to 30 September, and although it probably would not have been written before December last, there is no mention of the fact that the marketplace was getting difficult. I believe that it is quite negligent of the Wheat Board not to have built its report around a very difficult marketing situation. The report mentions that Iraq had reached the stage of being the purchaser of 10 per cent of Australian wheat production, but no great concern has been expressed about the fact that we shall have to do something about it, or that there are other great problems afoot. The report mentions that:</PARA>
<PARA>World wheat prices fell significantly in the first half of 1990 . . . Prices are expected to remain depressed throughout the remainder of 1990 and into the early part of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>But that is all the report says in that regard. In view of the fact that we are supplying 37 countries and that one of our major customers is no longer buying 10 per cent of our wheat exports, I believe that attention should have been drawn to the fact that things would have to change this year. However, there is no message in this annual report that things need to change or that we cannot expect another good year. The report refers to `1989-90 at a glance' and under the heading `The international market' we see:</PARA>
<PARA>10.6 million tonnes of wheat exported to 37 countries. Low world wheat stocks continue to benefit world market. Sales maximised early in year to capitalise on best prices. </PARA>
<PARA>It is all optimism. I like optimists, and indeed I am one myself, but I think we must be realistic. I think that we are not doing wheat growers any service by not drawing their attention to the present difficult situation. The wheat industry is in a much more difficult situation than the wool industry because, unlike wool, wheat cannot be put aside for a while. In other respects this is a good annual report and I am pleased to have it. I hope that the wheat industry will be able to overcome its marketing difficulties in the year ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Australian Wheat Board on its annual report and the work it does in marketing wheat and trying to maximise the net returns to Australian wheat growers and minimise costs as far as practicable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened with interest to Senator Archer and his comments on the Wheat Board and its work. Two years ago we saw the end of an era for wheat growers, with major changes made by the Government to wheat marketing arrangements. However, it is regrettable that since that time wheat growers have not seen an improvement in their financial situation. Rather, owing to a range of reasons, including some of the policies foisted on them by the Government and others, such as unforeseen international events, wheat farmers are facing heavily reduced incomes. As the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA>It is regrettable that the tentative recovery which began to emerge in the international market as a result of the 1988-89 drought in North America proved to be unsustainable through 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Prospects for a significant recovery in northern hemisphere wheat crops were realised, increasing world production to record levels. </PARA>
<PARA> As a non-subsidising exporter, the AWB is dismayed by the aggressive re-emergence of export subsidies which severely distort international agricultural trade. </PARA>
<PARA>They are some of the problems that wheat growers are facing. Furthermore, the Board notes in the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Coupled with recent events in the Middle East, the immediate prospects for Australian exports and prices are not favourable. </PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, the Board concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>The increasing adverse supply/demand effect on grower returns will be further exacerbated by aggressive use of export subsidies by major competitors; the probable loss of significant sales to Iraq-</PARA>
<PARA>that is definitely true-</PARA>
<PARA>and a fluctuating Australian currency. In this environment, returns to growers on a per tonne basis could decline by about 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about it, rural wheat growers are having real problems. It is another rural industry which, I feel, very sadly, is on the skids. I can tell honourable senators opposite that rural anger with the Hawke Government is set to boil over. The inevitable boil-over reflects strong feelings that the Federal Government has savaged and sabotaged rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently we read in the newspapers of the plight of the wool industry, but this Government has also done the same thing to the wheat industry. I have met many people who are hurting, and they are bewildered as to their economic future. There is a massive feeling of having been abandoned as they see a huge cost price squeeze reduce their prospects to nothing. Their apprehension about the future has been made much worse by the Government's policies. Having been brought to their knees by Paul Keating's recession that we had to have, and his high interest rates, they are now watching with considerable apprehension Minister Kerin's destabilisation and destruction of many rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of this, they see the Hawke Government reneging on last year's undertaking to ensure that no one industry will bear the load of sanctions against Iraq. Until now, the cost of many of the trade sanctions in the Gulf has been borne by just a handful of sectors, particularly export industries, including many rural sectors covered by bodies such as the Australian Wheat Board and the Rice Marketing Board in direct and indirect ways. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave a commitment in August last year that no one sector of the Australian community would bear the burden of the cost of the trade sanctions adopted, quite correctly and properly, against Iraq and Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> We have waited a long time to see further detailed action and the provision of much needed interim assistance. We have waited in the knowledge that that assistance will have to be subsequently adjusted for the growers and exporters involved, because we cannot forget the horrific economic circumstances facing so many Australians at this time, be they in small business, the rural sector or across the board. Part of that equation has arisen because of the Gulf trade sanctions, and it is totally in order to ask for rapid action by the Federal Government with regard to dealing with those Gulf trade sanctions and the ramifications that flow from them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would briefly like to address the 1989-90 annual report of the Australian Wheat Board. I congratulate the Board on its report, but that does not mean I agree with everything in it. As the Senate probably knows, the Wheat Board has taken a new direction, after the new Wheat Marketing Act passed through this place in May 1989. The basis of that Act was the deregulation of the domestic market and the removal of the guaranteed minimum price (GMP) on a three-year rotating average. I will get back to that in a minute. Obviously, the Board has been very successful in a deregulated domestic market, which is contrary to what the industry believed at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take issue with its claim to fame on micro-economic reform. The report says that the wheat industry has been at the forefront of the push for microeconomic reform. It might have been at the forefront of pushing everyone else for it, but I am afraid it has not done too much itself. It is not necessarily the industry itself, it is its sister outfit-the bulk handling grain authorities around Australia. When my own bulk handling authority in Western Australia-Co-operative Bulk Handling Ltd-saw that the wheat industry had the chance of much cheaper freight, it jumped in and signed a three-year contract with Westrail at a price that was too high and unnecessary at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is passing and I would like to address quickly a problem that Senator Bjelke-Petersen has already spoken about; that is, the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Iraqi sanctions. As she quite rightly pointed out, he said that no single industry would carry the whole burden and that promise has not come about yet. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would really like to ask Mr Kerin is: when is he going to carry out the promise he made in 1988, when he was trying to convince us to accept losing the rotating average GMP? He said that if we return to the disastrous low prices of 1986 the Government will have to make special arrangements. The disastrous prices of 1986 have come. They have been $20 or $30 per tonne less and I am still waiting for Mr Kerin's promise to be met. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I am also very critical of the Grains Council of Australia which willingly gave up that GMP, based on a three-year rotating average, for a 2 per cent levy to set up a trading arm. It is a system that it is now trying to reverse and I am sure that, in this climate, it will not be able to do so. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology released this report by presenting it to the President on 23 January 1991. This is a significant report in that it examines the possibilities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, and makes hard recommendations for achieving those greenhouse gas reductions. The Committee concluded that the greenhouse effect is real after examining the scientific evidence and, from there, working towards finding practical and affordable solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received evidence that indicated that greenhouse gas emissions could be substantially reduced by increasing the efficiency with which we use energy and encouraging the development of new technologies, including renewable energy technology, such as solar power. </PARA>
<PARA> The achievement of greenhouse gas reductions will require a national approach. A central recommendation of the Committee is that a Special Premiers Conference be convened for the specific purpose of addressing greenhouse gas emissions. That conference should be held before the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> A key recommendation of the Committee is that a long term approach to the problem be adopted. The report focuses on energy conversion and use, and recommends that a 10-year energy plan be developed for ratification at the Special Premiers Conference. Central elements of that energy plan must include strategies in the following areas: a new charter for energy authorities emphasising least cost planning and demand management instead of traditional supply dominated approaches; more interstate sharing of power generation resources; an integrated national transport strategy, including fuel consumption standards for cars, incentives for purchasing fuel efficient vehicles and greatly improved public transport; energy use targets for houses in the commercial sector, including insulation standards and energy efficient design; national appliance labelling in all States with appliance energy standards to follow; and increased support for renewable and advanced energy technology development. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of interest in the inquiry emphasised its importance. The Committee's terms of reference call for an examination of the contribution that industry, science and technology could make to reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect. The Committee sought and received evidence in all those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> At the industry level there was some concern about the cost of measures specifically aimed at reducing the impact of greenhouse gases. On the whole, though, the approach of industry was positive in that there was an acknowledgment of the problems and planning processes are under way to address them. In addition to industry making plans in this way, the Committee identified many opportunities that exist for industry in development and manufacture of new technology. In some areas Australia is at the cutting edge of new technologies which have the potential substantially to reduce emissions and for which there will be larger future world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> A good example is photovoltaics, the solar cells which recently powered the Spirit of Biel-Bienne, which features on the cover of the report, to victory in the Darwin to Adelaide solar challenge race. They were designed at the University of New South Wales. Disappointingly, however, industry has been slow to recognise the opportunities presented by these emerging technologies. The Australian designed and developed laser groove solar cell technology on the Spirit of Biel-Bienne is a prime example. It was offered to Australian industry under favourable conditions but subsequently was sold under licence to overseas companies. BP Solar Australia Pty Ltd plans shortly to manufacture the cells in Spain with the possibility of their manufacture at a later stage in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The contribution that science and technology can make to reducing greenhouse gas emissions was investigated thoroughly by the Committee. We were heartened by the amount of research that is being undertaken and the opportunities that have been identified. Unfortunately, those opportunities have not been backed by funding to make them a reality. The contribution of funding by both governments and industry has been too low and often misdirected. </PARA>
<PARA> The report sets out clearly the need for a substantial increase in funding to projects which should become projects for national priority development. In addition to increasing funding for energy research, which in most cases equates to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Government should make a long term commitment to maintaining the 150 per cent research and development deduction rather than decreasing it to 125 per cent as it proposed. The Committee considers this action vital for the stimulation of research and development within industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's view is that reducing emissions through energy efficiency is the best approach to take until widespread international agreements about emission reductions are reached. While Australian greenhouse gas emissions per person are high by world standards, our overall total emissions are relatively insignificant when compared to the global total. The Australian Government has now set emission targets and, to be able to meet those targets, action has to be taken now. International targets when set could in all probability be more stringent than those already adopted by Australia. To be in a position to meet tougher targets in the future and not suffer severe economic cost, Australia must begin to take effective action now. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, energy efficiency measures which, as I mentioned earlier, are the most immediate and effective means for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, have economic benefits as well as environmental advantages. In many cases investment in energy efficiency pays for itself within a relatively short period. Other advantages are to be gained from energy efficiency. For example, a more efficient transport fleet will help to decrease Australia's future dependence on imported oil and reduce our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report sets out many other areas in which energy efficiency can be achieved. None of the measures in itself is new. What is required is the bringing together of a whole range of such measures in a cohesive strategy, as suggested in the report, that would result in action. In the area of greenhouse, there has been an enormous amount of talk, particularly in the past couple of years, backed up by an endless procession of conferences, seminars, studies and reports. What has been lacking is specific action to do something about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The setting of a planning target of a 20 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2005 is a good first step towards doing something meaningful about emissions. This report emphasises that it is now time to put in place measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to meet targets that have now been set. Effective action will require long term planning in many areas, for example, power generation technology and development of alternative energy sources. In addition, a commitment to research and development and funding must also be made. Immediate planning and a long term commitment will result in a future benefit for the nation in terms of both reduced greenhouse gas emissions and energy cost savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee discusses in the report the issue of energy and the greenhouse effect in much detail. The report makes specific comments about electricity generation in Australia. The Committee found that significant efficiency improvements could be made in this area. In particular, the Committee concluded that electricity utilities require a new charter. Rather than simply seeing their role as suppliers of energy, they should consider their role as suppliers of energy services. This approach combined with least cost planning could in itself lead to significant energy improvements in the way in which electricity utilities operate. Because of the significance of electricity supply as a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, a national approach must be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> State boundaries should not be a consideration. For example, because of the low efficiencies attained in Victoria from burning brown coal, the Committee would not advocate the construction of additional power stations based on brown coal in the Latrobe Valley but recommended more efficient generating technologies based on the most efficient stations using black coal. These stations currently have a conversion efficiency of approximately 35 per cent compared to the most efficient brown coal plants of 29 per cent. Better still will be the use of gas combined cycle turbines which release approximately 50 per cent less carbon dioxide than the most efficient black coal power stations. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee identified opportunities for co-generation which offer even greater efficiencies. These opportunities must be pursued before any further commitment is made to technologies whose relative inefficiency would preclude their use in future years when even tougher targets apply. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as looking at electricity generation, the Committee examined energy end use to determine whether efficiency improvements could be made. The report contains specific recommendations for commercial, industrial, residential and transport sectors which are too detailed to outline here but which would form the basis for a more detailed action plan for greenhouse gas emissions reductions based on better use of energy. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there is a big challenge facing this nation to reduce greenhouse emissions. If approached correctly, the nation can benefit from measures to meet targets. I urge all honourable senators to study the report and its implications and opportunities. I look forward to the Government's response to the report and, along with my colleagues on the Committee, will actively pursue the recommendations and strategies contained in the report with relevant Ministers and officials of the Commonwealth, significantly those at the State and local government levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank my colleagues for their support and activity in the long and complex inquiry. I have presented a number of reports over a few years now and I can say that in my experience I have not had a committee that has had a more collective effort in producing a report. I have been very pleased with the way in which we have worked so well together. The evidence of experts who provided submissions and oral evidence is also acknowledged, as is the contribution from industry and government sources. Finally, I think that the secretariat of the Committee has done excellent work in an excellent team effort. I therefore commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks made by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Unlike many other inquiries, this one on reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect was interesting, it is important and I believe it is well worth thinking about. All members of the Senate and people not in the Senate would get a lot of interesting reading just by having a look at it. Senator Childs has provided us with most of the important figures that go with the investigation that we have done, so I will try to avoid figures where I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We started off the inquiry on the basis that we did not presume that the greenhouse effect was a fact. We started off by saying that whether or not there was a greenhouse, cleaning up the atmosphere had a lot going for it. By the time we got through the first phase of finding out what the culprits were we started to look at the issues involved and what to do about them. We found that half of the warming effect comes from energy use or generation and that was the major area that we were able to start on. Power generation, motor vehicles, industry and residential areas are all contributors and we looked at all of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a look at how to start. We looked at the generation of power by other means and we looked at the use of alternative energy, how to improve transport and how to practise economy of use. We found out early on that Australia lags behind many other countries in the energy efficiency field. I realised this on a parliamentary visit to Denmark just before Christmas. We found an electricity station which was fired with Australian black coal but which also had nine wind generators in the same area. It was utilising the waste heat from the power generation by heating not only the houses of quite a large proportion of the town, but also 50,000 square metres of glasshouses that had been built. At the end of November they were picking 17 tonnes of tomatoes a day out of those glasshouses and producing 30 per cent of all the roses in Denmark as well as heating the houses. So it goes to show what can be done if we systematically look at all this energy and see how we are going to utilise it best. </PARA>
<PARA> The power generation question is the biggest problem we face and we did not spend any time at all in considering the nuclear alternative. We assumed that the nation at this juncture is not ready for contemplation of that sort of thing, so we did not spend any time on it. But we realise that brown coal primarily and black coal to a somewhat lesser degree have to be kept to the minimum level at which they can economically be used. </PARA>
<PARA> We then considered gas for electricity and found that burning gas to generate electricity is a fairly wasteful thing to do if the gas can be used as a direct means of energy in the first place-as a primary fuel. We came to the conclusion that gas should be used as a primary fuel whenever possible. At the stage we get past using gas for electricity then we need the gas for various other fuels-petrochemicals and things of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a look at a whole range of developing units. We saw various solar alternatives and the solar heaters that we have seen for heating water for years-the photovoltaic cells and so on-and we were also impressed with the solid oxide fuel cells and the availability that they will have in a wide range of uses in due course. We found that the current thinking there is that the cost per unit is not going to be much different whether it is a big unit or a small unit. In other words, we can decide how much power needs to be generated and build a unit accordingly. This means that small towns can build a unit to cover the whole town and industries of various sizes can build their own units to make it part of the plan. They would then be in charge of their own operations right through. It would enable serious co-generation and transfer of power between electricity authorities and separate generators. It would enable us to get the generation of power, to some extent at least, out of the hands of government which would be a great improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> We could see that these projects need to be organised as national priority projects and it means that we have to look at these organisations with the funny names, the ERDC, the Energy Research and Development Corporation, the NERDDP, the national energy research development and demonstration program, and the ARC, the Australian Research Council, and make sure that these are on the list. If not, we have to have special allocations just so that we can make sure these are funded adequately. The universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and, to some extent, industry are all working on it now but a stimulus is necessary. Of course, at the time that the stimulus is necessary we find that the projects that are being developed by CSIRO have had their funding cut. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman mentioned electricity audits. We believe that these are going to become important and that the householder, the commercial operator or the industry operator will want them. Whether or not it will be necessary to make them obligatory remains to be seen. But I believe they will be done just by making it attractive for people to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of labelling and branding of appliances has also been mentioned. There is the provision of bonuses for the economic use of cars through lower registration fees for cars that meet certain limits. We are now looking, according to the car clubs, for a figure of eight litres per hundred kilometres by the year 2005. They also suggested that a figure of six litres per hundred kilometres is quite possible later on. </PARA>
<PARA> Our transport generally is bad and uneconomic. It is cluttered. In the cities we have too much traffic standing about and belching out gases while it is standing still. We have to look at better ways of moving people. Certainly, in this regard I am in no doubt that a project such as the Very Fast Train, where we can shift on one line 30,000 people a day, is the sort of project that we have to consider. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can get hundreds of thousands of cars off the road and hundreds of thousands of trucks off the road and fewer aeroplanes in the air and put their passengers and freight on to a railway line on the ground, that certainly must be the way to go. We have to change our attitudes on car sharing and we have to make sure that we have the most appropriate public transport. We have to list the special projects that need to be attended to so that we have them before us and we can then work on them. We have to consider what Australians already do well and the areas where they can do best. </PARA>
<PARA> We proved years ago with ordinary solar heating that we could be leaders in the world. We can do this in a whole range of these things. Then, once we have got those, the world is a huge market. It is enormous; it is absolutely huge and vast. Australia can do it, and we ought to be concentrating on doing this. It is crazy that we get these various developments up to a certain stage and then start to cut the funds on them when, at that stage, we ought to be pouring the funds in to make sure that nothing gets between us and the ultimate goal and so that we would be able to get these things merchandised and do our bit for cleaning up the world. Governments at all levels are going to find that it is necessary to provide encouragement for economy and conservation as well, because they have a vested interest in clean atmospheres and clean countries and they must do their part towards making it more interesting. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of power utilities and what they should be doing is important. In the past, we have seen that the main aim of power utilities is to generate as much power as they possibly could and then sell it. I believe that has long since been the wrong way round. For many years I have advocated that the generating authority and the retailing authority should not be in the same hands-that they should be entirely separate-because I believe that they have a fundamental conflict of interest. The utilities are the people who should be selling the various saving appliances that are necessary, as they did in my State of Tasmania many years ago in selling block heaters when they were trying to encourage people to use more of that type of heating. I believe that they should be encouraging people to use other than electric, and they should be providing those incentives with long term loans and pay-offs with the monthly accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also certain that we need to have a much better look at the interstate load sharing, the co-generation involved and the cooperation between various industries. We need to study the building code more regularly and see how we can gently ease people into being more conscious of how they get better value for their money, and how the savings that are available can be made by changes to their various designs and buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry was a fascinating one to work on. I certainly recommend the report as interesting reading. I would like to thank the Chairman for the way that he conducted the inquiry and also the committee staff for the way that they carried it out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of the previous two speakers. It gives me particular pleasure to speak on this report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Rescue the Future-reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect. There are a number of reasons for my pleasure in this. One is that, as the Chairman and Senator Archer have already indicated, there was enormous cross-party support for concern over the question of greenhouse, the sorts of strategies, and the urgencies of the strategies that need to be adopted to address that very important problem. While often there is sniping in this chamber from certain quarters on environmental and conservation matters, on this particular Committee there was indeed a great deal of consensus, support and cooperation, which was extremely valuable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe this is one of the better reports that any Senate committee has ever tabled, because we were able to go further than one is able to with many reports in which there are substantial and fundamental differences of opinion. Those differences of opinion did not emerge in this case. As Senator Archer has said, the Chairman was a particularly good chairman. He was particularly efficient at keeping the Committee on track, as were the staff members who worked with the Committee, particularly Rob Diamond and Peter Hallahan. The whole team, the Committee and the staff, worked extremely well. As the others have already said, this Committee's report would really repay very close reading because of the distance that it has been able to go in its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say something about the genesis of this reference because there are a number of ways in which the Industry, Science and Technology Committee may have taken up a reference on greenhouse. This was recognised when I first proposed greenhouse as a reference to the Committee. First of all, some said that it was really not a matter for industry, science and technology at all; that it was a matter that should be sent off to the environment committee. That in itself indicates a certain attitude: that greenhouse is an environmental issue whereas industry, science and technology is something else. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Committee was able to see that the causes of greenhouse, the causes of the changes in the global atmosphere, relate very much to what we do with our industry and our science-how we actually apply that; the sorts of technologies that we use; and the sorts of economic systems in which we live. If we were really going to address the problem of greenhouse in terms of how we can head it off, then it was most appropriate to be tackled by the Industry, Science and Technology Standing Committee and not by the committee on environment. So that was accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Then it was interesting to see how several government departments sought to deflect the original intention of the Committee to look at how we head greenhouse off as far as that is possible. Suggestions were made such as: we should really look at collecting all the information that is available on greenhouse and simply make that available-or, conversely, how do we adapt to greenhouse? It was interesting to see the departments from which those suggestions came: Senator Button's Department, for instance, and even the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories came forward with that sort of deflective proposal. It was with some difficulty that, in the early stages of this reference, the Committee was able to stick to the reference that it wanted and take up this far more important reference; that is, greenhouse is potentially a very serious problem, and how do we do things which will avoid getting us into a greenhouse situation as far as that is possible? Indeed, that eventually was the reference that we took and, as the Chairman has said, based on that reference we went forward; took a lot of evidence; the Committee worked very hard; and the Senate has before it a really excellent report. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth saying something about the differences of opinion which lie in certain aspects of the greenhouse question because, both in the popular press and indeed in recent times in this chamber, we have seen people casting doubt on greenhouse because of the doubt which still exists over the detailed consequences of greenhouse warming. It is important to recognise where there is absolute knowledge and understanding and where the doubt still lies. There is no doubt that the composition of the atmosphere has changed very dramatically since the beginning of the industrial era, and there is no doubt that that change is continuing at quite a considerable rate-indeed far faster than at any time in the geological past. </PARA>
<PARA> There is general acceptance that the changes in the global atmosphere are related to human intervention, to the burning of fossil fuel, to the cutting of rainforests, to the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCS), to the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, and to the release of methane as a consequence of increased agricultural activities and the keeping of herbivorous animals in larger numbers. There is no doubt about that. We have good figures which come from the ice cores in the Antarctic and from Greenland. We now have a record both of global temperature and of global atmospheric composition which goes back almost 200,000 years. When that record is looked at we find there is a very, very close parallel between global temperature and the concentration of carbon dioxide over that very long period. As the concentration of carbon dioxide has gone up, so the global temperature has gone up. As the concentration of carbon dioxide has gone down, the global temperature has gone down. We find, moreover, throughout most of that time that the composition of methane in the global atmosphere has remained remarkably constant and yet in the last 100 years or so the concentration of methane has been increasing. It is currently increasing at roughly twice the rate that carbon dioxide is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is known that a number of these gases will trap the long wave infra-red radiation as it goes out from the earth into space. So there is a general scientific consensus-I will not say universal-that, as a consequence of this increase in concentration of this range of gases, there will be an increase in global temperature. From that, a number of consequences will follow. The predictions would indicate that the increases in concentration of gases so far would have resulted in about a half to one degree rise in temperature. The best evidence indicates there has been approximately half a degree rise in temperature. The problem with that observation is that there is an enormous noise in the signal of global temperature. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think any scientist would claim that at present the increase which has been observed has broken through the background noise, so there is considerable and genuine doubt as to whether the increase that has occurred so far is related to that increase in gas. All one can say is that on the theoretical models which are used it is consistent with what would be found if we were experiencing the greenhouse. Similarly, as one goes on with the other effects, as one looks at the consequences of increase in temperature, the predictions for changes in global climate, the changes in local weather patterns, the changes in sea level, the changes in the ecology of various areas, and the changes in agriculture which will occur as a consequence of those changes, there is considerable doubt about the size of those effects and the rate of onset of those effects.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to point out that that is where the doubt lies. No doubt surrounds the increase in the concentration of gases in the atmosphere. No doubt surrounds the historical, geological evidence relating the levels of gas to temperature. The best scientific opinion, although not universal, is that there will be a greenhouse effect and that within the next 10 to 15 years the increase in global temperature will unequivocally break through the background noise and we will know definitely that we are in a greenhouse phenomenon. That, I believe, is the basis on which we should be acting; that is, the basis on which we should be considering the sorts of strategies that we need to use when we approach this question of greenhouse. It is the best evidence available. The evidence is that that evidence will be corroborated within 10 to 15 years and will become unequivocal. </PARA>
<PARA> The intergovernmental panel on climate control which met last year considered this question in a number of subcommittees. The scientific sub-committee of that intergovernmental panel on climate control said that on the evidence available it was urgently necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally by as much as 60 to 80 per cent. A 60 to 80 per cent reduction is a very large reduction indeed. If one looks at the per capita emission of greenhouse emissions, one finds, as Senator Childs has already pointed out, that Australia is a very profligate user of fossil fuels, a very profligate user of CFCS and halons, and is a very significant global emitter of greenhouse gases on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA> So it becomes necessary to consider that Australia will need to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 92 per cent. I repeat that figure, 92 per cent. If we do not, then what we are essentially saying to the rest of the world is that we are usurping to ourselves an unfairly high proportion of the capacity of the global atmosphere indefinitely to absorb greenhouse gases. We are saying to the rest of the world, `Sorry, you either have to suffer a greenhouse effect with all its consequences or you have to forever forgo your fair share of the use of fossil fuels and the use of all the other technologies which result in the emission of greenhouse gases'. Morally, the situation in 10 to 15 years is very likely to be that we will be faced unequivocally with a situation in which we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 92 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at our future-honourable senators will notice that the report we are considering is titled Rescue the Future -reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect-how do we look at the next 10 to 15 years in the light of what we may have to do only that distance out? I think it follows that in cases where we can adopt lifestyle changes, technological changes, new technologies, and conservation measures which do not cost a great deal of money, which have short payback times, and even if the savings of greenhouse gas emissions which can be made are not particularly substantial, then those changes should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, we might change the sorts of light globes that we use in our houses. There is a worked example in the back of this report on how much saving that could achieve and where the monetary savings would fall. On the other hand, there are major changes in the technological structure which are now contemplated which cost a large amount of money, which have very long payback times and which may or may not achieve significant savings. These are the ones we need to be extremely careful about in the way we approach them. For instance, consider the example given by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Childs. We may consider going from a coal fired power station at 35 per cent maximum efficiency to a gas fired combined cycle station with a 50 per cent maximum efficiency. We would indeed save a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of States are considering building new power stations. If a decision is made in the next two to three years to build such a power station, a large one of a thousand megawatts will cost roughly $1 billion. It will take about 10 years to build and will come on stream sometime when the evidence that unequivocally we need to very substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a figure of 92 per cent becomes incontrovertible. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we do when we have a power station on which we have spent $1 billion, which has a lifetime of 30 to 40 years and does not achieve the efficiency improvements in terms of greenhouse gas emissions that need to be achieved? Do we decide simply to write-off $1 billion or do we go ahead and exploit that power station and continue to pollute for a long time into the future? Bringing those sorts of decisions back into the present means that in the cases where we face major expenditure with long term pay back times we must attempt to avoid making decisions on those sorts of investments as long as we possibly can. That is where many of the efficiency improvements which are mentioned in this report come into place. There are many ways in which industry, individuals and society as a whole can conserve electricity so that the existing installed electricity-generated capacity is sufficient to meet those needs over the next 10 to 15 year time span and it becomes unnecessary to build more power stations. It is urgent that we lay pressure on the Western Australian Government-there is a case at the moment-not to build the power station that it is contemplating, but to increase far more significantly the energy conservation measures which can be put in place and which would significantly reduce the demand for electricity and so extend the life of the existing installed capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland is another State in which a further power station is being contemplated. Again, it should be pressured not to make that decision and to avoid the building of any more power stations until well into the early years of the next century. There are good reasons for doing this, quite apart from the energy saving. The power utilities in Australia currently owe $27 billion. They have been very profligate not only with the building of power stations and the encouragement of the inefficient use of electricity, but also with the spending of public money. A large part of that debt is foreign owed because when power stations are built the heavy generating equipment comes offshore, as does a lot of the other equipment used in power generation, transformation and transmission. If a decision can be made not to build more power stations over the next 10 to 15 years there are very considerable economic savings as well as greenhouse gas savings to Australia. The rate of increase of debt of the utilities far and away exceeds the rate of growth of the economy, and there would be very good reasons for that decision to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to many of these conservation measures lies in the way electricity is charged for. I ask honourable senators to look at page 169 of the report. There is an example of the way in which a decision by a householder to buy an incandescent globe or a compact fluorescent globe results in an overall reduction in the cost both to the community and the consumer. Most of the saving actually accrues to the utility because the capital cost of installing the generating equipment for 65 watts of electricity is roughly $65, whereas the equivalent compact fluorescent globe taking 13 watts requires only $13 of capital investment by the utility. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the savings of a decision which is made by the individual consumer actually accrue not to the consumer but to the utility. This suggests that one urgent necessity in achieving greater efficiencies in the use of electricity is to ensure that there is a shift of that benefit from the utility to the ultimate consumer of electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> If we extend this example to the consideration of purchasing a solar hot water service or an electric hot water service, we find that if a consumer decides to buy a solar hot water service, all the up-front capital cost is paid for by the consumer-roughly $1,700 or $1,800-whereas if the decision is to buy an electric hot water service, the consumer might save, initially, some $1,100 in that purchase. In doing so, the utility which must supply the electricity is faced with anything between $3,000 and $7,000 worth of capital investment required to put in the generating equipment to provide the electricity for the electric hot water service. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the decision by the individual consumer, which is based perhaps on a concern over greenhouse and using renewable energy, would leave the individual consumer with an initial up-front capital cost of an additional $1,100, which would only be slowly recouped over eight or nine years, but in the process the utility would make a very substantial saving in not having to install a large amount of generating capacity. The key to getting people to use solar hot water as distinct from electric hot water is simply to shift some of that economic gain from the utility to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to notice that in my own State of South Australia, where the electricity tariffs are severely weighted against the consumer, there is only about 1 1/2 per cent penetration of solar hot water services, whereas in Perth, where the tariff structures are more reasonably arranged, there is about a 30 per cent penetration of solar hot water services. So, quite clearly, very significant shifts can be achieved through providing the right incentives. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that I think bears some mention-this has already been mentioned by both honourable senators-is the way in which this country has developed some extremely clever technology. I personally become very distressed when I hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) say that we must become a clever country. We are an extremely clever country. In terms of scientific papers which are published in reputable, refereed, scientific journals, Australia is the most productive country in the world. We are a clever country indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of alternative energy sources, we have some extremely clever and absolutely first class developments which are lacking proper support from this Government and, therefore, are likely to go off-shore and be developed by others and then we will have to import them back again. Senator Archer and Senator Childs have referred to several of these, but I think they bear some repetition. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of the solid oxide fuel cell would not merely increase efficiency from 35 to 50 per cent-which I mentioned earlier, going from coal to combined cycle gas-but may well increase the efficiency of the generation of electricity up to 60 to 70 per cent. Moreover, as Senator Archer pointed out, these units, which can be built in any size from a kilowatt up to hundreds of megawatts, would allow the units to be installed in factories down on the corner, if you like, of each suburban block, and the waste heat, which is about 30 per cent as distinct from 60 to 70 per cent with a conventional power station, can be used locally. </PARA>
<PARA> One can then increase the efficiency with which one uses the gas in the solid oxide fuel cell up to 90 per cent or more. That is a technology in which Australia leads the world. We have made a number of objects out of zirconium oxide, which no other country has succeeded in manufacturing. We have been able to make a very hard ceramic, which is the essential core of the fuel cell and which would substantially increase efficiency in the ways I have indicated. It is a technology the world will be crying out for in 10 to 15 years time; it is a technology for which the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is seeking a modest amount of only $10m or $15m to develop over the next five to six years, yet we find that the Federal Government is failing to support that technology. I repeat: we do not need to become a clever country; we need some wiser government which will see where we must get to in 10 to 15 years time and start making the appropriate investments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Childs, also indicated the development of the very efficient solar photovoltaic cells by Professor Martin Green at the University of New South Wales. As most honourable senators will know, these were on the car which won hands down the solar car race from Darwin to Adelaide, yet the cells in that case, although designed in Australia, were actually manufactured under licence by AEG-Telefunken in Germany and placed on a Swiss car. The technology, including the whole production line on which the cells were made, has been sold to BP Australia but, as the Chairman indicated, BP Solar Australia will make those cells first in Spain, not in this country. This is a technology which is percentage points ahead of the best technology anywhere else in the world. It is a proven technology, not just a laboratory freak-it has been put into a production mode-which again we are likely to lose offshore unless we look at it very seriously in terms of the appropriate support; that is, support to the stage of actually installing it. </PARA>
<PARA> Extending from that we find at Sydney University the development of a total solar car, one which would have on board solar cells charging batteries but in which the other solar cells would be on the roof of the carport, charging batteries which would then charge the batteries in the car. One can see the possibility of a transport system in which 70 per cent of all journeys are driven by solar energy. That is a development that we have right here on our doorstep. That is a development that this Government should support; the vision the Government needs to pick up out of this report on the greenhouse effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on the report Rescue the Future-reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect. It is really good for a change to be able to commend something wholeheartedly, as I can with this report, in particular its strong statements in support of action rather than further rhetoric, or placatory press releases which pretend to be paying attention to the problem while only putting off decisions on actions which will become more expensive and more difficult the longer we wait. The time for action is obviously immediate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been some recent papers by experts like Brian O'Brien using their scientific credentials to attempt to lull Australians into believing that we can wait another century before we take this urgent action on greenhouse gas emissions and let future generations worry about the problem. It is hardly a responsible attitude and it is very worrying indeed that some scientists are using their credentials to discredit people who have been making a genuine effort around the globe to enlighten not only governments but also people in the community about the need for urgent action. Some industry figures also seem to be taking this approach, arguing international competitiveness as a reason for inaction rather than looking at trying to improve the energy efficiency of Australian industry and seizing the initiative in areas such as energy efficient and renewable energy technologies, which, as I indicated in my speech on another subject today, would be excellent export opportunities for Australian companies instead of trading in weapons of death. </PARA>
<PARA> This is something positive which the world urgently needs and there is a huge market, and the cutting edge is available now for companies that are prepared to take the initiative, obviously with the backing of government. We need to have the research and development funds redeployed from weapons technology and weapons industry to energy efficient industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The report comments on energy generation. I support strongly the comments in section 1.7 and chapter four. All opportunities for co-generation and energy savings through efficiency which can be realised at a lower cost than installing new capacity should be exploited before any new power station developments are permitted. It is recommended that the Commonwealth Government take the advice of the Committee and not allow further borrowing by the States to finance such stations until those opportunities have been exploited. In the case of my own State, Western Australia, the State Government is committed to either a new coal-fired power station or a new gas-fired power station and has not really explored the opportunities that already exist for greater energy efficiency. The question is not really being asked at government or industry level about whether we need a new power station at all. That is the important question that should be asked, and the recommendations of this report should be heeded in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the issue should not be clouded by focusing on the differences between precise predictions of greenhouse effects. As the Committee rightly points out, there is no doubt that the greenhouse effect is real and the weight of evidence is that emission targets are likely to be scaled up rather than down if we are to tackle the problem seriously. The report also points out that there are technologies, such as solid oxide fuel cells, and proven energy management systems that can be adopted to improve greatly the efficiency of energy production and use in Australia. I urge that the Government adopt the Committee's excellent strategies and recommendations and act on them as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Coulter's remarks about the clever country. The clever country regarding greenhouse will be the one that ends up exporting technology and information on how to be more energy efficient and hence lead the world in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. That huge window of opportunity is wide open right now. Basically I would like to stress that we have heard all the talk; now we need to stop dithering and, in the strongest possible way, encourage action. We need to do something immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join my remarks to those of my colleagues. Firstly, I congratulate the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on this report and thank my colleagues, in particular our Chairman, Senator Bruce Childs. I think Senator Childs has polished tolerance to an art form. While he did say that we were a graceful and conciliatory committee, which is true, in the best of committees there are from time to time strains on the Chair and Senator Childs was exemplary with his tolerance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is fair to say that it was a Committee that largely operated-if not all the time, 99 per cent of it-with goodwill and with a real enthusiasm for what it was doing. We were asked to address a series of questions which were very interesting and relevant. I think all members of the Committee, for whatever reason-our experience, our working background and our histories before we came into the Senate-had an interest in this subject that meant it was of real interest to all of us. I think the Committee benefited from that kind of enthusiasm and inquiry amongst the members of the Committee. I also place on record our appreciation of the Secretary of the Committee, Rob Diamond; the research staff, Peter Hallahan and Sue Morton; and the executive assistant, Glenice Castles. I am also appreciative of the many photographs in this report and I think we should draw attention to the photographer, Peter West, who has done a splendid job of photographing Committee members. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, I want to make two points tonight. I understand that this debate will be adjourned and there will be time for more contributions on what is a very thorough and comprehensive report, one of those volumes which honourable senators could well put on their shelves and use as a source for basic data. </PARA>
<PARA> At the urging of not only our Chairman but also all members of the Committee, the report has been written so that it can be understood by people who are not scientifically literate in these complex areas. The measures of energy and other specific language, particularly of mathematics and so on, can be off-putting to people if they are trying to make sense of this complex question. There are lots of tables and explanatory descriptions in the volume, which means that it can be on the shelves of just about anybody in this community, particularly anyone with an interest in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> While I agree with honourable senators who say that the greenhouse effect is real, I think that to some extent the debate on that is still open. I would prefer to think that it is real and to take that view when we deliberate on these issues. However, we should also be prepared to say that more evidence may still come in on this issue. If we are to be honest and open in our inquiry into the greenhouse effect, we must not rush into judgment about what the greenhouse impact will be and all the things that are claimed to contribute to greenhouse. I hasten to make it clear that that does not mean that I am disbelieving of greenhouse; I am just a long time sceptic. </PARA>
<PARA> While appreciating the significance of the prospects of greenhouse and the increasing evidence of it, I make it clear that we have to hasten cautiously before we guarantee all the greenhouse claims are real. I think the report stands with or without the greenhouse effect. Again, let me make it clear that I put my name to and am happy with the words in the report. Notwithstanding the greenhouse effect, this report would hold in terms of its urging energy efficiency and better use of energy. Paragraph 1.5 at page 4 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Fortunately there are benefits available immediately through energy efficiency and conservation measures, and the use of renewable energy sources, which would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and yield an economic return. </PARA>
<PARA>If one takes out the words `reduce greenhouse emissions' the sentence still reads with sense and credibility in terms of use of energy efficient and conservation measures to yield an economic return. I would say to people who are still disbelieving or sceptical about greenhouse that this report deserves their serious examination even if they constrain themselves to only the energy efficiency dimensions. For that reason I could strongly endorse almost all of the remarks of Senator Coulter who, along with others in the debate tonight, referred again and again to more efficient uses of energy. I believe Senator Childs referred to that also. While not wanting to discount the greenhouse effect, I believe the report is valid even if it were not the case. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that it would be possible, through the application of energy conservation and efficiency measures which would yield an economic return, to avoid the building of any more electricity power stations during the critical period of the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from pages 5 and 6 of the report. I add my support for such considerations already addressed by my colleagues. Under 1.9 at page 6, the point of cost savings and energy efficiency is raised again. Curiously we found that some witnesses who came before us almost found themselves arguing against energy efficiency because of the slow return of benefit to themselves. In the end they seemed to be arguing almost for no change because it was easier and introduced notions of Australia's international competitiveness and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> But the evidence given to the Committee clearly suggests that there are huge economic benefits by being energy efficient, not only for government-State or Federal-and the whole community but also for individuals both at the household level and in business and industry. In concluding my remarks on that section, I indicate that the report stands in terms of its very useful information on energy efficiency and the economic benefits that would come from industry and government making sure that they optimised their understanding of the most constructive use of energy in our society. There is talk of energy audits and so on of buildings. Clearly a lot of work can be done. For those who have that kind of interest I think this report is well worth reading. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the section highlighting the energy efficiency possible in the transport area. This matter concerned the Committee because, as the report states under 5.1 at page 74:</PARA>
<PARA>Transport is the second largest sectoral contributor to Australian carbon dioxide emissions, contributing 26% of the national total. Of this, road transport is responsible for nearly 80%. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 5.2 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Cars, station wagons, utilities and panel vans together are the single largest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the country and are responsible for 60% of transport sector emissions and 14.8% of national emissions. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 5.3 tells us that three-quarters of all car use is for urban transport. There are more constructive pieces of pithy evidence about trucks, road transport and so on. The report spends some time talking about the importance of an integrated national transport strategy. I raise this because in my State of South Australia in very recent times we have seen the closure of three rail passenger services. It is curious to find oneself sitting on a committee and urging the use of rail for passenger as well as freight transport at the same time as three passenger services in my State were being closed down. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to dispute the evidence that allowed Australian National to make those decisions. However, one of the things that concerned us was the lack of data or capacity to build into the equation of what is efficient or economically necessary some cost into the future of what happens if and when we have to replace train lines or rolling stock, passenger cars and so on because we have finally arrived at appreciating the importance of passenger and freight options. I hope that the Government, in looking at its national transport strategy, will try to find ways of building into the equation the cost factors into the future of winding down infra- structure and then finding it has to capitalise it up again. At the same time, I do not believe that we have any adequate models of quantifying the cost of greenhouse and the effects of that over time. Both of those have to be part of our calculations when we look at efficiencies of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I found the contradiction of writing a report in favour of a national transport strategy and promoting the use of rail for passengers as well as freight at the same time as three passenger services were closing ironic in the extreme. I reiterate the comments of my colleagues that this is a very constructive and useful report and urge all honourable senators to give it their serious consideration. </PARA>

Therefore, an adjournment for a period of, say, two months seems to be the best way in which to resolve that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators may not be aware of the fact that it was my intention this evening to seek leave to table certain documents. I gather that honourable senators are possibly aware of the fact that that has been a matter of some considerable deliberation between me and the President throughout the day. Honourable senators will also be aware of the fact that in recent days certain documents which are now publicly considered documents of extreme public importance have been in circulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These documents reveal certain things about the behaviour of Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia's largest bank. These documents have attracted a great deal of public attention, so much public attention in fact that Westpac has sought to suppress these documents in a range of ways. First, it sought a series of injunctions to ensure that the documents were not published in the media in three countries-the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. Secondly, at the opening of the bank inquiry on Tuesday last week, the Managing Director of Westpac, in his opening statements, made a legal statement to the bank inquiry. He requested that the bank inquiry return the document in its possession and that the document not be considered by the bank inquiry. That request was made by Mr Stuart Fowler, Managing Director of Australia's largest bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Westpac placed public advertisements in the media in an attempt to get back into its hands and constrain all copies of the documents. My advice is that there are literally hundreds of them in circulation. They came from Belgium, from a foreign source not known to me. But I am in possession of those documents and I believe it is in the public interest that they be tabled in the Senate. I have advised the President that I intend to seek leave during this adjournment debate to table and incorporate those documents. I have discussed the matter at some length with the President. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Perhaps this is the appropriate stage for me to make a statement on this matter. On 8 and 11 February 1991, Westpac Banking Corporation made two submissions to me suggesting that I should not allow Senator McLean to reveal in proceedings in the Senate two documents, which are said to be advice by Westpac's legal advisers to Westpac, on the grounds of the sub judice principle. Senator McLean, at my invitation, made a submission to me on 12 February 1991 to the effect that he should be permitted to disclose the documents in the Senate because of the public interest in their contents and the freedom of the Senate to debate matters of public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a difficult and delicate issue on which it is clearly possible for different views to be strongly held. On balance, I do not think that it is appropriate for Senator McLean to reveal in the Senate the contents of the two documents he seeks to disclose, at least while the legal proceedings specifically involving these two documents are still current. </PARA>
<PARA> The sub judice rule, which is not a matter of law, but rather the practice of the Senate, is capable of application with varying degrees of strictness. It is always possible for the Presiding Officer, and ultimately the Senate itself, to take the view that any real and present danger to legal proceedings currently in progress is outweighed by the public interest in the matter in question and the prima facie right of the Senate to debate it. The most familiar, and probably the clearest, case for the application of the sub judice principle is one where the material in question goes to the guilt or innocence of a person currently on trial before a jury- and the clearest case for its non-applicability is in the context of a so-called stop writ issued for defamation in a case which is unlikely to be ultimately pursued in court. There are many cases, however, in between where some fine judgment has to be exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> In the present case I believe that judgment should be exercised in favour of non-disclosure for the following two reasons. The very subject matter of the case immediately before the courts, and in respect of which the sub judice claim is made, is the question as to whether the documents involved should be suppressed. To disclose the documents now would ipso facto abort that case. No clearer example of real and present danger to current legal proceedings could be imagined. Indeed, it is not merely a matter of the present proceedings being prejudiced, but rather a particular litigant's rights being denied absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA> While the subject matter of the documents may raise public interest issues, as Senator McLean strongly argues, there is equally a very clear public interest in judicial proceedings being able, and being seen to be able, to be brought to conclusion without being aborted by the Senate. From this point of view, it is not pertinent that a different situation may be thought to apply in practice once the present proceedings are complete. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters to which I have given consideration. Firstly, it is arguable also that the claim of legal professional privilege which has been made in court in relation to these documents itself raises a public interest question, namely, that the Senate should not lend itself to a breach of this privilege being perpetrated. This, in my judgment, is a matter to be given some consideration, but should not be regarded as decisive. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is also arguable that other proceedings current or pending could be prejudiced or at least `coloured' by the public disclosure of the material in question, even though such material would presumably not be admissible, on legal professional privilege grounds, in those proceedings. On balance, however, this is not a matter, I believe, that needs to be addressed at this stage. It can be considered if and when the matter arises again following the conclusion of the present court proceedings relating to the suppression of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons I have spelt out I rule, accordingly, on sub judice grounds that the contents of the two documents in question should not be revealed to the Senate. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it goes without saying that I am bitterly disappointed that you have ruled that way. I have argued to you, I believe with great conviction and certainly commitment, that the matter is very much in the public interest. I accept your ruling. However, in order to place on record the arguments which I put to you, I would now like to present for the information of honourable senators the contents of our correspondence on this matter in the last 36 hours. I read to the Senate your letter to me:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLean</PARA>
<PARA> I have received from the Legal Division of Westpac Banking Corporation a submission which indicates that you may have some intention of disclosing in the Senate letters written to Westpac by its solicitors, Allen Allen and Hemsley, dated 26 November and 11 December 1987. The submission suggests to me that I should prevent the disclosure of the letters in the Senate under the sub judice principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the bank's submission is that disclosure of the documents in the Senate should be restrained under the sub judice principle because some disclosure would prejudice legal proceedings in which the bank is currently engaged, namely, proceedings in which the bank aims to prevent further disclosure of the documents. The bank concedes that when these proceedings are complete there will be no question of the sub judice principle arising and therefore no impediment to the disclosure of the documents in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The disclosure of the documents would appear to be technically contrary to the sub judice principle in that such disclosure could be prejudicial to these proceedings, in the sense that the proceedings would be rendered largely ineffectual. The sub judice principle is always subject to the discretion of the Chair to allow proceedings in the Senate even where those proceedings could be prejudicial to legal proceedings. One of the matters which is taken into account in exercising that discretion is the public interest in the matters in issue and the freedom of the Senate to debate matters of public interest. In applying the sub judice principle, the Chair errs on the side of allowing proceedings in the Senate to be as free as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that any decision I make on this matter will rest on an assessment of whether the public interest in the matter and the Senate's freedom to debate it should outweigh the possible prejudice to the legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore write to inquire whether it is your intention to seek to disclose these documents in proceedings in the Senate. If that is your intention, it would be helpful to me if you would put to me, as soon as possible, and preferably by 10 a.m. tomorrow morning, any matters you think I should take into account in making a decision, particularly any submission you wish to make as to the public interest in the content of the documents and the Senate's right to debate them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would prefer to read it; it is very close to my heart. My letter dated this morning reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Mr President</PARA>
<PARA> This is in reply to your letter to me of February 11, 1991, concerning my intentions in relation to the enclosed Westpac documents. </PARA>
<PARA> I respectfully advise you that it is my intention, subject to your ruling, in the public interest to seek leave to table the documents and have them incorporated in the Hansard record of an adjournment speech I propose to make tonight. I will remove the names of individuals from the documents. Should leave be denied, I will read the letters into the Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> You are aware that for more than two years I have alleged to the Senate that malpractice and corruption are present in Australian banking. I have twice moved for a Senate inquiry and have attempted to provide my colleagues with the evidence to justify this. The documents now before you and others to which they refer are, to use their own words, `devastating'. They admit to the malpractice and fraud to which I have attested. But Sir, they go further, they aid and abet the obstruction of just outcomes for those who might seek redress. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, legal privilege is a fundamental cornerstone of our society; that is to say, the right of an individual to reveal all to her or his legal advisers in total confidentiality so as to clarify where he or she may stand at law. Such a right deserves the protection inherent in legal privilege. However, once having received legal advice that he or she has broken the law, (in this case fraud), any legal advice which follows and which is advice as to how effectively to obstruct justice thereafter does not attract such privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, I argue that the documents are self-damning of PPL, Westpac and Allen, Allen &amp;Hemsley. Further, I contend that they are documents of profound public interest which neither attract nor deserve any legal privilege whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I place the same high value on my privilege as a parliamentarian as I ascribe to worthy legal documents. My privilege, which I now feel duty bound to use again in the public interest, is not one to be used lightly. I have not done so in the past and most certainly do not do so now. </PARA>
<PARA> Testimony to the potency of these documents lies not only in the words they contain but in the fact that Westpac has sought first, to constrain through injunction, their publication in three countries; second, that Mr Fowler in his opening statement to the House of Representatives Inquiry into Banking sought to have the Inquiry disregard and return them arguing that they enjoyed a privilege which they clearly do not have; third, that Westpac placed large advertisements in national newspapers in a futile attempt to call in all copies of these documents; finally, that they seek your ruling to constrain me from tabling them in protection of the public interest they have so thoroughly abused. Note, Sir, that at no stage has the authenticity of these documents been denied or challenged. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President it is asserted that the question is whether the needs of public interest outweigh the principle of sub-judice. I am advised that the rules of the court relating to sub-judice only apply to protect the impartiality of a jury in civil and criminal proceedings, and only apply when a jury has been impounded. Therefore they are without relevance in this Westpac appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that there is a presumption of the law that a judge sitting alone, or an appeal court, will have regard only for the matters before the court and will not be swayed or influenced by any extraneous matters. On this advice Sir, I can only conclude that the question of the abuse of the principle of sub-judice is irrelevant. The contents of the letters themselves make clear that the public interest must prevail. But please let me make several points concerning the gravity of the abuse of fiduciary duty as bankers which PPL and Westpac officers have exhibited. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously banks are in a position of gravest responsibility. This is embodied in law in the fiduciary obligation; i.e. the obligation of bankers to consider the interests of their clients equal to their own. These documents clearly state that in the management (indeed in their own admission, non-management) of foreign currency loans, PPL abandoned its fiduciary obligation. These documents attest to the fact that Westpac (and indeed I have argued all four major banks) created a flawed product, promoted it vigorously deliberately marketing it in such a way that all risks lay with the client and all profit lay with the banks.

If, in his own letter, he in fact retailed the full subject matter of the substantive content of the letters in respect of which you have made your ruling then, clearly, he would just be flouting your ruling by a circuitous route. The mere fact that he is quoting his own letter cannot possibly be enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter that you do have to rule upon, Mr President-and I think it is very finely balanced-is whether or not Senator McLean is doing anything more than giving his own general characterisation of the content of that letter, or whether he is actually revealing the content of the letter. That is a matter of fine judgment, and it is a judgment that you will have to make, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA> To some extent Senator McLean is entitled to argue his public interest case by general reference to the kind of material that is in the letters in question, but he is certainly not entitled to draw attention to the actual content of those letters. He can characterise in general terms, but once he moves to a description of the actual content of those letters then he is in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I have heard so far he has one foot over the edge of the precipice and I think that if he goes any further down the path that he has chosen he will, in fact, take a tumble in terms of being in breach of your ruling. I am suggesting, with the utmost respect, that that is the matter you have to take into account: how specifically is he purporting to retail the content of those letters as distinct from generally characterising what it is, in broad terms, that they are about?

When one uses an expression such as `these documents clearly state' and then goes on to talk in terms which can only be intended to give insights into what is actually in the documents, one is clearly putting before the Senate by a device the very sort of material that you and the courts have said should not be put before the public at this time. It is of no consequence and, indeed, erroneous for Senator McLean to suggest that somehow, if this is not a criminal matter, it is not a relevant proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I agree with Senator Evans on one point; that is, that there is a matter of fine judgment, but to make that fine judgment it is necessary to have the information at hand. That is precisely what Senator McLean was attempting to do-to put before the Senate information on which the decision was made. It seems to me that your ruling, from which Senator McLean has not dissented, depends upon the fact that there is a matter before the courts, that matter being that a document is in existence which is legal advice from the lawyers of Westpac Banking Corporation to Westpac and whether that document attracts some privilege and, therefore, should not be revealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean put to you that it was in the public interest that that document be revealed. The reason for his wanting to do that was to show that it was legal advice not only as to the nature of Westpac's claimed misdemeanour-I will put it in that term-but also as to how Westpac might avoid the consequences of that misdemeanour. That is the point that brings it fairly and squarely into the public interest and away from the area of being sub judice. That is the point which Senator McLean was attempting to establish. To establish that he must give at least sufficient of the background of this situation to make it clear that the document goes that far, that it removes it from the area of sub judice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. I invite you to rule that Senator McLean is not entitled to characterise your ruling as censorship. It has not in any way been treated in that manner. As I understood it, the debate was clearly over the limits of how far he might go in arguing the public interest case. You have ruled-quite properly in our judgment, but it is a matter for you-that there are certain matters that ought not to be disclosed at this stage. It is, indeed, offensive to the Senate to have that suggested by a senator because quite clearly he is not accepting your ruling.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In doing all of this banks have utterly altered the ethos of banking and rendered it a sham. It is in the public interest that this be known and these documents do that. One senior legal adviser commented that these documents are potentially the most potent documents he has seen in 50 years of law practice. Managed foreign currency loans were a flawed bank product, the promotion and sale of which have the potential to destroy the financial backbone of Australian small business and farming in serving the interests of bank greed. Likewise thalidomide was the flawed pharmaceutical product which destroyed and devastated lives. The only difference lies in the nature of the product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Corporate Australia has a poor image within the international business community. Non-disclosure rather than disclosure of these abuses would reinforce that impression. I sat in on the hearings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the Australian banking industry in Melbourne last Wednesday and heard it argued by two of Australia's leading bankers that the foreign currency loans experience was most unfortunate but that these borrowers had been advised that these were risky ventures. </PARA>
<PARA> I refute that they were so advised but even if they were and even if such borrowers were punting then the banks were the bookies, who, like all shrewd bookies, laid off without providing clients the same risk cover, who, through point taking, changed the odds after accepting the bets, who, through deal swapping, reassigned the tickets that they had written. This analogy is not without merit. If it is accepted then Australia's leading bankers reduce the ethos of banking to that of the racetrack, abuse the trust of their clients and reduce the banking institution to a sham. </PARA>
<PARA> I have argued for two years that the managed foreign currency loan is but one example of bank malpractice and corruption. Finally, Westpac now seeks, again on the advice of its lawyers, to frustrate the public interest by achieving delay. This is the tactic that it so often directed, demoralised and devastated clients with. It is the public interest which is deserving; the principle of sub judice is not relevant to this legal process. I respectfully seek a ruling which allows me to disclose these vital documents tonight assigned to me. That is the case which did not prevail. The public interest has not prevailed in this matter. I do not rest on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk about something that has nothing to do with banking. I highlight part of the continuing story of the increasing coverage of women's sport. I do so because a number of things come together at this time. First of all, I publicly put on the record my congratulations to Ann Mitchell who received an Order of Australia in the recent honours list and is one of the driving forces for Australian women's cricket in this country. She enjoys support not only for her recent Order but also for the work she has put into promoting a different understanding and acceptance of women's cricket.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While it also may not be exactly popular at this time to congratulate the Australian Broadcasting Corporation I would like to do so for its picking up of women's sport, and particularly women's cricket, during its ordinary news sports segment. It has been excellent coverage and it has highlighted the skills and capacity of the cricket teams, particularly the Australian team which is doing so splendidly against a very conservative and cautious Indian team. I understand that we have beaten that team honourably and splendidly. We have also seen a coverage of women's cricket which is remarkably different from the coverage it was enjoying in this country in 1984 and 1985 with an English tour. The coverage, such as it was, trivialised women's cricket. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also very impressed when I opened my Melbourne Age yesterday to discover a very large story on the back page. That is not the usual place for finding any coverage of women's sport let alone women's cricket. Again, it was a thoughtful, sensible and proper sporting article picking up on the achievements of our Australian women cricketers and, in particular, the second highest test score ever made by an Australian woman. A lot of records have fallen in this tour and I would like to congratulate the Australian women's cricket team for its success. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note for the record the increased coverage of women's sport by our media. Again, I refer not only to the increased coverage but also to the increased seriousness with which it is taken. While I am on the subject of women's cricket I acknowledge Shell's contribution with a very significant sponsorship in terms of dollars to that sport around this country. Of course, one of the reasons we are seeing increased media coverage is that the women's sporting organisations are now picking up sizeable sponsorships so that, as well as increasing their skills, they can actually get the recognition that previously perhaps has not been available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting exercise that we have been able to do, and it is very insufficient, is to look at the major dailies for the last week or so. They show a remarkable change in the coverage of women's sport. The last time this was measured was late last year and at that time the column inches of major dailies devoted to women's sport had gone from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of column inches. While these are not a research document, one would have to understand clearly that the percentage must have increased. Indeed, my own State newspapers, the Advertiser and the News, which have been at the front of news coverage for women's sport, may be in jeopardy as the leaders, along with the Hobart Mercury, because I note in particular that the Age, the Herald-Sun and the Daily Telegraph Mirror have very significantly extended their coverage of women's sport. The Sydney Morning Herald over the same days was not so extensive. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the stories that all newspapers seem to have covered was the achievement of Kerry Saxby in breaking her thirtieth world record and becoming the greatest breaker of world records of all time. I had the pleasure of presenting to her the Sportswoman of the Year prize last year from the Australian Sportswomen's Association. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I would like to make goes back to increased sponsorship. It was last week that I was in Sydney when the announcement of Mobil sponsorship for Australian women's netball was made. It involves a very significant amount of money, and it is not only to elite netball, but it also goes to community netball at all levels, in particular with assistance to State coaching and netball training. Netball is claimed to be the largest participatory sport for women in this country. I very much appreciate and endorse this sponsorship, and I congratulate Mobil on picking up netball sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Burke from Mobil somewhat amusingly said that those of us who are interested in these things might have noticed that Mobil was in the process of incorporating Esso into its stable. Some people might have thought this was a corporate decision, but he said that in fact the real reason was that Mobil was wanting to pick up Australian women's netball sponsorship, including the Prime Minister's Cup, which I inaugurated for Australian women's netball. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that that sport will now have the security of guaranteed sponsorship, and a dramatic increase in sponsorship, from Mobil. I do congratulate the sponsors-and there are many more but I will not list them all-who are now appreciating the importance of women's sport in this country, not only as a matter of fairness, but as a matter of good corporate economic decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say that not too long ago Australian women golfers were paid a very significant contract to go to Japan to model golfing clothing for women golfers around the world, and the spokesman for the Japanese firm which actually arranged for the Australian women to do that modelling made the comment that he was very shocked at Australian business and the way in which financial opportunities in women's sport in this country had been completely overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that what we are seeing with this increased coverage and the increasing sponsorship for women's sport is a recognition at last of the economic opportunities for support of women's sport. It is not just a matter of, `Would it not be good if . . . ?'; it is a matter of appreciating the economic realities of supporting women's sport, and also appreciating the contents of the study done by the Australian Sports Commission, I believe, about 12 months ago, highlighting the percentage of household income spent on sport. As I recollect it, between 10 per cent and 18 per cent of household income is spent on sport and recreation. Clearly, some of that goes to tickets to the theatre and tickets for spectator sport and so on-it is not all devoted to participation in sport or the buying of equipment-but there is a very large market which I think a lot of Australian firms have overlooked. So it is a matter of economic good sense, as well as equity, that we do see decisions taken to support and encourage the increased coverage of women's sport. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I do not mind wondering aloud whether the current inquiry before the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee looking at the effectiveness of our affirmative action and equal opportunity legislation, which has received so many submissions about women's sport, may not indeed have contributed to the rapid increase in the coverage of women's sport. To everyone's amazement, a very large number of submissions to that committee highlighted the inequities in funding for women's sport, in prize money, and in assistance. If that committee of inquiry, in anticipation of its report, is having this effect, then I am only too happy that that is the outcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week I had intended, as the Senate was advised during the last week of last year's sittings, to bring before it a motion which would establish an inquiry into the administration of the Family Law Act. The Australian Democrats had indicated that they would be supporting this motion and, to that end, Senator Spindler and I had worked for some weeks to come to an agreement on what we believed were the correct terms of reference for that inquiry. At this stage I thank those persons who did so much on the inquiry while I was away at the end of last year: Senator Hill, Senator Boswell, Senator Spindler and also Senator Harradine, who spoke on the issue when I was away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But yesterday, at what I can only describe as a somewhat belated stage in the whole of the negotiation process and in the entire history of the issue of trying to get an inquiry into the Family Law Act, the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) decided, albeit a little reluctantly, to agree to a joint inquiry, which was what we were looking for a year ago. I received the news with some ambivalence. I am very pleased that the Government has agreed to come along on this issue but, as I have said, we in the Senate have actually worked on the terms of reference and I thought the matter could have been finalised this week. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned at this change of heart by the Government because it does mean further delays and further negotiations going backwards and forwards for the terms of reference. I am conscious that I have given a commitment directly to hundreds of people, and indirectly to possibly thousands, that this Parliament would establish an inquiry to review the Family Law Act. I had hoped that it could have proceeded last May when I first raised the issue and gave my first notice of motion. I then hoped that it could have been finalised in August at the start of the Budget session. At the end of the last session the Senate had a debate on the subject and it was then intended that the matter would have been finalised between the Democrats and the Opposition in this place. As I said, I thought we would be bringing the full version to the Senate in the next day or so. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed, yet grateful, if you like, that the Government has taken so long to agree with this. It could have got under way a year ago when it was first proposed, and we would have had the inquiry well into being and finalised at this stage. I can only advise the Senate that now, having come this far, I do not intend-nor does the Opposition intend-to be put off for much longer. I urge the Attorney-General, in the negotiations with us, to reach a good agreement on the terms of reference as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue, Mr Deputy President, is extremely important and too many people in the community are hurting from the consequences of some of the problems with the Family Law Act. For this Parliament to fiddle around the edges will do us no justice whatsoever, and we owe the people out there a quick and speedy resolution of the terms of reference. If we are to have an inquiry then let us get on with it, and the sooner we start the better. We cannot wait any longer to fix up some of the problems with accessibility, counselling, arbitration and independent mediation and to look at issues such as equitable resolution of custodial and access disputes and the effectiveness of current procedures in arriving at fair and equitable resolution of maintenance and property disputes. These are all issues that were in the original terms of reference a year ago. We have to get on with fixing up the enforcement provisions; with looking at the performance of the Child Support Agency scheme; with looking at whether children are being as well taken into account in a lot of the judgments that are being made within the Act; and with looking also at whether the adversarial procedures should or could be removed from the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Attorney-General to resolve quickly to get the terms of reference right so that all those people out there in the community who have been asking for so long for this to be dealt with will get the results that they want. Then we can get this inquiry going and ensure that we have a better Family Law Act at the end of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The time has now come, I believe, for Australia to normalise its relations with China. The Australian Government sanctions policy, which has been in place over the past 20 months, should now be ended. The time is ready for constructive dialogue between Australia and China at every level. The opportune time for this Australian initiative was on 1 January 1991, some six weeks ago, but that New Year's Day has now passed and already this week the Chinese new year is passing. I urge the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, who I am glad to see in the chamber this evening, to act now and to act openly and accountably for the sound reasons which I believe are evident and which I will go on to outline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was Australia which imposed sanctions on China and now it must be Australia's decision to remove them. The sanctions were imposed in response to the Beijing massacre on 4 June 1989. The basic facts about the events in and around Tiananmen Square are now consolidated and widely but not universally understood. The sanctions we imposed were soundly based. Certainly they had bipartisan support in this Parliament and support from all elements of the Australian people. These Australian decisions I had myself urged in my own speech here in the Senate on 6 June 1989 when, in part, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Until this past weekend, we in Australia were prepared not to interfere, but to leave Chinese internal decisions to China. But the most recent government decisions and their effects reach far beyond China and they touch us all and we must respond. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time since the late 1970s, the exciting and positive decade or so since the arrest of the Gang of Four, we have seen, at one stroke, the optimism and openness and affection for China and China's development put under the dark shadow of this deadly tragedy in Tiananmen. </PARA>
<PARA> Our pain in Australia at this event must be only a small reflection of the pain of the Chinese people. Theirs is a pain mixed with fear; a pain which saps confidence for the present and hope for the future. We weep along side those in China who weep. Our resolve together is for justice and truth and the truth will set us free. </PARA>
<PARA>A few days later on Friday 9 June I attended, in the front row, the memorial service for those who lost their lives in Beijing held in the Great Hall of this Parliament. The great sorrow we then felt and expressed is still felt and will not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few weeks that followed, sanctions were imposed not only by Australia but also by the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom, the European Community, and the Association of South East Asian Nations-indeed, by most countries in the world. There was not only an end made to ministerial contacts in all areas of government but a freezing of aid programs, an end to defence cooperation, no new credit facilities and an end to World Bank and Asian Development Bank assistance. At the same time, overseas business ventures in China were enormously reduced, many overseas education projects terminated and tourism was decimated. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Australian Government's part, the original sanctions policy was significantly reiterated both after six months and after 12 months had elapsed but in recent months it has been relaxed. For example, the Chinese Minister for Metallurgical Industry, Mr Qi Yuanjing, was allowed to visit the important Channar iron ore mine in Western Australia last May, and the Vice Foreign Minister, Mr Liu Huaqiu, came to Canberra last August to open the new Chinese Embassy. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, Dr Blewett, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, visited Beijing in September for trade talks and Mr Kerin, Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in November to discuss Australian wool and wheat exports. Dr Hewson, Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tim Fischer, Leader of the National Party, Senator Hill, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and myself as chairman of the Opposition's task force on international relations made a much publicised and successful visit to Shanghai and Beijing for wide-ranging talks last September. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition visit included meetings with the General Secretary, Mr Jiang Zemin, and the Premier, Mr Li Peng. Subsequently during October a National Party parliamentary delegation led by Mr Lloyd visited China and during November a Liberal Party parliamentary delegation led by Mr Downer visited China. These delegations were foreshadowed during the Hewson delegation visit.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I visited China again in December and January. As recently as last week there were some other notable visitors to Australia-Mr Rong Yiren, China's leading businessman and, in a separate delegation, Bishop K H Ting, China's leading churchman. Both also hold very senior positions in China's parliamentary bodies-the National Peoples Congress and the Peoples Consultative Congress. I was very glad to have had my own discussions with both of these visitors this past week. During recent months the Australian Government has avoided directly referring to its own sanctions policy, thus leaving the whole area out of the spotlight and ready for change. This development has especially followed the unnecessary remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, in July last year which exposed the untenable and hypocritical position of super vigilance which he then appeared to have adopted. However, the Minister's outburst was not the only occasion for our criticism during this 20-month period of the Australian Government's sanctions policy. Our other criticisms have been more significant. </PARA>
<PARA> The first concerns the 20,000 citizens of the Peoples Republic of China, nearly all of whom are students, who were residents in Australia in June 1989, and for whom the Government has overruled our immigration laws and regulations to allow them, en masse, to remain in Australia pending some clearer determination of their immigration status in the four years to June 1993. My own view, which is the Australian Opposition's publicised position, is that this block 20,000 person extension is quite wrong and that each individual application for a change of immigration status should be considered on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that the undertakings to return to China, which each of the 20,000 made when they came to Australia should, wherever possible, be honoured. It is my view that the students would suffer no penalty on returning to China. On the contrary they would, by returning, serve very well themselves and their own people and at the same time honour the bilateral education agreements between our countries-indeed, restore their credibility. Also, by returning, they would bring their own experience and skill to serve China's economic, social and political development. </PARA>
<PARA> For them to remain in Australia is, in the view of many Australians, a self-indulgence to gain Western material affluence and lifestyle. Only a small minority of the students from China have special humanitarian reasons to jump the queue ahead of the one million applicants Australia considers each year from all over the world and from whom only 120,000 are granted permanent entry and residence in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major criticism which the Opposition has made about the Australian Government concerns the period from August 1990 onwards. We have disagreed with the Government's inflexible aloofness from China and the failure to engage in constructive dialogue with China even about the priority issue of human rights in China. It is our contention that the time had come last September to give our own views directly and frankly to China, including our own concerns, and to listen carefully to China's representatives not only on our concerns but also those concerns which China wanted to put on the agenda. Constructive dialogue would explore the reasons for the distance between us and the remedies needed to be made. There has been both substance and emotion in Australia's 1989-90 distancing from China. All the hurt of a `jilted lover' has contributed to Australia's attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Australia should not forget the many positive elements of the golden decade of the Australia-China relationship, 1979-1988. Also, we need to look ahead to the whole decade of the 1990s and beyond that to the middle of next century. In a comprehensive speech about China which I gave here in the Senate on 10 and 14 December 1987, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia we should think about not only the current year or the next five years, but the next 50 years, and see what historical precedents there are over recent centuries for the emergence of a country with so vast a human resource to escape the 150 years of suffering that I have outlined. The emergence of China, in partnership with Australia and the other Pacific rim countries such as Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada and the United States, will ensure that the Pacific will become the economic centre of gravity for this world in the twenty-first century. I believe that the future lies more and more with an increased Chinese influence in our region, and that region is this important area of the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> I still strongly believe that we should expect and plan for a greatly increased mutual economic prosperity in the relationship between Australia and China. All the opportunities are there. It is very much to Australia's own benefit to take up these opportunities. Certainly, in my recent visits to China in September last year and in January this year I further explored China's economic planning and I am the more convinced that the following benchmarks ought to be more objectively recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, China on 30 December last year adopted proposals for drawing up the eighth Five-Year Plan, 1991-1985, and the Ten-Year Program, 1991-2000, both of which are positive and realistic. We can expect these outlines to be implemented by the National People's Congress when it meets next month. Australia should be appraised of these economic plans right from the outset and be in a position to maximise trade, investment and technology contracts to the mutual benefit of ourselves and the Chinese people. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, China still endorses the October 1987 speech of the then General Secretary, Mr Zhao Ziyang, which set out a new analysis of China's detailed economic and political objectives. The analysis and objectives set out in this speech are still explicitly endorsed by the Party and by the Government and I believe they are still achievable. </PARA>
<PARA> By 2050, the Chinese economy will be in gross terms, but not in per capita terms, the largest national economy in the world. On several occasions last month senior Chinese officials told me that Deng Xiaoping has, without any contradiction, declared that `not one word of Zhao Ziyang's 1987 speech will be altered.' It remains China's economic, political and social orthodoxy. </PARA>
<PARA> May I remind the Senate that this speech, given to the Party Congress, was broadcast on television and radio all over China. It was seen by the ordinary people everywhere as refreshing and inspiring because, in comparison with earlier statements of this kind, the 1987 analysis was so realistic, flexible, comprehensive and practical. It captivated the nation. It put all earlier economic and political programs into its shadow. It outlined the way for China to consolidate the growth during what I have termed the `golden decade' and to go on to achieve the full modernisation of China within the lifetime of today's students. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, China has been chastened by the trauma arising from the Beijing massacre of June 1989. There is a genuine resolve to ensure that these events will never be repeated in China. There is a resolve for stability accompanied by the widening education and political reform necessary to achieve modernisation. There is a resolve to remain permanently open to the outside world. A threshold of awareness has now arrived in China that not only was the Cultural Revolution a disaster never to be repeated but also the Tiananmen tragedy was a disaster never to be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the issue of human rights in China. I believe that sceptical observers-and I include myself-should look beyond the cardboard jargon which over-defensively and unconvincingly asserts the official line that the Tiananmen issue is a matter `internal to China' and about which foreign nations and individuals should not interfere. Rather, it is clear that the great majority of Chinese officials, those with intelligence and ears to hear, have felt from the beginning the horror and rebuke of the Tiananmen events. Moreover, they are genuinely aware of the world's reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the officials have heard the same message but even more dramatically from the ordinary Chinese people themselves, including their own sons and daughters and the people in the villages and the people in the city streets. It is my observation, for example, that the 13 million people of Shanghai, from top to bottom, hold in contempt the Beijing Government and military apparatus that allowed the Tiananmen disaster to occur. Shanghai, the most prosperous and progressive city in China, has nothing more to learn from Australia's sanctions policy. Their own resolution about the matter is already stronger than ours and it will be more effective. After all, it is their own country they are concerned to get right. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant example is Chengdu, the capital of the 100 million strong province of Sichuan. Here the provincial officials in May 1989 identified themselves with the anticorruption accountability and freedom goals of the demonstrating students. These were among the students all over China who were moved by the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989 to stand up and vigorously support the principles that Hu had so significantly espoused. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chengdu, the anarchy and disarray that occurred arose on 5 and 6 June. The news then from Beijing, which was also mixed with some alarming and false reports, whipped up a very angry demonstration. Some people, who perhaps thought they were helping the students at this time, burnt down the people's cinema and the people's market, two prominent buildings on opposite sides of a major intersection in central Chengdu. However, this enormous vandalism was seen as such by the people, students and government alike, who were horrified by these losses. As a result, the demonstration completely ceased. That was the end of it. Fewer than 30 persons were charged, tried and convicted for destruction of property. No-one was shot; no-one has been imprisoned for holding a political view. In Chengdu, there are no unresolved matters arising from June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The third example is Chongqing, the major city of the south-west. Here the authorities cooperated with the students and actually cleared the traffic whenever a demonstration was held. Some particular government representatives spoke so convincingly in support of the students' original concerns that no difficulties ever arose. There were no injuries and no arrests in Chongqing. Further examples can be cited: in the south, Kunming; in the centre, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Wuhan; and in the north, Harbin, Shenyang and Dalian. All of these are cities that I have recently visited. The students marched but there were no disturbances, no fighting and no arrests; in fact, the people, the students and the Government had the same reaction of horror at the Beijing events of 4 June, and this reaction effectively meant an end to all these activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become very clear that the offensiveness of the 4 June crackdown was 90 per cent restricted to Beijing. The horror of it all was the massacre that happened in Beijing. There were no massacres anywhere else in China; there are no unresolved matters arising from these events anywhere else in China. Only in Beijing are there some unconcluded and controversial developments. However, these remaining matters are now in the process of finally being resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> In my recent visits I have travelled to all the cities mentioned and I have asked questions of many people. I have also reviewed again videos of the June events in Beijing and Chengdu. I have read most of the articles and books that are available about these events, both by the Chinese writers and by overseas diplomats and journalists. Over the past 20 months I have listened carefully to the assessments of informed Australian observers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Beijing massacre occurred on the night of 3 June and the morning of 4 June when the Chinese Army shot many people on the major approach roads to the centre of Beijing. The best estimate is that about 1,000 people were killed by the soldiers shooting. The soldiers' guns were aimed comprehensively at any person in sight on the approach roads to Tiananmen. In addition, about 100 soldiers were killed, most of these by mob violence in the few days preceding 4 June; in fact, it was largely in reaction to these earlier soldiers' deaths that the advancing Army columns were ordered to clear the way to Tiananmen. It also partly explains why these advancing Army columns in the pre-dawn hours of 4 June were so desperately violent. About 1,200 Army vehicles and public buses had already been destroyed by the crowds before the guns were fired; mostly they were burnt by mob violence in the few days preceding 4 June. These were the vehicles which contributed to the road blocks set up on the approach roads to Tiananmen. </PARA>
<PARA> Paradoxically, very few students, if any, who were in Tiananmen Square itself were actually killed because the students withdrew to the south of the square in the final hours before the Army columns arrived. It is even possibly true that no-one was actually killed in Tiananmen Square itself. In any event, there is no evidence that tanks rolled back and forth over the bodies of the hunger-striking students in the square. No evidence has ever been presented to substantiate this allegation which was given wide publicity in Australia on 9 June. </PARA>
<PARA> What did happen from 4 June onwards is this: the vast amount of material left by the students in the square, including their tent city, was bulldozed and burnt. In addition to the 1,000 people who died in Beijing, there were many more who suffered injuries. Some of these and many others were arrested in the weeks following 4 June, and those arrested were then investigated pending charges being laid for subsequent trial in the courts. It appears that at least 900 persons were arrested for investigation. In the 12 months that followed, some 880 of these were released, many of them in January and May 1990. Some in fact were released at an earlier stage without any charges being made against them. Others suspected of various actual crimes, including the destruction of property, were released for lack of sufficient evidence to convict or for having served a sufficient period of detention to fit the punishment set down by law for these actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month, on 5 January, the results of the first trials were announced in newspapers and news broadcasts all over China. Eight persons had been in court charged with specific unlawful actions: two were acquitted and released; the other six were sentenced to two years or four years detention. I was told by officials in Beijing that these trials followed normal legal process and that no-one was charged for merely holding a particular political opinion, but only for an action prohibited by law and for which there was sufficient evidence to convict. Those charged had legal representation and the trials were conducted with some public witnesses attending, including family members of the accused. Of course, these trials do `fall far short of international standards', as Amnesty International stated last week. The trials are not fully open to the public, nor are they able to be observed by journalists or diplomats. These omissions, unfortunately, are the common practice in many countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I was further told that no-one is detained in Beijing merely for holding political opinions. I was told, quite credibly, that to do otherwise would only repeat the grave mistakes of the Cultural Revolution period. Moreover, the then victims of these grave mistakes are in many cases the officials now responsible for administering these procedures. However, this distinction is not entirely black and white. A grey area remains. It appears that some of the charges currently directed against the relatively few remaining detainees amount to accusations of political action unacceptable to the Government. Whilst political action is a step beyond political thought, it is not at all clear that the action involved was in itself criminal. This issue of course has for centuries been the controversy about accusations of treason. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked repeatedly to be told how many students and how many other persons are still being detained. I was never given an exact number. The answer I was eventually given was that it was a relatively small number. I am convinced that the number is limited to Beijing and that the exact number is not publicly available. No reason for this unnecessary secrecy was ever suggested to me. Several officials did tell me that all persons detained were charged with criminal actions and all are to be tried by due legal process. It is usual for all charged persons to be legally represented, the family members are allowed to attend the trial, and the concluded outcome is made public. </PARA>
<PARA> My final observation is this: I had until this evening had the expectation that all the remaining court proceedings would be concluded by June 1991-that is, by two years after the original events-but I did not have any guarantee of this. However, it is now my understanding this evening that some radio reports from China today appear to have announced that all the outstanding trials are now completed, with the sentences in these last trials being six years up to 13 years. I certainly hope that the trials are in fact concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the evidence from June 1989 and at the deaths, the casualties and the arrests, it is very clear that there was a massacre in Beijing. Moreover, there has never been a massacre like it in Beijing's entire history. Of the many massacres suffered by the Chinese people during the many centuries of dynastic history, none was in Beijing-whether by the invading Mongols, Manchus, Japanese, at the hands of the warlords, in uprisings, in the civil war of the 1940s, or even in the relief of the foreign embassies from the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. Beijing itself has never before seen killing like that of 1989. Naturally it has traumatised Beijing and the trauma is still being felt. It is not now felt anywhere else in China but it is felt in Beijing. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas there is an ease to talk about the June 1989 events in the other cities of China, there is not this ease in Beijing. The trauma is not far below the consciousness of the people everywhere in Beijing. Ironically, it is also seen in the ineffective defensiveness and immature bravado of a minority of senior leaders. It is at the heart of the present lack of coherence in China's leadership. I hope it will not be many months before the robust unity and fully convincing sense of direction returns to China's national leadership in much the same way that it has already returned in Shanghai and in the other regional centres of China. </PARA>
<PARA> The major observation I wish to add here is this: the people and leaders of Beijing do not now need foreigners to keep on telling them what they very well know already. They are no longer being any further moved by our sanctions policy; they have already been moved a hundred times more by their own people and by their own sense of horror and loss. Does anyone in this Australian Parliament really think that it is only because we have been prodding them from overseas that the Chinese people have felt the suffering of the Beijing events of June 1989? How patronising and self-righteous that would be. Also, how ignorant that would be of the Chinese people's sense for what is right and just. I seek leave to have the next three paragraphs of my speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Most of the Leaders whom I met in Beijing last month, and some last September, could not be described as defensive or immature or heartless in their evaluation of these matters. The majority of the officials I have met remain close to the people and responsive to the people. The foundations of their thinking show an intelligent and responsive grasp of this enormous trauma even if there is a very inadequate public resolution of and public explanation of these events. The Chinese do not need foreign observers to point this out to them when their own people are crying out for a convincing explanation of why the People's Army shot the people. The Chinese don't need our consciences now, they already have consciences of their own. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an enduring patience in the Chinese people that an actual explanation and just resolution will eventually emerge. This patience baffles many in the West and appears cowardly or supine to some. But, for example, the Lin Biao affair of 1971 with all its hypocrisy and secrecy was eventually resolved. Even Mao's mistakes were eventually resolved after his death. The mistakes of the Red Guards have been exposed and resolved: the `ten lost years' of the Cultural Revolution were eventually brought to an end by the 1976 arrest of the Gang of Four. And, remark- ably then, as if pent up for all those ten years, the people all over China rose up and celebrated all night exploding all the available firecrackers and drinking all the available wine. The dark shadow of fear over China had been lifted. The point I wish to make is this: in not one of these examples did the resolution actually depend on any foreign intervention. Not one of these victories for popular justice came about because of sanctions imposed by overseas countries. Perhaps this is the factually correct aspect of the overdrawn claim that such matters as these are ``internal to China''. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In conclusion, I wish to summarise the case I am arguing by referring to eight significant reasons why the Australian Government should now end its sanctions policy and normalise Australia's relations with China. Firstly, the objectives of the sanctions policy have already been achieved. Mostly this achievement has been the response to internal pressures from the people of China themselves. There is no turning back now for China's open-door policy and the priority of effective economic and political development of China. In any event, let us avoid the foolishness of thinking that the Chinese need our consciences when they already have sensitive consciences of their own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, those remaining matters in China which raise objections for Australians-and there are significant remaining objections, such as the failure, to date, to allow journalists and diplomats to attend the trials-will be much more effectively pursued by our direct dialogue with China on the basis of resuming normal relations. Thirdly, the resumption of normal relations does not mean that we have forgotten the horror of the Beijing massacre any more than our building normal relations after 1976 meant that we had forgotten the fear, the abuses and the wasted opportunities of the Cultural Revolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, we should not fail to remember the positive strengths and advantages of the Australia-China relationship in the golden decade preceding 1989. We should now work to see another decade, the 1990s, build on that established track record and expand anew. In the words of Dr Hewson last September, our vision ought to be the resolution of each country's concerns and the threefold expansion by the year 2000 of our economic relations to the mutual benefit of both countries. Fifthly, now is the opportune time to begin again the expansion of our economic relations. China is about to launch its eighth Five-Year Plan and Australia should be engaged from the outset to maximise trade, investment and technology contracts to the mutual benefit of both countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, Australia should, as in much of the 1980s, actually set the pace internationally for China's relations. Already Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have opened some financial doors. Already the foreign Ministers of Europe, of some Asian countries-even Indonesia-have opened some diplomatic doors. Australia should be the first country to drop sanctions and achieve normal relations. We should lead the rest of the world by our own actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Seventhly, the past few months have demonstrated the significant role China holds in the United Nations (UN), especially as a permanent member of the Security Council. The Gulf, Cambodia, the shape of the post-Cold War world are all significant international issues where China has begun to make a constructive contribution. China's participation in recent UN decision making has begun to take into account the views of Australia and other nations. We would want China to receive Australia's views positively, and this will be more effectively achieved by returning Australia-China relations to normal. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Australia has professed to have a special relationship with China. Perhaps because of that we reacted with all the more honesty and conviction in June 1989. If we do have a special relationship, a similar honesty and conviction are called for now to return to direct constructive dialogue and to prove that our remaining difficulties can be addressed and solved. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know. I want to talk briefly about the finding of the Resource Assessment Commission with respect to the Kakadu conservation zone. Without making the obvious observation-that is, that it has achieved absolutely nothing in terms of its definitive findings and in matters of fact-I find the conclusions of the Commission thoroughly astounding in a number of respects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It finds that the Jawoyn people are opposed to mining at Coronation Hill, and it finds an intrinsic link between the land areas in the conservation zone, the Coronation Hill area particularly, and the Jawoyn people. Frankly, that flies in the face of all the evidence of substance thus far discovered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission makes the observation that with respect to the Coronation Hill area three people are judged to be the senior elders. One is Mr Peter Jatbula; the second is Mr Sandy Barraway; and the third is Mr Nipper Brown. It is the claim of the Commission that these three senior elders are opposed to mining Coronation Hill. I say to the Commission frankly that I find that conclusion to be absolutely astonishing. </PARA>
<PARA> During the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into the potential of Kakadu National Park, the Committee took very deliberate evidence from those three witnesses. It was taken in a very informal, relaxed way, providing every opportunity for those elders to articulate their views about mining Coronation Hill. Nipper Brown quite properly identified himself as the senior elder. I asked him in clear terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Are you happy for BHP to explore on Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA>Nipper Brown responded:</PARA>
<PARA>We are all happy if they go ahead and explore for gold or anything like that. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>So mining on Coronation Hill would not hurt Aboriginal sites?</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It can go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>I responded:</PARA>
<PARA>Is that one, Coronation Hill, okay?</PARA>
<PARA>Nipper Brown said:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked earlier whether there was a sacred site on Coronation Hill. Nipper Brown said:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing. It is free. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Did some people make a mistake and think that Coronation Hill was a sacred site?</PARA>
<PARA>Nipper Brown said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is free. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer is clear and undisguised. It is a commitment under oath in articulate English that mining could and should proceed with his support on Coronation Hill. Further evidence was taken from Barraway, the other elder referred to by the Commission. He gave quite unqualified evidence, firstly, that he had never applied for a sacred site on Coronation Hill and, secondly, that he supported mining in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission, under Justice Stewart, seeks to set aside that evidence by asserting the following when referring to statements:</PARA>
<PARA>Others were made in situations of some pressure, such as the appearance of the men before a Senate Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>With respect, that is thoroughly untrue and it reeks of impertinence. Being on the Committee and being present, I am well aware of the environment and the circumstances in which that evidence was given. It is thoroughly presumptuous for the Commission to dismiss out of hand that evidence on the basis of its assumption and presumption that the evidence was given under some sort of pressure. Frankly, in a very impertinent way the Commissioner goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There may have been times when the responses of the senior Jawoyn men to questions about Coronation Hill and their views about mining were a reflection of their internal struggle to find an appropriate balance between religious and material imperatives. When subjected to pressure from outside sources, it is not surprising that they sometimes expressed what appeared to be contradictory views. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commissioner said that they were agonising between the morality of their religion, the fundamental spiritual beliefs and the offer of money, and that is why there were contradictions. In other words, some of the time they were telling the truth and the rest of the time they were being expedient. I do not know what evidence the Commission took to justify that assertion, but as one who took evidence from those people I found their integrity impeccable, their responses articulate and their understandings precise. Their knowledge of the questions was crystal clear and the environment one of thorough confidence and relaxation. </PARA>
<PARA> We made a point of ensuring that no press and no members of the public were allowed in. It was a very informal meeting around a circular table. Yet that evidence-clear, unqualified, specific and to the point-is dismissed by the Commission as evidence given, first, under pressure because they were before a Senate committee and, secondly, because they were agonising over telling the truth about their spiritual relationship with the land and the financial imperatives. If that is the basis of the conclusions drawn by the Commission in respect of that matter, I have grave concerns about the rest of the findings. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter is the intrinsic spiritual relationship between the Jawoyn people, Coronation Hill and, to wit, the conservation zone. In an application for land rights by the Jawoyn people, a hearing before Justice Kearney, areas 4 and 5, which abut Kakadu National Park and which are in the proximity of South Alligator River, were dismissed by Justice Kearney. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The two senior claimants who spoke with knowledge of Areas 4 and 5-</PARA>
<PARA>these applications for land rights were the closest to Coronation Hill-</PARA>
<PARA>Peter Jatbula and Sandy Barraway-</PARA>
<PARA>these are two of the three elders referred to by the commissioners as having the authority-</PARA>
<PARA>did not convey an impression of interest in those areas or of any strong attachment to them. While several sites in the vicinity of Areas 4 and 5 were named and their associated Dreamings identified, no evidence to establish common spiritual affiliations by the claimants to those sites or the performance of spiritual responsibilities for those sites was given in either open or closed sessions of the enquiry. At transcript p.1156 Dr Merlan-</PARA>
<PARA>note: Dr Merlan-</PARA>
<PARA>considered that the Jawoyn were exercising primary spiritual responsibility for Bekluk (No. 17, Q2) on Area 4 and Gunlom (No. 86, K2) on Area 5; however, the basis of that opinion was not stated and I do not give it any weight. </PARA>
<PARA>That was evidence given by Dr Merlan, who was the consultant engaged by the Commission to provide expert evidence. Justice Kearney went on to say in respect of those two areas:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the traditional evidence put forward in relation to Areas 4 and 5 is insufficient to enable any finding to be made that the members of that group (or any group, for that matter) are the traditional Aboriginal owners of those areas, within the meaning of the Act. While there are sites on both areas and Dreamings to which the Jawoyn have links, for example, through the travelling Dreamings Gupu (Kangaroo) . . . the existence of common spiritual affiliations to sites on Areas 4 and 5 or to sites which can be linked with those areas, is not established; nor is there evidence of a strong traditional attachment to Areas 4 and 5. Accordingly, the claim to Areas 4 and 5 fails. </PARA>
<PARA>He says that there is no spiritual link, no intrinsic link, and there is no clear relationship. This judgment was made by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 before the Land Rights Commissioner who took evidence exclusively in order to make those assessments. Yet the Commission, in a prosecution of another term of reference, dismisses the findings by saying that the terms of reference of Justice Kearney were not relevant to the relationship between the Aboriginal community and the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, that is absolute bunkum. If they cannot claim a land right, what is the measure, the test, of their relationship with the land which allows them an opportunity to negotiate with BHP Gold, as it then was, for royalties? What is their claim which allows them to have a say in whether mining ought to proceed? What is their claim, upon which the Commissioner makes a judgment, in respect of whether or not mining ought to proceed? Clearly, it is something other than that which can be found at law. The Committee took evidence from a Ms Wynjorroc and Ms Flora. Both of them gave clear, unqualified evidence. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crichton-Browne: Would you be happy for there to be mining on Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Wynjorroc: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>Ms Flora: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>Ms Wynjorroc: It is okay on that land. </PARA>
<PARA>Ms Wynjorroc went on to make some other claims that there was no Bula site, no sacred site, on Coronation Hill. It is not without significance to note in respect to the land claim application that substantial evidence was taken by Mr Justice Kearney from those two women. He relied upon their evidence as expert evidence and was proud enough to publish photographs of both the women throughout the report. Both those women said that there were no sacred sites or areas of significance. In fact, Eva Valley, which is to the south of Coronation Hill, was referred to in the report. Justice Kearney says:</PARA>
<PARA>The claimants stated what was not Jawoyn country as emphatically as they stated what was their country. For example, when Willy Bye-</PARA>
<PARA>who is also an elder of some standing-</PARA>
<PARA>was describing the extent and the borders of Jawoyn territory he remarked of Eva Valley:</PARA>
<PARA> We got nothing to do with them fellows. That is Mayali. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an area of another Aboriginal community. Eva Valley is further to the south than Coronation Hill. Yet we are now being persuaded by the Commission that this is an area of significance. The Land Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA>Sandy Barraway-</PARA>
<PARA>referred to as one of the authorities-</PARA>
<PARA>provided a fairly complete outline of Jawoyn country, referring to sites, European and Aboriginal place names and the countries of bordering Aboriginal groups. By his account, Mayali country is to the north of the Jawoyn, in the vicinity of the South Alligator River . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody knows better than Senator Gareth Evans where Coronation Hill is-South Alligator River; not in the Jawoyn country, according to the findings of Justice Kearney. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the findings of the Resource Assessment Commission, which was seeking to resolve the conflict, in its inclination to believe that the Jawoyn people were opposed to mining, and having regard to the compelling evidence given under oath before a Senate committee, was:</PARA>
<PARA>In this respect, the Inquiry has found that the discussion paper prepared by Mr Robert Levitus and appended to the submission of the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (Submission 77) is of great assistance in understanding Jawoyn people's evolving attitudes to the mining question. </PARA>
<PARA>There was nothing evolving about the attitude of the Jawoyn people in their evidence to us. But what is of significance is that the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority was deeply and subjectively involved in seeking to persuade the Jawoyn people that mining in the Kakadu region, the Coronation Hill region, was wrong and bad. It makes no secret of the fact that it went to a number of meetings of the Jawoyn people and harangued them and sought to persuade them not to agree to negotiate with BHP, not to agree to any mining, and yet they are now held up as authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> There is reference to Mr Cooper. Mr Cooper gave evidence to our Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. He was so emotionally involved, it was difficult to distinguish between fiction and fact in his evidence. In respect to those two matters I find it remarkable that the Commission finds in the way it does. If I were a less charitable man, I would draw the conclusion that it was trying to find facts to fit its findings. On page 110, when referring to the economic advantage to the Aboriginal community, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Royalty and other revenues that might flow from the Coronation Hill project to Jawoyn and other Aboriginal people have the potential to deliver positive benefits-</PARA>
<PARA>then it qualifies the matter-</PARA>
<PARA>but realisation of these benefits depends on the establishment of sound management structures and access to good financial advice. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that remarkable. In the case of Koongarra, if mining is ever to proceed under this Government-and we know that it will not; it will take the next or another-they are entitled to receive $256m in royalties. Already, if my calculations are correct, the Aboriginal community that lays claim to the area which contains the Ranger uranium mine has received $50m in royalties. Nobody is claiming that they need some special managers. There is no qualification about the benefits that they are receiving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two other quick matters I will touch upon. I do not speak unkindly about the anthropologists who acted as consultants on this occasion, but this seems a quaint way of doing business. The Resource Assessment Commission engaged, as best I am able to understand, Dr Merlan and it refers to her evidence in an authoritative way as explaining the contradictions in respect of the sickness country. I must say that what is now described as the `sickness country' by the Northern Territory Sacred Sites Authority seems to be a new phenomenon which has appeared in the last three decades.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clapped out buffalo country, as it was articulately and precisely referred to by Senator Evans. Dr Merlan is in the unique position of identifying sacred sites in the conservation zone. The Aborigines registered them with her assistance because she found the sites for them and she then gave evidence to the Sacred Sites Authority for their registration. Then when an application for land rights was made, she gave expert evidence that they were sacred sites. I would have thought that in normal circumstances that would be a conflict of evidence. But we have a potential situation where Dr Merlan finds a sacred site and then gives evidence on a land claim that it is a sacred site. That is hardly the best way of doing business, yet it seems to me that the Commission fell into the same trap of using that as expert advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, there is an assertion in this report that there is little benefit in terms of work for the Aboriginal community. If my memory serves me correctly, when we in the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts did our report there were a minimum of 13 Jawoyn people engaged on site and 65 others who were seeking employment. My distinct impression was that there was overwhelming support. If a plebiscite had been conducted-that is not the way that the Aboriginal community does business-I feel that there would have been a strong expression by the Jawoyn people in support of mining at Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of the hour and the education of Senator Evans, who presumably wants to go home and watch the late night news, I will not keep the Senate a great deal longer other than to say that on page 24 of volume 2 the Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA>Keen and Merlan-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Dr Merlan to whom I previously referred-</PARA>
<PARA>reviewed the circumstances in which these apparently contradictory statements were made.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission was referring to the fact that the elders had told the Senate Standing Committee in a clear and articulate way, as I said, that they supported mining, but that they told the Authority-aided, abetted, intimidated and threatened in all sorts of ways, I suspect, by the Northern Territory Sacred Sites Authority-they did not. The Commission had Keen and Merlan review the circumstances. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>They suggest that some of the statements may have been responses to situations of substantial pressure or fear and that others may be responses to questions that are poorly understood or poorly phrased for people who speak English as a second language . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am not going to retrace the simple four-word, one syllable questions that I asked, but Nipper Brown had no difficulty understanding me when he was asked the very simple question: is Coronation Hill free? He said yes. I asked whether it was free? He said that there was nothing there and mining was okay. I said during the hearing that it should not be thought that there was an atmosphere of officialdom in this hearing. I asked whether everybody was quite relaxed, whether everybody felt comfortable answering the questions, whether they would like an adjournment, whether they all understood the question. The witnesses all nodded vigorously and said that they were quite relaxed. Yet we were told by Merlan that it was because of perhaps substantial pressure in some cases or because the responses were to questions poorly understood. That is simply not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall pursue the balance of my concerns about this report at a later stage, but suffice it to say that the Resource Assessment Commission has been a waste of time. I now have grave doubts about the integrity of the findings and the validity of the manner in which the Commission went in pursuit of its findings. I have no doubt that on the matters of which I have knowledge the Commission's report is fundamentally wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most substantial contribution tonight, with the utmost respect to Senator Crichton-Browne-particularly after his flash remark just then-was that of Senator Teague on the subject of China. It was an interesting contribution to what is an ongoing debate in this country. I will read both it and the more extensive paper which I know Senator Teague has prepared on this topic with close attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make clear to him that the issue of our relationship with China is not one about which the Government has been cavalier or indifferent. I think it is unfortunate that he marred his presentation tonight by his characterisation of the Government's behaviour in relation to China after Tiananmen, or the Beijing massacre, as that of a jilted lover. The truth of the matter is that Australia's reaction, while emotional, was no more so than that of most other countries around the world which did react with horror to the violence that occurred on that occasion and which regarded it then, as now, as totally indefensible. I think it does trivialise that reaction to describe it in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, I do not think it is fair to describe the measures which we took-in common with so many other countries-to convey our displeasure of the situation as being patronising, self-righteous or, indeed, unproductive for Australia to join in as part of a world wide-or, at least, Western country wide-response to what was a most unhappy situation. It was always part of the Australian response to maintain lines of communication and access to China. The breach in our relations has never been absolute, and deliberately so because we acknowledge the force of many of the points that Senator Teague made in his contribution tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The downgrading of aspects of the relationship was not intended to be permanent. That was made clear in 1989 and, again, at the time of subsequent reviews that have been the subject of later public announcements. Nor is it intended now that the restrictions that are presently in place will go on forever. More than that, we are, in fact, giving close consideration right now to their continued application. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from questions of defence sales, visits by security officials and so on, which will no doubt go on being very sensitive for a good deal longer yet, the particular restrictions in the relationship to which we are presently giving close attention are the suspended procedures for consideration for technical cooperation and agricultural research projects; the suspended consideration of the availability of new concessional finance for development assistance projects; and, of course, the question of parliamentary and formal party visits in respect of which the Government policy has continued to apply fairly stringent limitations, albeit ones that have been more honoured in the breach than in the observance by the Opposition side of politics in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering all these matters, it is very difficult to apply absolute considerations. To deal in any absolute way with the situations we confront is always a matter of drawing an appropriate balance between competing demands, competing objectives. It is always a matter of judgment as to how these responses should be applied, taking into account the nature of our relationship, the nature of the great issues of principle that are involved and, among other things, the nature of the reaction of other like-minded countries, and I can assure Senator Teague that all these things are being very closely considered at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters that is always relevant in considering these kinds of issues is the question of timing. It is the case, as Senator Teague himself acknowledged in his speech, that that is a particularly sensitive matter at the moment with a number of remaining trials either taking place or just concluded in Beijing. That is something that the Government, again, will need to bring into account in its deliberations on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I say no more than that. This is an appropriate matter for serious policy debate in this place. The Government has never sought to trivialise that and it has never been insensitive to the need to think very carefully about the way in which we handle these aspects of our relationship. Having said all of that, I suggest, Mr President, that it is now more than time for the Senate to adjourn. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA>Senate adjourned at 12.15 a.m. (Wednesday)</PARA>
