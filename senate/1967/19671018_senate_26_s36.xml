            <para>- It is a fact that there is a misunderstanding. Certain requirements have been spelled out in the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act. I think it would be proper in all the circumstances for me to ask that the question be put on the notice paper so that we may get a considered reply in depth from the Minister for Civil Aviation. I ask that that be done. There is quite clearly a misunderstanding on the part of many people in relation to this matter. </para>

The fact that the report appeared in that particular newspaper does not necessarily mean that the details given are correct. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate has just informed the Senate, considerable work is being done to meet the request for papers relating to flights by VIP aircraft to be tabled in the Senate. Any information that can be made available lo the Senate will be made available when those papers are tabled. </para>

Can the Minister give an indication of the progress on the Centre and when it is likely to be completed? Will the range of appliances to be made there be an extension of those already being produced elsewhere? My next query refers to a question that I have asked earlier of the Minister. Will the new Centre be used for training courses for people undertaking the manufacture of artificial limbs and appliances? Can the Minister give any figures showing the quantity of appliances and artificial limbs that are likely to be produced at the Centre and the number of persons who will be employed there? </para>

            <para>- It is true that I took advantage of an opportunity on Monday last to visit the almost completed repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centre at Adelaide. The Centre will cost about $140,000. It will be the most modern artificial limb factory in Australia. Until now the artificial limb factory at Hollywood, in Western Australia, has been the outstanding centre of its kind, but I am quite convinced that the new Centre at Adelaide will be more modern and even better than the Hollywood centre. As to training courses, this will depend on whether the people who need training will be available in Adelaide. Otherwise I would imagine that these people would be trained in the artificial limb factories in the States where they reside. Last year the artificial limb factory in Adelaide supplied 10S legs, 738 articles of surgical footwear and 91 items of adapted footwear. Other surgical 2,605 repairs were effected. It might be of interest to honourable senators to know that the total output of the repatriation artificial limb factories last year was 18,042 items, appliances totalling 809 were supplied and </para>

Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn also to another article which appeared in Melbourne Truth&#39; of 1.4th October last in which it was claimed that while public relations officers of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Department of External Affairs are transported to and from Vietnam by luxury jet aircraft, wounded servicemen being brought back from Vietnam travel in noisy, slow Lockheed Hercules transport aircraft? If this allegation is correct, will the Government take steps to see that wounded servicemen are provided with the same form of comfortable transport as is provided for unwounded public relations officers? If the allegation is not correct, will the Government deny it? </para>

            <para>-  Questions were asked a few months ago about the transportation of wounded servicemen from Vietnam. Following those questions, one of our top medical men, who, 1 think, was an Army officer, accompanied some of our wounded servicemen in one of these Hercules aircraft. As a result of this trip, he formed the opinion that the aircraft now being used are the best types for the purpose. </para>

              <para>-  It is not a matter of whether the honourable senator agrees with him. There are not very many people who agree with the honourable senator. The officer to whom I refer would not be holding the position he does unless he was a very highly qualified man. 1 would not imagine that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> has had the opportunity of travelling with these wounded servicemen. The important point is that the position has been looked at. Reference has been made to public relations officers travelling in what have been termed luxurious aircraft. I would imagine that the only other form of transport would be that provided by the normal commercial airline operators. </para>

Has the Minister been made cognisant of the views of the councils of rural towns and cities, and of individuals who, in country areas, have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars towards the purchase, establishment and upkeep of their local aerodromes? Will the Minister give the- Senate an assurance that there will be a differentia&#93; in the charge to be made for passengers flying into and out of country airports? </para>

            <para>- Quite clearly, I could not give the assurance for which the honourable senator asks because his question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. I can say, generally, however, that the details of the scheme for passenger service charges are still being worked out and will be considered by the Government when they have been finalised. All factors relating to rural aerodromes will be taken into account by the Government when it considers the proposed charges. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Air. Last week I tried to obtain an Air Force order. I think it was No. 736. I am not sure of the number, but the Minister will know it. He will remember that I went to his office and asked his staff whether I could have a copy of this order. Both the staff and the Minister told me that the document was unobtainable. My memory has not served me correctly. Was it because the information was classified or restricted, or was if merely a case of sheer obstinacy? </para>

The Minister came to mc himself and said: &#39;I am sorry, I cannot get this order for you. It is unobtainable&#39;. I am not certain whether he said it was classified or restricted.

Will the Minister institute investigations into this complaint?

            <para>- This is my final question regarding VIP aircraft. It is directed to the Leader of the Government while the matter T am about to raise is fresh in his memory and he will not have to send for the papers. For the general edification of the very interested public will he explain the reason for which he used a VIP plane to travel to Launceston and Burnie? This would be as good an example as any of the use of such aircraft. What was the purpose of the Minister&#39;s trip? How many were in the crew? How many passengers travelled with him? What was the designation of each passenger? At what time did he leave Melbourne and at what time did he leave Burnie? </para>

            <para>- I shall bc delighted to supply the information for which the honourable senator has asked on the understanding that I am speaking to the very best of my recollection. I used the plane concerned to attend the Launceston Show, having been invited to be a member of the official party for the opening ceremony: Unfortunately I missed out getting on to the official stand because I was having lunch at the time. That was the purpose of the first engagement. The second engagement was a meeting being held in Burnie. It was not a political meeting or a meeting ot any political party. It was a joint meeting of groups of people who were interested in State schools, in independent schools and in education generally to discuss education and also employment opportunities. I was invited to attend the meeting. This is a continuing organisation, and I gather that at its next meeting it will be addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson,</inline> the Minister for Education in Tasmania. The meeting that 1 attended was a public meeting. I think, of some public importance. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I did not leave Melbourne. I left Canberra at approximately 10.30 a.m. Canberra time. 1 arrived in Launceston, to go to the Show, at approximately 12.30 p.m. Tasmanian time, which is now different from Eastern Standard Time. I then drove to Burnie for the meeting to which I have referred, lt finished at about 10.30 or 10.45 p.m. Tasmanian time. I left at about 11.30 p.m. Tasmanian time, saved an hour on the way back, and arrived back at about midnight. I. was able to be in my office first thing, or relatively first thing - 1 think it was about 10 o&#39;clock - the next morning. If I had not used this aircraft, either I would have been unable to attend those engagements or 1 would have had to leave Canberra on the Wednesday morning and 1 would have arrived back late on the Friday afternoon. </para>

            <para>-  Is the Minister for Housing aware that last week a municipal council in Sydney - the Blacktown Municipal Council - approved of the establishment and development of what is described in official language as a hazardous, offensive and obnoxious chemical factory on 70 acres of land comparatively adjacent to which are many homes which have been erected in recent years and which are occupied and being purchased through the War Service Homes Division by exservicemen who have moved to this area for health reasons? Will the Minister investigate this matter and see whether the report is correct, whether there is likely to be any deleterious effect on the health of the ex-servicemen concerned as a result of the establishment of the factory, and also what effect the construction and operation of the factory is likely to have on the values of the properties being purchased by these ex-servicemen through the War Service Homes Division? </para>

              <para>- The Minister for Health has furnished the following reply: 1 and 2. My attention has been drawn to statements by the Premier of Victoria relating to the present arrangements under which the Commonwealth pays $5 a day towards the cost of providing free treatment in public wards of public hospitals for pensioners. These arrangements are neither &#39;a racket&#39; nor &#39;a confidence trick&#39;. </para>

          <para>The Commonwealth has never intended at any stage to meet the full cost of the treatment of pensioners in public wards of public hospitals. The cost of treating this section of the community has traditionally been the responsibility of the State governments. Prior to 1946 pensioners generally received free treatment in public hospitals, entirely at the expense of the State governments. </para>
          <para>However, the Commonwealth now assists the States in this regard in order that pensioners may be relieved of the necessity to pay hospital insurance but may still receive free public ward treatment. </para>
          <para>Payments by the Commonwealth during the year 1966-67 for the treatment of pensioner patients in public wards of public hospitals amounted to $18.7m of which $4.2m was paid to public hospitals in Victoria. </para>

There were also 4,084 suspected cases of plague, including 158 deaths. 2 and 3. Neither I nor the officers of my Department have yet seen this statement However, inquiries are being made and the statement will be studied when it is received. I should mention that all persons arriving in Australia from overseas are subjected to quarantine screening for disease, including plague. In addition, strict measures are taken to prevent the entry of plague with rats and other animal vectors. These measures have proved to be highly effective over many years, but I can assure the honourable senator that quarantine procedures are under constant review in the light of changing circumstances and the incidence of diseases, including plague, in other countries. </para>

            <para>As a matter of Government policy, surgical aids are not at present issued under the national health scheme. However, the Commonwealth provides considerable assistance to patients who have undergone colostomy operations by supplying as pharmaceutical benefits a range of sprays, creams, solutions, powder and surgical cement which these patients are required to use constantly for their conditions. I understand that in most States there is an association through which colostomy patients can obtain appliances at reduced rates. </para>

              <para>The Tipperary Land Corporation acquired by private purchase Pastoral Lease No. 562 (Tipperary Station). This has an area of 3,560 square miles. 2.The lease was renewed for 50 years from 1st July 1960 at a Crown rental of $2,136 per annum. The rental is based on a valuation of the lease as pastoral lands and is re-appraised every 10 years. Recent amendments to the Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance require that lands within a pastoral lease developed for agricultural purposes be valued and re-appraised as agricultural lands. Pastoral Lease No. 562 will be reappraised on 1st July 1970. 3 and 4. Tipperary Station was established about 1920. The proposed development of part of the lease by the new owners is in line with trends&#39; throughout Australia to put suitable rural lands to more productive use. The dominant fauna of the area is the agile wallaby. Past experience has shown that clearing and sowing of crops and pastures encourages the increase of this species. Tipperary is not the preferred habitat of the buffalo and only a few are found in this area. Production of cattle will still be the main activity over most of the area which will remain uncleared. </para>

          <para class="block">I believe that it is particularly appropriate to bring this proposal before the Senate today because this week is being celebrated throughout Australia as National Equal Pay Week. There may be some misconception in the minds of a lot of people as to what is really meant by the term &#39;equal pay&#39;. We have heard it said that it means equal pay for the sexes. That is not so. It means equal remuneration for work of equal value, irrespective of the sex of the person who performs that work. We realise that many avenues of employment are peculiarly suitable for women, for which they receive appropriate remuneration. The proposal now before us does not envisage every woman in Australia suddenly receiving at least the male basic wage. That would be a ridiculous suggestion. There is a great need for the Government to face up to the responsibilities which it has to shoulder as a member of international bodies. Over the years we have been very proud of the part that Australia has played in the formation of some of these national bodies and of her being a member of them. </para>
          <para>When the United Nations came into being in 1945 the Australian delegation played a very important part in its establishment. We were honoured when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> was appointed  president  of the General Assembly of the United Nations. During the sessions of the organisation which were held in Paris in 1948 the original Universal </para>
          <para class="block">Declaration of Human Rights, which was of particular interest to women, was formulated. Since that time, on every occasion when the equality of women in regard to opportunities and remuneration has come up for confirmation before the appropriate bodies the Australian delegates have either voted against the proposal or have abstained from voting. Today we have the startling fact that forty-five nations in the world have adopted the principles of the United Nations charter and of the International Labour Organisation conventions but Australia has not done so. We regard some of these nations as backward countries, and to some we are giving economic aid. We regard ourselves as being a very advanced nation, as enjoying a very high standard of living and as being blessed very prolifically by nature; yet we just do not measure up to our responsibilities as a member of these international organisations. </para>
          <para>In order that the Senate may understand more fully what is actually meant by the proposal we are discussing. I refer to the fact that earlier this year the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations submitted to the General Assembly the text of a draft declaration relating to the elimination of discrimination against women. I would like to read extracts from this resolution, which was drafted only in May of this year. The preamble reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The General Assembly, </para>
            <para>Considering that the peoples of the United Nations have, in the Charter, reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women. </para>
            <para>Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts the principle of nondiscrimination and proclaims that all human beings arc born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, including any distinction as to sex. </para>
            <para>Taking into account the resolutions, declarations, conventions and recommendations of the United Nations and the specialised agencies designed to eliminate all forms of discrimination and to promote equal rights for men and women. </para>
            <para>Concerned that, despite the Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other instruments of the United Nations and the specialised agencies and despite the progress made in the matter of equality of rights, there continues to exist considerable discrimination against women, </para>
            <para>Considering that discrimination against women is incompatible with human dignity, and with the welfare of the family and of society, prevents their participation, on equal terms with men, in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their countries, and is an obstacle to the full development of the potentialities of women in the service of their countries and of humanity, </para>
            <para>Convinced that the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world, and the cause of peace require the maximum participation of women as well as men in all fields, </para>
            <para>Considering that it is necessary to ensure the universal recognition in law and in fact of the principle of equality of men and women, </para>

            <para>The current (22nd) session of the General Assembly has not yet given consideration to the draft declaration and any amendments to it </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That being so, I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> whether the Government has considered this matter and whether it has given any instructions to its delegates at the United Nations now that it is known that the matter is specifically to be raised during the present session of the General Assembly. </para>
          <para>It has always been the proud boast of supporters of this Government and of all in this Parliament that Australia has adhered to its international obligations. Even when the parties represented in the Parliament have differed over some of those obligations the government of the day  has  stood by its treaty obligations and in this has received the loyal support of the party or parties in opposition, lt is incumbent on the present Government to support the declarations that have been made by the United Nations through various instrumentalities and also by the International Labour Organisation if we are to hold up our heads as citizens of one of the nations that really honours its obligations. True, this declaration has not yet been ratified by the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America or New Zealand, in addition to Australia. But it has been ratified by forty-five other countries. The number might have increased since I was given that figure. The United Kingdom, for instance, does give equality to women employed in its government work force. So does the United States of America. I happened to be in the United States in 1964 when the United States Government, had just brought out its report on the status of women in that country. It had appointed a special committee to deal with the position of women generally, with the disabilities or otherwise that they suffered - legally, constitutionally, politically, economically and in any other way. </para>

At the Forty-second Session of the International Labour Organisation, Australia adopted the convention and recommendation concerning discrimination. However the Australian Government delegates abstained from voting in connection with the convention, but supported adoption of the recommendation after the convention had been approved. During the past 15 or 16 years we have seen the same shilly-shallying on the part of Government representatives at these conferences. They agree in principle but when it comes to a vote they walk out or vote against the proposal. Of course, I have seen the same thing happen in the Senate. The reason why I have brought the matter up is that t happen to be one of the few women in this community who, in the employment that they follow, enjoy the right of equal pay. I doubt whether any male honourable senator would take it very kindly if women senators were paid less than he was. </para>

              <para>- As a matter of fact, if work were paid at its valuation it might be quite a different story. I am not pointing the bone at anyone. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> had better be a bit careful because he does not know what might happen if he pursued that line. Before I entered the Senate I happened to be a teacher. In that profession women were discriminated against although we had done exactly the same course of training and had exactly the same qualifications as, and sometimes&#39; much higher qualifications than, our male colleagues had. When they were sick we were called upon to do their jobs. During the war I had to take control of a football team. All I could do was to take the members of the team down to the playing field, count them as they went on, let them go for their lives and count them as they came off, and if the number was the same everything was all right. That was part of having to do a man&#39;s job in many fields in which we were not trained or capable. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>But where women are capable of doing a job and where the result of their labour is equal in value, they should not be penalised and made to become a lower rate work force. Some mcn oppose this principle because they are afraid for their jobs. They say that they are saving up to get homes and to look after families when they come along and so forth, which is very good. But I think that in these days of equality of education each year more women are entering more fields which were hitherto primarily open only to men. Earlier in the century very few vocations were open to women. They could become seamstresses. Their industry has always been a cradle of sweated labour. Many years ago, after my father was injured in an accident - this was before the days of workers&#39; compensation - my mother was forced to do white sewing for a big firm in Perth. I never enter the premises of that firm. She had to make pillow slip and pillow cases and was paid 3d a dozen. If the articles had frills around them she was paid 5d a dozen. Out of that payment she would have to supply her own tapes and cottons. Those were the conditions from which women have been rescued. Women could become shop assistants. What happened during the depression? They were employed as shop assistants only during the busy hours of trading. They were hired to work between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. and were paid only hourly rates - a couple of shillings an hour. This method was used to avoid employing them for a full week. </para>
          <para>Female doctors are not found in such great numbers as their male counterparts. Female doctors are not given opportunities equal to those given to male doctors and few are found in the top ranks of their profession. Women doctors are employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. They have excellent academic records and they treat patients in exactly the same way as do male doctors. They are employed in repatriation hospitals, but because they are engaged in the Public Service they receive a lower rate of salary than do male repatriation doctors. </para>
          <para>When I was in Los Angeles I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Wilson,</inline> an Australian Trade Commissioner in the United States. She is doing a very fine job for Australia but she is employed at a lower rate of pay than are male trade commissioners. I cannot see how this is just. It is not just. We must educate the community to realise that equal payment for work of equal value is the just entitlement of women and that men as well as women should strive for its introduction. At times men are afraid to give women equal pay because they believe they might lose their jobs. This has been proved to be wrong. A firm in Perth which conducts a chain of stores - I will not name it because I do not wish to give it a free advertisement; it is well known to everybody in Western Australia - brought in equal pay for women a little over 12 months ago. A great deal of criticism came from some sources. Some people thought that the stores would not pay their way, but they have shown increased turnover and increased profits. This has resulted not only from the extra work that the women employees are willing to do because they are getting just pay, but also from the recognition of the community generally of what the stores have done in bringing in equal pay for women. I am hoping that other firms will follow the lead. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Government has said through its Ministers in the Senate when we have raised this matter before that it is a matter for the courts. Government supporters say: &#39;We cannot interfere with the courts&#39;, and so on. But the Government could take the lead in respect of its own employees. It has entered the field of wage fixation. A start could be made with the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, lt could bring about not only equal pay but also equal conditions of employment for women. It could lay down conditions which would have to be fulfilled, as it has done in the past. But the Government does not wish to provide equal pay and equal conditions for women. It takes the easy way out and uses the excuse: &#39;Leave it to the various tribunals&#39;. If the Government were to introduce equal pay for its female employees it could have a great effect throughout the whole community. </para>

              <para>- 1 am not very good at figures. The honourable senator is better at that than I am. In any case that is no longer a valid argument. But let me relate the experience of New South Wales. Over the years, that State has been introducing equal pay for some of its public servants such as teachers. People said that this was not practicable; that it would put New South Wales at a great disadvantage as compared with the other States. But when the 40-hour week was introduced, it was argued that the economy of New South Wales would ^suffer greatly in comparison with the economies of all the other States. We were told that New South Wales just could not afford the 40-hour week. But what happened? Not only did the economy of New South Wales not suffer but the example set by that State was followed by every other State, and by the Commonwealth itself. </para>

          <para>I understand that the Queensland Government has made a start towards equal pay for its employees, especially teachers, although I am not quite certain of the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morris</inline> should be able to put me right on that. Not only has the South Australian Government been granting equal pay to its teachers over the years but last week, or the week before, it brought down legislation for the inclusion of the equal pay provision in the awards of various branches of industry in that State. In Tasmania, the Lower House passed similar legislation, but it was defeated in the Upper House. Otherwise, the principle would have been in operation there also. I regret to say that, of all the States I think Western Australia is the only one that has not made some attempt to deal with the problem. </para>
          <para>This is not a problem which affects only the women of the community; it affects the community generally. Today, more girls are remaining at school to go on to universities. More are being educated in co-educational establishments. They are being educated in the sciences, the arts and so on. They have to sit for the same examinations and meet the same requirements as the males. Fresh vistas should be open to them because of this education. In my view, this is one of the most important questions of the day. Let me conclude my remarks by referring to a statement made by the late  President  Kennedy, who was a champion of this cause of equal opportunities and remuneration for women. When speaking on the establishment of the President&#39;s Commission on the Status of Women, he said: </para>

            <para>This is a task for the entire nation. lt is my hope that the Commission&#39;s report will indicate what remains to be done to demolish prejudices and outmoded customs which act as barriers to the full partnership of women in our democracy. The Commission will welcome recommendations from all groups on this crucial matter. Progress wilt require the co-operation of the whole community. </para>

          <para class="block">What he had to say about America is equally applicable to Australia today. ( hope that as a first step towards granting women equal pay for equal work in the Commonwealth Public Service the Government will set up a commission. I hope too that it will not be content with merely establishing a fact finding commission but that the commission&#39;s report will be followed by action similar to that taken in America after the late  President  Kennedy&#39;s Commission submitted its report. I might remind the Senate also of what another great feminist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Eleanor</inline> Roosevelt, said.  Her  reply to those who, although they agreed with the principle of equal pay for equal work, argued that the time was not yet: opportune and counselled waiting until tomorrow was: &#39;Tomorrow is now.&#39; </para>

            <para>-  The terms of the motion which is before us say that we should adjourn to a particular time because firstly, of the Government&#39;s failure to honour its international obligations in connection with, equal pay for work of equal value. There is absolutely no foundation whatever for any charge that the Commonwealth is dishonouring any international obligations into which it has entered with relation to this matter. </para>

          <para>I think we should be perfectly clear as to what has been done in this field. The International Labour Organisation had before it a motion which urged that the principle of equal pay for equal work should be adopted by the countries which were members of the Organisation. The Australian delegation voted more than once in favour of the adoption of the proposal that the principle of equal pay for equal work should be accepted. But the motion before the International Labour Organisation did not finish by saying: &#39;The principle of equal pay for equal work should be adopted&#39;; it went on to say: &#39;The implementation of that principle in each component country of the Organisation should be according to the wage fixing methods in operation in each country at the time&#39;. There was no suggestion that any government should accept and immediately implement a principle which had been accepted. The position was that the normal processes in operation in a country should be followed to see that equal pay for equal work was introduced in that country. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The usual way in which these things occur is by an application to a conciliation or arbitration commissioner. My mind goes back to 1949-50 because, to the best of my knowledge, that was the last occasion on which the trade union movement, which one would normally expect to bring cases before the arbitration court for decision, made an application to the court for equal pay for equal work. I know of no application since made. On that occasion - so long ago, I admit - the court threw out the application on the grounds that the male basic wage in Australia provided for a man, his wife and family, and that if there were a desire to alter that concept, which may or may not bc in operation now but was in operation then, there should be an approach to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. No such approaches were made. Perhaps some senator on the Opposition side will be able to tell us why no such approaches were made by the trade union movement as a whole or by any single part of it. There may have been an application by some part of it - 1 do not know of any such application - but certainly there was no application by the Australian Council of Trade Unions.  So  the normal processes of wage fixing in operation in this country were not availed of by those who might most be interested to seek to avail themselves of them. </para>

              <para>-  The honourable senator is saying something quite different from what 1 am saying. I am pointing out the steps that have been taken to show the Government&#39;s acceptance of the principle of equal pay for equal work, and what has been clone to put that acceptance clearly before the people. I cite another instance of this Government&#39;s avoidance of discrimination in female employment. The honourable senator&#39;s mind will at once go back to the recent occasion when wc removed the long-standing bar on the employment of married women in the Public Service. So two great steps forward have been taken in the situation of females employed by the Commonwealth. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> could claim that anything I have said so far is in any way really subject to dissention or rebuttal. </para>

          <para>We have all heard the statement: &#39;All right, certainly in this country there is an arbitration court and there are conciliation commissioners which are the normal tribunals to alter wages, and we admit there have not been any applications to those tribunals to try to vary the female basic wage, but why does not the Commonwealth Government, regardless of the normal wage fixing methods in Australia, take unilateral action through its own Public Service to provide an equal base rate?&#39; There arc organisations in the Commonwealth Public Service culminating in the High Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations. 1 know of no application that that body has yet made. </para>

I do not draw conclusions from this point at this moment, but I suggest that honourable senators might turn their minds to whether it is not true that action in respect of the Commonwealth Public Service would have far wider effects than the smaller action that has been taken by State governments such as the New South Wales Government in respect of limited parts of their public services. Would not such action have a very strong effect on all the State governments which have partly- </para>

That is exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> says she wants. But would it not have such a very great economic effect on this country - on its internal and external operations - that this matter should be the subject of proper consideration by the highest arbitration tribunal which considers the economic effects on Australia whenever it is hearing an application for increased wages? </para>

          <para>What is being asked for here is not just for the Commonwealth Government to take some small action concerning only a few people in its own employ. What is being asked for is that the Commonwealth Government should bypass the constituted methods of fixing wages in the light of their economic effect on the country. That is a factor that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would take into account, as I think all honourable senators will agree, when considering something which is really not a small matter but one of the greatest concern to the Australian economy generally and consequently to Australian employment prospects generally. I have said that I am not drawing conclusions on that point. I am not saying what the economic effects would be; how far we could afford to go; or what steps, if taken, would have an effect-. I am merely saying that, whatever way we look at this matter, the results for Australia&#39;s external trade and internal employment would be great, and that therefore this is a proper subject for examination by the Arbitration Commission, to which we refer such matters in all other areas and to which the trade unions refer such matters. We have very largely taken these matters out of politics and left the Arbitration Commission to make its economic judgments on the cases of the protagonists before it. That is something which needs to be very carefully borne in mind when it is suggested that some comparatively light-hearted action should be taken- </para>

              <para>- . . . when it is suggested that action should be taken without a full realisation of the immense responsibilities involved. I believe that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> when he was Minister for Labour and National Service, stated on behalf of the Government that if a case such as this were brought before the Arbitration Commission by the Australian Council of Trade Unions or some other responsible body the Commonwealth Government would not oppose it in principle. So what is there to prevent the proper utilisation of the wage fixing machinery by the people who are so interested - and properly interested - in this matter? In doing that they would be acting in accordance with the accords that were signed and supported at the International Labour Organisation conferences in Geneva. Those accords state that the implementation of the principle to which we agreed should be carried out in that way in Australia. I do not know what the wage fixing methods applicable in other countries are. But, whatever they are, they are the ones that should be used in the respective countries. </para>

              <para>- I think I have dealt with that point a little. What the honourable senator is really asking the Government to do is to bypass the arbitration machinery on a matter that has immense and far reaching economic consequences. Such action could be initiated by either the ACTU or a particular union to which some honourable senators opposite belong. I do not know the unions to which they belong, but I am sure that some of them belong to some unions. Why is not action initiated in that way? </para>

              <para>- That would be the result of action taken before the State conciliation commission. But what we are talking about has Australia-wide application. I speak subject to correction, but I believe that at long last an application for equal pay is now before an Australian wage fixing tribunal. I believe that the Bank Officials Association now has such an application before the Arbitration Commission. I suppose that the decision in that case will have considerable influence on decisions of the Commission in respect of related industries. </para>

              <para>- I am talking about an application that is before the Arbitration Commission at the moment. No doubt the decision on the bank officers&#39; application will have a very considerable effect. If it goes the way the union would like it to go, it should be an encouragement to other employee organisations to apply to have it extended. If it is true that such applications are being made and that some of them are now before the Arbitration Commission - the proper wage fixing machinery - does that not show that this is the proper way and the traditional way for a matter of this kind to be dealt with in Australia? </para>

              <para>- Is there not a tribunal to which public servants can apply? I believe that there is a Public Service conciliation and arbitration commission. My nomenclature may not be accurate, but undoubtedly there is a tribunal to which professional officers and other public servants can apply for wage variations. If they have not applied for equal pay for equal work, why have they not done so? If they have a case before the tribunal now, then let us leave it to the tribunal and do not let us suggest that we, as members of the Parliament, should take such a far reaching decision, unless honourable senators opposite wish to adopt an attitude which I would not adopt although I understand some of the arguments for it. I refer to the view that we should not have arbitration in Australia because we are taking away from the Parliament and giving to an arbitration tribunal the power to make decisions of great economic moment affecting wage levels and employment and economic matters generally. As I said, I would not adopt that attitude, but it is the only basis on which a proper case could be made out for abandoning the normal wage fixing methods. </para>

          <para>Let me sum up. There oan be no proper or true accusation of failure to honour international agreements because, whilst we have supported and still support the principle, we have not refused to do anything that we undertook to do. It can be claimed that the Government should take the administrative steps suggested in the second part of the matter of urgency towards providing equal pay for equal work. But I do not think that claim can be sustained in view of the arguments that I have put forward on the immense and far reaching economic effect - something that traditionally is dealt with by our wage fixing machinery, which is still available to deal with it and which has had some cases along these lines brought before it - and in view of the fact that a senior spokesman for the Government has said that an application along these lines would not be opposed in principle. In support of that statement, I point out that in fact the Government has voted for this in principle at conferences of the International Labour Organisation, and that in practice the Government has removed the discrimination of the marriage bar against women and is paying equal pay for equal work in respect of the margin for skill component of wages in the Commonwealth Public Service. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is discussing a matter of urgency raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney.</inline> This is an extremely important matter. The honourable senator has referred to the Government&#39;s failure to honour its international obligations and to take all possible legislative and administrative steps towards achieving equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. It is obvious from the speech of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> that the terms of the motion have touched the Government on the raw. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What is involved is a double accusation, firstly that the Government has failed to honour its international obligations in this respect and secondly that it has failed to do what it could have done legislatively and administratively to put into effect the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. The Minister has argued that the Government has not been guilty of a breach of international obligation because Australia has never ratified Convention No. 100 of the International Labour Organisation adopted in June 1951, although Australia did subsequently adopt in principle a recommendation approving the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. I concede that Australia has not ratified the Convention. We have in fact a very poor record in ratification of ILO conventions. We have allowed 16 years to pass without ratifying the Convention. We have not followed the example of about thirty other countries. We have not done what countries like Indonesia, India and Japan have done, namely write into our Constitution the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. We lag behind countries which we and the world generally would regard as less advanced in this respect than Australia. </para>

              <para>- It may be a bit of both but the fact is that having voted for the principle, as the Leader of the Government has told us Australia did, it seems to me that Australia undertook certain international obligations, You may say that they are not strictly binding in the international law sense, but as a matter of morality, having committed itself to the principle, and this principle being involved in a recommendation adopted by the ILO, after the ILO Convention was adopted Australia&#39;s obligation  -  1 am quoting the words of the Convention - is to promote and insofar as is consistent with such methods, ensure the application to all workers of the principle of equal pay for men and women workers for work of equal value. </para>

          <para>We have witnessed a magnificent example of wriggling by the Leader of the Government on this question. He referred ,to the Government&#39;s not opposing the principle, whereas in fact the international obligation is not merely not to oppose the principle but to support it and to support it throughout the range of national activity. That means supporting it wherever it is possible for the Government to take action. In short, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney&#39;s</inline> argument is that there is no limitation of the Commonwealth&#39;s power to prescribe salaries for its own officers in the Commonwealth Public Service. So the first thing the Government could do without any legal inhibition or restriction is to apply this principle in the Commonwealth- Public Service. It is of no use talking, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> did by way of interjection, about the millions of dollars which the application of this principle would cost. The former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, in answer to a question on 17th May 1962 from the present Leader of the Opposition in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> referred to the estimated cost of applying the principle in the Commonwealth Public Service and said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The estimated cost of introducing equal  remuneration  for men and women for work of equal value,  that  is, of introducing an equal base rule in the case of those females already receiving equal margins, is - </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">
              <item label="(a)">
                <para>approximately &#163;1.3m per annum for female employees of the Commonwealth Government employed under the Public Service Act; and </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(b)">
                <para>approximately &#163;650,000 per annum for all other civilian female employees of the Commonwealth Government except locally recruited  staff  employed overseas. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So the total cost, as estimated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies in 1962, was a little less than &#163;2m per annum. Since that time 5 years have elapsed and one may take it that the cost now would bc about $5m. </para>
          <para>This is really what we are asking the Commonwealth Government to face up to. We are met with the argument that the Commonwealth is not opposed. This attitude of non-opposition has been held by the Commonwealth for more than a decade. In 1958 the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt),</inline> who was then Minister for Labour and National Service, said that the Commonwealth did not oppose the principle of equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value, but where have we ever had from this Government or any responsible spokesman for it any indication that it is prepared to support the principle? There is all the difference in the world between non-opposition and support. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline>said that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> at some time - I do not recall this having been said - indicated that if an application were made to the industrial tribunals the Commonwealth would not oppose it. What does non-opposition mean in these tribunals? It simply means staying neutral, lt does not mean support. 1 invite any honourable senator on the Government side who rises to take part in the debate to say whether the Commonwealth will support such an application before the industrial tribunals. If the Government is not prepared to go that far it is not doing what it should do as a matter of obligation, legal and moral, because we arc committed to the principle. The Government is not doing what it should as a matter of obligation to promote the principle and to ensure that it is adopted. I do not think any honourable senator opposite can gainsay that proposition. This is more than an industrial matter. It is easy to look at this question as though it were simply an industrial question. </para>
          <para>Something much more is involved than a mere industrial question. In Victoria 55 years ago the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leo</inline> Cussen, a judge of the Supreme Court, hearing an appeal from a wages board dealing with an application for equal pay said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This is a matter of such profound political, social and economic importance that it is a matter tor the legislature. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Mark you, that was in 1912, but he might have been saying it today. In 1967 in Victoria the teachers&#39; tribunal, which has been asked in recent times to adjudicate on the subject of equal pay - Victoria and Western Australia are the two States in which the principle of equal pay for women teachers has nol been adopted - has said that this matter is much too important to be decided by an industrial tribunal; it is a matter of economic and social policy that has to be decided by the legislature. What is involved here is not simply an industrial question; it is a matter in which Australia is committed internationally to a social judgment about the place of women in society. That is what the argument is really all about. We cannot talk about equality of status for women where we have no equality of remuneration. </para>
          <para>To the extent to which the Commonwealth has recently removed barriers to married women working in the Commonwealth Public Service, that move is welcome. It should have happened ages ago. But the equality is incomplete because women are not guaranteed equal pay for work of equal value in the Commonwealth Public Service. One would not expect a woman member of Parliament, whether in this Parliament or in any other, to accept remuneration at less than the rate which is given for other members of Parliament because by so doing she would be accepting a second class status. This is the crux of the matter. It is the kernel of the question in the view we put. </para>

          <para>The Commonwealth has not done what it could have done. It should be setting the lead. It should be saying: &#39;We can grant this equality to our own officers. We do not have to have a hearing before the Arbitrator. We are perfectly able to make the big judgment that is required on a principle which is so important and we can apply it in areas where we have the say.&#39; It is only where there is a disagreement between employer and employee about conditions of employment that the arbitral process is invoked. If agreement can be reached between employer and employee - this has often happened - there is no need for an, arbitrator. As to the general case that might be brought in one industry or in industry generally, this is a matter on which the unions would make up their minds as to how they apply to the industrial tribunals. But so far there has been no indication from the Commonwealth that it will support the argument before the industrial tribunal. All the rest of it is mere talk. It is only talk to speak in the grandiose language, in the exquisite language which conceals meaning, that we get on these questions. It is so much talk to speak about non-opposition. The positive obligation is to take positive steps to promote the principle. We cannot see why it is not possible for the Commonwealth to do this. It can do it and in so doing it will be applying a principle which already has world wide acceptance and which is in the Declaration of Human Rights. It was adopted in express words in the Treaty of Rome constituting the European Economic Community. </para>
          <para>All over the world this principle is coming to be regarded as important because it is part of the emancipation of peoples and part of the emancipation of underprivileged groups within each separate country. In some countries it may be people of a subject race; in some countries it is people of a subject sex. We believe in this principle. We would deem it extremely important for a country like Australia which, in many respects, is entitled to claim that it is among the most advanced countries in the world, although it is not one of the largest. We believe that in our own country it is high time the principle was not only talked about but acted upon. </para>

              <para>- I wanted to offer a purely charitable reason for not understanding the honourable senator&#39;s interjection. Passing from that, it is said in this motion that the Senate should adjourn because of the Government&#39;s failure to honour its international obligations. The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> has dealt with this matter, but to put the record straight I quote the terms of convention No. 100 of the International Labour Organisation conventions which reads: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>Bach member shall by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration promote and, in so far as consistent with such methods, ensure the application to all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The terms of that ILO convention recognise that in the member countries there are particular methods by which industrial changes are achieved. The obligation of members who signed the convention is to promote this principle by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration. It is quite clear that in the Commonwealth sphere the predominant function of the Federal Parliament in industrial matters is confined to legislating for arbitration and conciliation. lt is mere distortion of an irresponsible kind to suggest that the Common wealth Parliament has a direct power to implement this principle by legislation. The ILO convention recognises the propriety of adhering to the appropriate means that the country has constituted to alter rates of remuneration in industry. </para>
          <para>The Opposition says that the Government has failed to take all possible legislative and administrative steps towards achieving equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. The main suggestion seems to be that the Commonwealth should introduce this principle blandly in the Public Service. I shall examine that suggestion. The Commonwealth has shown its recognition of the rights of women by taking a very forward step within the last 12 months to remove all the handicaps suffered by married women in relation to employment in our Public Service. We took great care to give to married women by legislative means full status and remuneration in the Public Service. We made provision for the vicissitudes of their sex. The base rate in the Public Service is fixed according to the position and margins are applicable to those positions whether they are held by men or women. 1 suggest that it is irresponsible - indeed it borders on the ridiculous - to suggest that the Federal Government and the Federal Parliament should apply to members of the Public Service a principle of such wide implication as that contained in the proposal that we are discussing. In the course of my speech I shall show that the number of Public Service personnel is altogether too great and that the growth should be arrested. </para>
          <para>In my opinion it would be quite inappropriate for the Federal Parliament to select the Public Service as the privileged section of workers in Australia to whom this principle should apply. The implications of this principle are so wide, not merely in the industrial field but also in the social field, that it would be quite wrong to apply it to the Public Service. It is said that members of the Australian Labor Party are propagandists for removing all discrimination between the sexes. We have had to consider the conjugal state of workers. Married, workers were found to be at a disadvantage when we introduced child endowment. As 1 have pointed out, the restriction on the employment of married women in tha Public Service was remedied last year.. </para>
          <para>So that we may understand the degree to which females are employed in the work force, I propose to refer to some figures which are applicable to June 1961. They are the latest that I have available. They show that females represented 25.1% of the total Australian work force and that males represented 74.9%. The females were classified into the following categories: </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="036232196710183_19_2.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">There are some other interesting details that I shall give. I refer to those industries in which the percentage of the female work force is above 20%. They are as follows: Manufacturing industries, 23.9%; commercial industries, 22.2%; and public authority and professional, 24.7%. I suggest to the Parliament that the powers that the Federal Parliament has conferred upon the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission show that it is recognised that the Commission has the chief and predominant responsibility for moulding the development of industrial conditions - so much so that in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act the following matter was specifically included in the definition of the term &#39;industrial matters&#39;: any claim that the same wage shall be paid to persons of either sex performing the same work or producing the same return of profit or value to their employer. </para>
          <para class="block">This Parliament recognised that one of the special matters within the jurisdiction and authority of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was the determination of whether or not this principle should apply. </para>
          <para>In the national wage case of 1967, the Commission, in deciding to substitute for the basic wage plus a margin the concept of a total wage, had this to say about the significance of that principle in relation to the female wage: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Although we refer to the total wage, there will for the present be a different total wage for males and females and a number of total wages for many classifications. These result from existing basic wage differentials and from the quite complex history of basic wages, particularly those for females, starting many years ago from a concept of differing needs and responsibilities of men and women. Both basic wages have over the years been adjusted in a variety of ways. We are conscious of these apparent anomalies, but consider it is not practicable to attempt to deal with either at this time. </para>
            <para>The community is faced with economic industrial and social challenges arising from the history of female wage fixation. Our adoption of the concept of a total wage has allowed us to take an important step forward in regard to female wages. We have on this occasion deliberately awarded the same increase to adult females and adult males. The recent Clothing Trades decision affirmed the concept of equal margins for adult males and females doing equal work. The extension of that concept to the total wage would involve economic and industrial sequels and calls for thorough investigation and debate in which a policy of gradual implementation could be considered. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The process is in the course of evolution. In my view it would be destructive in the extreme for this Parliament to intervene, especially when it is known to the Labor Party that the trade union movement has not resolved its attitude to this question. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> pointed out, a claim for the application of this principle has not been made in an important case or in an important dispute in the federal sphere. To apply this principle as suggested would be a complete intrusion by the Parliament into a matter which is predominantly industrial in nature and which the Arbitration Commission is already developing, as shown by what it stated in the judgment which I have read. In my view it would be mischievous for us to interfere. </para>

              <para>- Well, it is the same thing. Today we on this side of the Senate are putting to the Government a plea that it do the right thing in this matter. The High Council of Public Service Organisations and the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations have been saying ever since the Equal Remuneration Convention was adopted in 1951 that there ought to be some move towards its ratification and that this Government should do everything possible to promote it and should act administratively to assent to it. This is what the urgency motion now before the Senate proposes. This is not a political move by any means. As honourable senators will probably remember, this matter has been the subject of an annual campaign both by overall workers and white collar workers for more than 10 years. Over that time, they have been continually urging the Commonwealth Government to apply the principle of equal pay to its own employees. If the Government rests on the difficulty of getting employers within the States that are constituent members of the Australian Federation to agree - a difficulty that it has often mentioned - let it at least promote equal pay among its own employees. The cost would be very small, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> has pointed out. The Government could have adopted equal remuneration for its own employees years ago and in addition it could have promoted a meeting of the State Premiers to consider this matter. </para>

          <para>In recent years, State legislatures, including that of my own State, have adopted legislation providing for equal pay for equal work because they know that this question, in its proper context, cannot be resolved before the arbitration tribunals. Before those tribunals, Conservative governments and conservative employers, within the legal framework, put arguments designed to impede any move for the adoption of equal pay, just as they resist all proposals for increases in wage levels. Since the adoption of the Equal Remuneration Convention by the International Labour Organisation, equal pay for equal work has been adopted in many industries. Many women are now in exactly the same position as men when they do the same work. In the various professions, many more women have been able to assume very high positions that formerly were exclusive to men and have shown that they are able to do the work equally well. This is the current trend in Australia, and this trend is even stronger overseas. But this Government still rests on the old position that it adopted in 1962. </para>

              <para>- No, it is not. Australia is a member of the International Labour Organisation. This Government and the governments of other member countries send representatives to meetings of the Organisation and also promote the attendance of worker and employer delegates. The meetings of the Organisation decide on recommendations and conventions that are designed to raise social standards throughout the world and to prevent the great conflict between the poor nations and the rich ones. This Government, since it takes part in formulating such recommendations and conventions, and thereby in raising standards, ought to make sure that in Australia it takes proper steps to give effect to the recommendations and conventions of the Organisation. This is the test: What has it done to promote the principle of equal pay? I should like the Government ro answer that question. I have spoken on this matter in the Senate since 1962. The position that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> has taken up today is the same one that was adopted in 1962 by the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> who was then Minister for Labour and National Service. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> on that occasion used the same sort of argument as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has put today. He stated that the Government is not obliged to do any more than it is doing to implement the Convention. He said that once it has been adopted and we have ratified it, we must use the means appropriate within our own country to implement it. The appropriate means within the Australian community, industrially, do not depend only on court processes and conciliation and bargaining. We can show that in the whole gamut of industrial relations more and more female workers throughout the community are obtaining not just the margin awarded to male workers but the total wage paid to male workers. </para>

          <para>Each year, when we have raised this matter, the proposition that has been put to us in reply has been: &#39;Why does not the trade union movement go before the arbitration tribunals?&#39; The answer is short, and I have already given it to the Senate. We know the attitude of this Government and therefore it is of no use for us to go before the arbitration tribunals. Regularly, the Government has warned the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission against wage increases. When we have asked Ministers in this chamber to state whether, before the Commission, the Government would support the principle of equal pay, they have never answered: Yes. it will&#39;. Let the Leader of the Government tell us today that this Government will support this principle as some of the Stale governments are doing. If we received that response, it might be worth while for ACSPA, the High Council of Public Service Organisations, white collar workers in general and the trade union movement as a whole to take a different attitude, for it would be possible then to promote some process in the arbitration tribunals. </para>
          <para>I put it to the Senate this afternoon that the Government is merely shelving its responsibilities. It has taken no steps to promote the application of the principle of equal pay within the States. It has merely stood back and watched some State governments applying this principle to their own workers and dealing with all the difficulties of formulating the necessary legislation. This Government could do likewise if it wished to help. The only thing that it has ever done in response to the campaign by the trade union movement over the last 10 years has been to establish a Women&#39;s Section in the Department of Labour and National Service. It has refused even to accede to requests made by its own supporters. On a number of occasions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood has asked the Government to establish a women&#39;s bureau of the kind that operates in the United States of America, but the Government has refused. As recently as last year, it has reaffirmed that its attitude is that announced in 1962 by the former Minister for Labour and National Service. On that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">We on this side of the Senate cannot be truthfully accused of playing politics. We are bringing before the Parliament the urgent need for this Government to honour its obligation to do something to promote the adoption of the principle of equal pay for equal work. Later I shall return to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> in 1962, which is the basis of the Government&#39;s present approach to this question. </para>
          <para>As recently as November of last year, in answer to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson, Senator Gorton</inline> talked about the means appropriate to the promotion of equal pay. I have pointed out very clearly, I suggest, that the Government has an obligation to promote the adoption ot the principle of equal pay and similar measures. It may find difficulty with certain State governments in getting agreement, as it suggests, but it could at least bring the State Premiers together to discuss the matter. Why should the Government always rest on the subterfuge - and it is only a subterfuge - of saying: &#39;Why do the unions not go before the arbitration tribunals?&#39; We also hear from honourable senators on the Government side the sort of response that we heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> today. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> adopted much the same approach when he talked about reducing the male rate. In 1962, speaking of the instruments of the ILO, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is to be noted of the instruments, first, that they are silent about the level at which equality is to be established: They would be satisfied by a reduction of the male rate to the female or by bringing the two together at some intermediate point; they would be equally satisfied by raising the female rate to the male. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What sort of backward nonsense is this, in a world in which this Government is urging more females to go into industry? We find Ministers on important occasions urging women to enter the work force and giving figures lo show the increase of the employment of females in industry. But they refuse to give women wage justice. We now have a situation in which women are working beside men, doing exactly the same work and receiving less pay. This is wrong. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has talked about figures. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> has been before meetings of employers and advocated that they should adjust their rosters and do everything else that they could do to increase the number of women employed in industry. The percentage of women entering industry is becoming greater. The intake is accelerating. Although in the current year the number of civilian employees received into the work force has in fact dropped and is the lowest intake since 1962, the increase in the intake of female workers is marked. I should like to refer to a document entitled Women in the Work Force&#39;, issued by the Department of Labour and National Service in July 1967. The Department gives figures to show the effect of the Government&#39;s efforts to persuade employers to make adjustments in order to bring more females into industry. At page 30 fi the document the Department states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Females constituted nearly 40% of the increase in the civilian work force between 1954 and 1966. In the same period the female work force increased at a higher average annual rate than the male in both private and government sectors. The higher rate of female increase is particularly noticeable since 1961. </para>
            <para class="block">A table on page 7 of the document shows that between 1947 and 1961 the total population increased by 38.6% and the work force increased by 32.2%. The increase in the female population was 37.4% but the increase in the female work force was 47.7%. Here we see evidence of the situation that I have mentioned previously. Various Ministers have gone to meetings of employers and meetings of women and urged that there be more attraction within industry for women workers. We know that every conference of the International Labour Organisation is for the purpose of raising standards of workers. The Government is represented and it takes along representatives of employers and employees, who take part in the deliberations. If the Government faces difficulty in implementing ILO recommendations because of CommonwealthState relations, it can easily bring about consultations with State Premiers to see whether this will assist. I ask the Government to point out where it has taken such action in all these years. Nothing has been done to give effect to this principle. Our action in bringing forward this matter is on behalf of all people in industry. Recently the Australian Council of Trade Unions passed a resolution in this connection. This proposition has been put to the Government regularly by deputations and by other means for many years: </para>
          </quote>
          <quote>
            <para>We call on the Commonwealth Government to apply the principle of equal pay to women employees in all Commonwealth Government instrumentalities and services and stress that further representations be made to the Commonwealth Government for the establishment of an Australian Commission on the Status of Women similar to that of the USA and for the setting up of a Women&#39;s Bureau within the Department of Labour and National Service. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I conclude by pointing out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood herself asked the Government to do this in recent years but the Government refused, saying that the United States Commission on the Status of Women was too wide and there was <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> need for such an organisation in Australia. All that we have is a fairly limited section of the Department of Labour and National Service which deals only with basic employment questions and  not  with wider issues, although the Government is encouraging a greater intake of females into the work force at lower rates of pay. The Government is accepting a lower standard for females generally in industry when it can take a part in promoting equal pay for women who do the same work as men. </para>

            <para>- J find myself in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> when he claims that these matters of urgency, of which this is the third in about 5 or 6 sitting days, indicate that the Opposition is more concerned with establishing means by which it can assert clements of political propaganda, because a Senate election is around the corner. That is fair comment; I do not think any objection can be taken to it. There is a vast backlog of parliamentary business which it is necessary to get through prior to the lifting of the Senate for the election. I do not quite see how it will be got through. The services of the community have to be sustained by the passing of the Estimates and the Appropriation Bills. Yet in the last 5 or 6 sitting days we have had these matters brought into the Senate on the ground that they are matters of extreme urgency. 1 will not argue that perhaps some are not matters of urgency that require attention but there have been some 6 or 7 weeks in which these matters could have been brought to the attention of the Senate. They are not any more urgent today than they were 6 weeks ago. I think it is quite clear, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> claims, that this is an electioneering device. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, having said that, I would like to pay a compliment to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> for speaking out, as she has done so often, on behalf of her sex in relation to equality of pay for work of equal value. 1 am sorry that as we get older we do not succeed in attaining that which we set out to do. I refute <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop&#39;s</inline> claim that it is a stupid argument to say that equal pay between the sexes must be on the basis which 1 shall make clear. I say without any cynicism at all that if payment were on the basis of results and competence <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> would be entitled to higher pay than some other members of the Parliament. She introduced into this debate a draft resolution which is at the present moment being trundled through the General Assembly of the United Nations. By interjection I asked her to read out the names of the nations that were sponsoring the draft resolution. The interesting thing is that we find that if is sponsored by the usual collection of ragbag nations inside which there is no device, as far as I have been able to discover, by which the principles of the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation have been in any way put into effect. I have been to Indonesia, Algeria, Gabon and some other African nations, and I have never seen in those nations any attempt to apply equal pay for work of equal value. In fact, the delegates of those nations are attempting to create inside the United Nations means by which they can put pressure on their own domestic political parties or governments. The fact is that the nations that have abstained from acceding to this draft treaty or having very much to do with it are nations that have in their own domestic jurisdictions the means of solving the problem as to whether or not the conventions of the International Labour Oragnisation should be put into effect. </para>

              <para>- The United States is a third. One cannot use what is happening inside the United Nations, for example, as an argument to sustain the raising in the Senate this afternoon as a matter of urgency the proposal that legislation should be introduced and administrative action taken to establish equal pay for work of equal value, which is the formula of the International Labour Organisation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> also said that we have in this country a system by which wage problems can be solved. The issue that is quite clearly demonstrated in the Senate this afternoon is the means by which equal pay for work of equal value should be established in Australia. Because we have an arbitration system Government supporters do not accept the proposition contained in the matter of urgency raised by the Opposition. </para>

          <para>I do not think 1 am going outside . the bounds of forecasting when I say that not one honourable senator on this side of the chamber does not accept the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. I do not think I am committing any honourable senator on this side when I say that in private discussions as members of Parliament in the corridors and in the party rooms - it is certainly true so far as I am concerned - there is no opposition to the concept of equal pay for work of equal value. We on this side of the chamber are not reactionaries. I am arguing that I do not believe that the Commonwealth Parliament should bc turned into an economic commission to decide this matter. That would be highly dangerous. I do not believe that the Parliament is capable of assessing all the problems involved in this proposition. Indeed, governments of various hues in the past have decided that the method to solve these problems is to create an industrial and arbitral structure which should be charged with the responsibility of determining wage matters. </para>

              <para>- That is the key to the whole problem. The dilemma of honourable senators opposite at present is that they rely upon the industrial strength of the unions as part of the organisational capacity of the Australian Labor Party. From the unions they draw a great deal of their party funds and their organisational support for election campaigns. They are aware of this situation. They are also aware that the areas from which they draw their financial, industrial and organisational strength for election campaigns do not contain the people who will support the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. Honourable senators opposite, knowing that their own supporters do not or will not accept this principle, now seek to use the device of legislative practice inside the Parliament to achieve what they cannot get from their own supporters. I think this was clearly demonstrated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> advocate for the Australian Council of Trade Unions before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the national wage case which has only recently concluded. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> based his arguments in that case on the maintenance of the basic wage, and the basic wage is based upon the concept of needs according to an old formula that has been used in arbitration tribunals. The basic wage has not been based in the past on the concept of equal pay for work of equal value. In this urgent situation the distinguished and learned advocate of the trade unions, briefed by them to appear before the Arbitration Commission, did not at any stage so far as I have been able to discover raise the thesis of the International Labour Office that there should be equal pay for work of equal value. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Why is it not possible for any union to apply to the Arbitration Commission to have this principle embedded in the wage structure of the country? The Arbitration Commission in its judgment which changed the basic wage concept to a total wage concept, as mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> acknowledged that there is a growing understanding and climate of acceptance in Australia for equal pay for work of equal value. The Commission acknowledged the principle in part in the national wage case by giving the same increase of $1 a head in the total wage decision to both male and female workers. </para>
          <para>I look forward to the day when equality will be achieved, because I believe that one of the results to flow from it will be increased efficiency in Australian industry. That result will come because, I hope, a great number of women will enter the work force who are infinitely more competent to do some of the available work than are some of the males who are performing that work at present. I had an interesting experience recently in Sydney as  Chairman  of a Senate select committee. I was standing with my colleagues, one of whom was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson,</inline> on a Scandia ship. We were watching a man with a black box hanging from his shoulder organising the cranes of the ship to unload pre-slung cargo from the bottom of a hold. The thought crossed my mind that that position presented an ideal opportunity for the employment of a woman at high rates of pay. I am quite sure that the job would have been done much more efficiently by a woman than it was done by the man I observed. That is the key to the problem. Not one honourable senator opposite who has a trade union background will go to bis union and advocate, not equal pay for work of equal value, but that there should be opportunities inside the union for women. </para>

              <para>- The situation at Broken Hill is as good an illustration as any. I say that we would be totally recreant if we were to throw overboard the juridical system we have evolved by trial and error over the last 50 or 60 years and were to embark into an economic area by making ad hoc decisions in this Parliament as to what should be done. That juridical system is working very well. The only matter at issue between the Opposition and the Government is the method by which equal pay for work of equal value is to bc effected. The responsibility bears upon honourable senators opposite and members of the Opposition in another place to see that the organisations from which they spring accept their share of the responsibility to achieve in Australia the highly desirable objective of equal pay for work of equal value. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> has drawn to the attention of the Senate and therefore to the attention of the Australian people the Government&#39;s failure to honour its international obligation to take all possible legislative and administrative steps towards achieving equal pay for mcn and women for work of equal value. Despite all the reasons that have been enunciated this afternoon by Government spokesmen, the simple fact of the matter is that the Government has done nothing to honour its international obligation to effect equal pay for work of equal value. It has taken no legislative or administrative steps towards achieving that end. Therefore it is to be condemned by the Australian people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Women members of the Commonwealth Public Service, who are employed by the Government through its own instrumentality - the Commonwealth Public Service Board - are being discriminated against because of the failure to implement the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. They are regarded as second rate citizens by comparison with their male counterparts in the Commonwealth Public Service. This afternoon Government supporters have done a lot of tongue-in-cheek talking on this matter. The Government has had 16 years in which to act positively to honour its international undertaking or obligation, but it constantly refuses to do anything in that direction. It continues to adopt the attitude, as illustrated by its spokesmen this afternoon, that wage determinations are matters for the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It takes that attitude not because it lacks legislative <inline font-style="italic">power</inline> but simply because of its policy. The Government&#39;s case today, as it has been since 1951 when the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 100 and Recommendation No. 90 were signed, is that it is up to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and  up  to the trade union movement to make appli cation to the arbitration authorities for recognition of this principle. It has been said over and over again by Government spokesmen that they would not oppose such an application if it were made. I think this was repeated today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> quite rightly asked: Would the Government be prepared to support such an application? Why, as recently as early this year, when addressing a luncheon of the Chamber of Manufactures in Melbourne on the subject of (he failure of the Australian Government to support a request for an increase in the basic wage the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> said that the Government wanted to see comparative wage stability this year. But let me come back to the international recommendations. </para>
          <para>What was the International Labour Organisation recommendation to which this Government was a party? It was ILO Recommendation No. 90 of 1951 which said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Appropriate action should be taken after consulting with the workers&#39; organisations concerned, or, where such organisations did not exist, with the workers concerned </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">
              <item label="(a)">
                <para>To ensure the application of the principles of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value to all employees of central government departments or agencies; and </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(b)">
                <para>to encourage the application of the principle to employees of Slate, provincial or local government departments or agencies where these have jurisdiction over rates of remuneration. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That principle, which was agreed to by the Menzies. Government in 1951, was clear and simple. It did not say anything about asking the trade union movements of the various countries to request industrial tribunals to agree to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. It merely said that appropriate action should be taken, after consulting with the workers&#39; organisations concerned. </para>
          <para>Now we find that, after having ratified the agreement, every time the Government places an advertisement in the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39;, or any other large metropolitan daily, calling for the filling of vacancies, two rates of pay are advertised, one for females and another for males. In the last Commonwealth of Australia Gazette* of 5th October 1967 at page 5646, the situation with relation to salaries and general conditions is set out in this way: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The annual rates of salary are increased as follows, unless otherwise indicated in Public Service Board Circular No. 1967/24: </para>
            <para class="block">Adult Males . . Increase of $157 per annum </para>
            <para class="block">Adult Females . . Increase of $131 per annum </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There we see a difference of some$26 per annum in the rates of increase granted to males as compared with females. The same Gazette&#39; also contains this statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Except for positions exclusively for females, i.e. positions with female designations and those positions which include &#39;(Female)&#39; in the title, the nominal salary range is reduced by $402 when occupied by a female aged 21 years or over or by a junior female where no junior rates are prescribed for the position. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So the Commonwealth Government does discriminate to the extent of about $8 a week between the rates paid to male workers and those paid to female workers for performing work which is of the same value. I suggest that in this modern day and age, in this year 1967, bearing in mind that the Government was a party to an International Convention in 1951, it is a scandal that this situation is tolerated. </para>
          <para>Incidentally, speaking of the employment of women in the Commonwealth Public Service, it is very interesting to note a reply that was given to a question asked by me on 27th September 1966. The question was: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="1.">
              <para>How many officers of the Commonwealth Public Service are employed in the First and Second Divisions of the Service? </para>
            </item>
            <item label="2.">
              <para>How many of such officers are females? </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The then Leader of the Government in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty,</inline> informed me that the Public Service Board had stated that as at 30th June 1966 officers in the First Division of the Commonwealth Public Service numbered twenty-six and that the number in the Second Division was 589. He added that of this latter number a mere two were female officers. While this discrimination exists in 1967, while we have this difference of $8 a week between the rates of pay for male and female workers is it any wonder, that women in the Public Service cannot climb to the higher eschelons? </para>
          <para>But I suppose there is something from which direct employees of this Government can take hope. They have been struggling for proper recognition of their just rights for some 17 long years since the International Labour Organisation&#39;s recommendation was agreed to by this Government. But it took women in the United States of America 18 years to achieve success. The first Federal Equal Pay Bill for women was introduced in the Congress in 1945. After 18 years of effort by members of Congress, successive Administrations, labour unions, women&#39;s groups and others who were interested in the reform, the Federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 finally was enacted. In the &#39;AFL-CIO News&#39;, the American Federation of Labour Journal, of 25th May 1963, under the heading: &#39;Equal Pay Bill Passes Congress&#39; this statement appeared: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Labor backed Equal Pay for Women Bill moved through both the House and the Senate in less than a week - after an 18-year campaign for a Federal law to outlaw wage discrimination because of sex. </para>

In addition to ILO Convention No. 100, to which this country was a party, there was ILO Convention No.111 which banned discrimination not only on account of sex but also on account of race or creed. The Australian Government has done nothing about ILO Recommendation No. 90 or ILO Convention No. 100 although admittedly it was not prepared to be a signatory to the Convention. Britain, the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand have granted to their Public Service employees equal pay for work of equal value, but Australia has consistently refused to do anything about this matter for some 17 years despite the fact that it was a signatory to the ILO recommendation of 1951. ls it any wonder that in 1965 - a mere 2 years ago - <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Clair</inline> Isbister, an eminent female medical practitioner, said at the annual speech day of Fort Street Girls High School that Australia is a backward country as far as women are concerned? </para>

              <para>- It may be. This is a very interesting question and I hope that the Opposition speakers who are to follow mc in this debate will testify, or attempt to testify, on it. The closing days of a sessional period are not an opportune occasion for the introduction of an urgency motion such as the one now before the Senate. I do not think it can be substantiated. It relates to the Government&#39;s failure to take all possible legislative and administrative steps towards achieving equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. </para>

          <para>The first question to which one should apply his attention is: What are these alleged international obligations? Recommendation No. 90 which was before the 34th session of the International Labour Organisation in 1951 related to equal remuneration for mcn and women workers for work of equal value. This was adopted. The Convention requires member states of ILO - Australia was one of them - to promote and, so far as this is consistent with their existing methods of determining rates of remuneration, to ensure the application to all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. The important words in that Convention are: &#39;So far as this is consistent with their existing methods of determining rates of remuneration&#39;. On that aspect let me refer to some remarks which were made by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> in 1953 when he was Minister for Labour and National Service. He said: </para>
          <quote>

            <para>In the view of the Commonwealth, however, it would be undesirable and unsound to propose legislation to the Commonwealth Parliament for the adoption of this principle-- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Now come the important words -  in advance of a determination to like effect by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, which is the supreme arbitral tribunal in Australia. This attitude conforms with that adopted by successive Commonwealth Governments irrespective of Party. </para>
          <para class="block">That was the principle in 1953 and it is the principle today. Admittedly there is now no such court as the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration but we have a body which works under another name. The principle is that neither the Parliament nor the Executive should beat the gun in this matter when there is a proper arbitral body to determine it. </para>
          <para>On 5th June this year the decision in the national wage case was promulgated. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission made some very sound statements on this question of equal pay for males and females. It said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The community is faced with economic, industrial and social challenges arising from the history of female wage fixation. Our adoption of the concept of a total wage has allowed us to take an important step forward in regard to female wages. We have on this occasion deliberately awarded the same increase to adult females and adult males. The recent Clothing Trades decision affirmed the concept of equal margins for adult males and females doing equal work. The extension of that concept to the total wage would involve economic and industrial sequels and call for thorough investigation and debate in which a policy of gradual implementation could be considered. </para>

          <para>I think that not since 1949 have the unions advocated in the court this question of equal pay. Now an invitation has been extended to them, to the employers and to the Commonwealth to give careful study to these questions with the knowledge that the Commission is available to assist by conciliation or arbitration in the resolution of the problems. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holt</inline> said in 1953, the Commonwealth is not opposed to the principle of equal pay but it is opposed to beating the gun by beating recognised tribunals to a decision. Surely to goodness, it is appropriate to follow the wise advice given by the Commission in its decision in the national wage case on 5th lune last. 1 was very interested to read the following comment which appears on page 23 of the annual report of the Public Service Board for 1966-67: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On 28th June 1967 the High Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations requested a meeting with the Board in order to discuss this aspect of the Commission&#39;s decision. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Seeing the wisdom of the words of the Commission, the High Council made that request. I believe that that is the way in which this matter of equal pay for men and women should be resolved. The invitation extended by the Commission in its judgment on 5th June 1967 should be accepted. Following the lines of the request made by the High Council and using the auspices and good offices of the Commission, the parties should sit down and study this matter. After all, tremendous economic, industrial and social challenges arise from it. Therefore, I do not think it should be treated in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> and other members of the Opposition suggest; namely, by legislation of this Parliament or administrative action by any Minister of this Government. </para>
          <para>This matter should be discussed with the Commission. It should be argued. The good offices of the Commission should be used with a view to determining it. As I read the Commission&#39;s words, it calls for a gradual implementation, not a sudden implementation by legislative or administrative action, as is suggested in the remarks of honourable senators opposite. I consider that it is a matter for gradual movement after investigation and debate. The unions, the employers and the Commonwealth should be the three parties in the discussion. I do not think I can usefully add anything. I believe that the motion should not be carried. The debate has been useful, but on the other hand it has taken up considerable time, which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> pointed out, could have been used to greater advantage in consideration of the Estimates. </para>

Therefore our time could not be better used than by debating the need for this great social and economic reform. Although it may be becoming a hardy annual and although the accusation may be made that this matter of urgency has some political propaganda content, a political propaganda campaign can succeed only if it has wide support.

          <para>The indications are that all sections of society believe that there should be some recognition of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. On other occasions members of the Government parties have cast doubt on the possibility and desirability of the implementation of the principle. They have raised such arguments as the necessity for men and women to accept equal responsibilities. However to-day, in the main, they have said that they believe in the principle, but they have found some reason why the Government should not act as the matter of urgency says it should act. Let us see what validity there is in the claim of members of the Government parties. Let us see what is wrong with this matter of urgency. </para>
          <para>Because of the Government&#39;s failure to do anything in this field, this matter has been brought forward today. It is significant that it has been brought forward as part of Equal Pay Week which is organised throughout Australia. Firstly it refers to the Government&#39;s failure to honour its international obligations. We are told that the Government is not failing to honour such obligations. The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> referred to the 1951 International Labour Organisation conference decision that the principle of equal pay for work of equal value should be adopted by the member countries and said that Australia had already announced that it would not oppose an application for equal pay. But will the Government go before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or any other tribunal and say that in accordance with the ILO decision it supports the principle of equal pay? The Government is required to do that under the ILO decision, but we have no indication that it is prepared to do it. All that we are told is that it will not oppose an application at this stage. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> pointed out, the terms of the ILO decision were that the principle should be implemented in accordance with the policy of wage fixation in the country concerned. I do not know where members of the Government parties obtained their knowledge of wage fixation methods in Australia, but they have no idea of the method of operation of the tribunal that their Government&#39;s legislation brought into being. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not set up an arbitration body to decide all wage questions. The emphasis in the Act and the intention when it was introduced was that there be conciliation. The instructions given to the various commissioners and the powers contained in the Act in relation to conferences are designed to get the parties to agree if possible. The wage fixing tribunal has to decide questions only if the parties cannot agree. So the first essential under the Act that honourable senators opposite say we should accept is conciliation and agreement between the parties. In this debate we are asking that the Commonwealth Government, as the biggest employer of female labour in Australia, accept conciliation in accordance with the terms of its Act, try to reach agreement on this principle on which we all agree today, and implement it by a joint application or a consent application to the relevant arbitration tribunal for the fixation of equal wages. </para>
          <para>Let us look at what has happened to the wage structure in Australia. The previous argument about equal responsibility no longer has any validity. Previously we had a two-component wage. One component was the basic wage which was based on the needs of the family unit. It could be said that the female was not the basis of the family unit; that the husband had the responsibility of providing for his family and therefore should receive the basic wage. It is claimed that wages are now in excess of the needs of the family unit and are based upon the ability of the economy to pay. Whatever is the ability of the economy to pay, it must have the same ability to pay a female as it has to pay a male. Therefore the argument based on needs - that the needs of a female and a male are not the same - has been completely destroyed. The basis on which living wages are fixed in Australia today - the ability of the economy to pay - must apply to both sexes. The last basic wage decision went a step closer towards equality of wage rates because it provided a flat increase of $1 and declared a total wage. In future the total wage will be based on the ability of the economy to pay the work force, not the different sexes in the work force. This is a start towards equalisation of wages for the sexes. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> pointed out, the unions are invited to apply for gradual increases in the total wage. The unions are invited to discuss wage increases with employers on the basis of the capacity of industry to pay. </para>
          <para>The South Australian Government, rather than await a decision of the arbitration tribunal, reached agreement with teachers to introduce equal pay for the sexes over a period of 5 years. There is no reason why the Commonwealth should not adopt this policy with its employees. By acting in this way the Commonwealth would be following the principle laid down in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of discussing matters with employees. In granting equal pay for work of equal value the Commonwealth would be setting an example . to other employers. We favour the implementation of the principle of equal pay over a period of years. The Commonwealth should acknowledge its position as the biggest employer of female labour in Australia. lt should give a lead to other employers. lt should seek to give effect to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as was intended when the legislation was framed. It should promote the idea of reaching agreement with employees and resorting to arbitration only when all else has failed, lt should give some indication that it will adopt the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. lt is not true that the unions have not been concerned about this matter. We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> in snide fashion ask whether trade unions pay male rates to female employees. I believe that they do. There would be few unions in South Australia which do not pay male rates to female employees. 1 point out that trade unions are not employers within the definition in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Trade unions arc not bound by arbitration awards. Under the South Australian industrial code trade unions are not employers. So they are not bound by awards. But in South Australia the unions have reached agreement with the Federated Clerks Union to pay to their clerical employees the margin awarded to oil company clerks. This is the highest margin for clerks in South Australia. So not only do women employed by trade unions in South Australia get male rates of pay; they also get the highest, award rates for their classification. </para>
          <para>In the forefront of organisations in South Australia paying equal rates for work of equal value is the South Australian Public Service. It is paying equal rates by consent. This is what we urge the Commonwealth to do. Arrangements have been made for teachers in South Australia to have equal pay in 5 years. In South Australia barmaids receive equal pay. This is the result of legislative action. There is at the present time before the South Australian Parliament a proposal to alter the industrial code so as to require the industrial tribunal in that State to consider the gradual introduction of equal pay into all industries in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> doubted whether trade unions would be willing to accept females in industry if the principle of equal pay were adopted. In some cases some unions may be hesitant to see females employed in their industries because female labour is at present a threat to the wage standards of male employees. Trade unions have a responsibility to protect wage standards at all times. </para>

              <para>- A number of things have been said in the course of the debate which in my opinion indicate that it is anything but hopeless to expect the Government to deal with this matter sympathetically. I appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney&#39;s</inline> sincerity in raising this matter. On several occasions over the years I have heard her discuss this subject at length. I would say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> that I would be one who would support the general principle as being one which in due course will be applied throughout Australia. I believe that the honourable senator was being entirely unfair and entirely untruthful in asserting that the Government has failed to honour its international obligations. </para>

              <para>- I withdraw the word &#39;untruthful&#39;. I believe that the honourable senator&#39;s comment was designed to mislead people. Not one honourable senator on the Opposition side of the chamber has been willing to justify her words. She said that the Government has failed to honour its international obligations, but it has no international obligation in this matter. In that regard I do not believe that the words she used are fair. I give the honourable senator credit for bringing forward the point that equal work should be rewarded by equal pay. She has stated reasons for raising the argument at this time. It is because equal pay week is upon us. As we have in this community either a day or a week for nearly everything - a hospital week, apprenticeship week and equal pay week - I sincerely hope that our hours of sitting will not be taken up with a debate on the subject of whatever week it happens to be. I know that that would not be the wish of the honourable senator. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator has had the idea of dealing with this subject at this time when I believe we should be dealing with the Estimates. The suggestion of equal pay for equal work indicates that in the past there has been discrimination in relation to the volume of work performed by men and women. I have no doubt that eventually equal work will be rewarded on an equal basis whether the person performing the work is male or female. </para>

          <para>There has been some difference in the treatment of men and women and I imagine that in this growing community there has been a social need for this. If we look back for about 30 years we see that the concepts of need and social responsibility have carried with them the idea that the male basic wage should be related to the normal needs of an average employee with a wife and children. This principle has been to the fore in the Arbitration Court&#39;s approach to the basic wage. Through a succession of major cases before the Arbitration Court and, later, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the concept of the capacity of industry to pay a basic wage has become the dominant principle in assessing a basic wage. Although capacity to pay has become the dominant concept, this does not necessarily mean that there is now no element of the needs concept in the basic wage. As capacity to pay has become the dominant consideration and would apply in the event of an application by unions for a basic wage for females equal to that for males, it would be necessary to consider the effect of a higher female basic wage on the capacity of the economy to meet the added cost. I believe that there would be considerable disturbance to our economy if this concept were adopted too readily. </para>
          <para>If we consider the effect upon certain industries today of a female basic wage equal to the male basic wage honourable senators on both sides of the chamber must agree that industries such as the textile industry as they operate in Australia would be put out of business immediately if this concept were brought in at this time. A consideration of our taxation structure would be needed should this concept be adopted. Great consideration would have to be given to the social service benefits which are now payable and, should this principle apply, we would have to consider the effect on the employment of women generally. Surely that is a matter which should be discussed at length by those who propose that we should adopt this principle immediately. In our present situation, rather than increase the female basic wage to the existing level of the male basic wage, it may become necessary in some instances to reduce the male wage so that it is within the capacity of our economy to pay. I believe that equal basic wages at this time would bring about a reduction in the employment of females. 1 believe that this is one consideration to which the trade unions have given serious thought in not pursuing this matter before the industrial courts. </para>
          <para>Several honourable senators opposite have dealt with a matter which is basic to this proposal. I refer to convention No. 100 and recommendation 90 of the International Labour Organisation conference. If honourable senators opposite looked honestly at the convention they would agree that Australia has not in any way failed to meet its obligations. The wording read out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> said that this equal pay proposition should be brought about in a manner which is consistent with existing methods of determining rates of remuneration. That is what the Commonwealth is now doing and that is what the States also are doing. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator said that, only some States are doing this. It has already been stated that New South Wales has legislated for equal pay, but I have heard no member of the Opposition telling the Senate what has taken place in New South Wales. The passing of legislation in New South Wales does not mean that women doing equal work are getting the same rates of pay as men. The legislation applies to not more than 10% of female employees in that State. Further, that legislation does not comply with the instruments of the International Labour Organisation on equal pay. For example, it does not apply to women engaged on work which is usually performed by females. </para>

              <para>- Yes. One of the few exceptions in New South Wales are psychiatric nurses where male and female nurses are paid at the same rate. Is it suggested by any honourable senator opposite that the ILO intended that nurses generally would not be paid at the same rate? It must be agreed that that is proof that the concept recommended by the ILO has not been adopted in New South Wales. Honour-&#39; able senators opposite should consider that point. Although they have suggested that the State Governments of New South Wales and South Australia have been taking action along these lines, they must agree that the situation in those States at the moment is not what is now proposed. </para>

I suggest that even if the Australian Labor Party were in office today, it would not wish to ratify an agreement unless it could implement it. </para>

              <para>- The Government will not ratify an agreement unless it can implement it. We could have a situation similar to that which exists in a number of the countries to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> referred. They have ratified an agreement but they will never implement it. It is hypocrisy to do that. The Federal Government, of which I am very pleased to be a supporter, will not become a party to that type of situation. The Federal Government believes that the application of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value should be determined by the courts and the other established industrial tribunals. I do not know how we could argue otherwise. </para>

            <para>- 1 rise to support the proposal that has been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney.</inline> I like others want to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> on the wonderful work she has done in this chamber in relation to women in general and in particular to the subject we are now discussing. 1 am absolutely confident that she will be sitting in this House when a Labor government not only ratifies but implements the International Labour Organisation decisions regarding equal pay for work of equal value. A number of honourable senators from the Government side have said that they believe in the principle of equal pay. 1 suggest that this is the danger which confronts Australian women. People who believe in equal pay for equal work are not prepared to act to implement it. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster&#39;s</inline>statements were similar to the forebodings of people of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. If one were to read reports of the House of Commons debates in the 1840s, when children were still working in British mines, and were to read the forebodings of the Conservatives of that day, one would note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has uttered similar forebodings in this House this afternoon. Honourable senators opposite have said, in effect, that the time is not opportune to implement this principle of equal pay for equal work. How often have we heard it said that the time is not opportune? In 1842, when girls and boys of 8 and 10 years of age were harnessed to little carts in mines to pull the product out of the mine instead of its being done by horse or other methods, the Conservatives in the House of Commons said that the time was not opportune to alter the situation even though they regretted that they had to use children to do this work. </para>
          <para>Today the leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> and other honourable senators opposite have said that the economic implications are too far reaching for the Government to make a decision on this question now. Let me go through the history of this matter. For the whole of my lifetime I have been associated with the trade union movement. Every reform that has been made in the interests of the working class of this nation has been achieved despite the forebodings of the Conservatives. When the working week was reduced from 56 hours to 40 hours we heard the same cliches uttered as were uttered today. The same has been said in relation to equal pay for equal work  -  a principle that has been contained in ILO conventions for 16 or 17 years. Certainly it has been contained in one of the conventions to which this Government should have subscribed for the whole of its time in office. </para>
          <para>I am proud to be able - indeed I welcome the opportunity - to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> on this occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> said that if the principle of equal pay for equal work was implemented the textile industry would go out of business. In 1842 the Conservatives said that the Bank of England would close if children were not permitted to work in mines. Women and children, in their fight for equality, have been confronted with the fact that although people believe in a principle they are never willing to implement it. There was a fight when women wanted the right to vote. There was a fight when they wanted to achieve equality in other fields - even for the right to stand for election to Parliament. It was not until the 1 920s that women in Victoria were permitted to stand for election to Parliament. The same argument that is being used today can be found in the Hansard reports of that period. </para>
          <para>On this occasion Government supporters have done their utmost to try to defend a position which is absolutely indefensible. They have tried to show that they are as keen as we are to implement the policy of equal pay for equal work. The reason why they have to get up and say that they believe in this principle is that it is contained in the official federal platform of the Liberal Party of Australia, as approved by the Federal Council of that Party. Clauses 74 to 92 deal with employment and industry. Clause 85 states that one of the objectives of the Party is the recognition of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> was prepared to read it out, but he is not prepared to implement it. That is the difference between members of the Labor Party and Government supporters. Government supporters are not prepared to buck the official policy of the Party. They say: &#39;Although this Is a matter with which we agree in principle, in no circumstances must we implement it.&#39; It has been argued that arbitration tribunals, not the Government, should implement this principle. Let me throw this argument into the melting pot and see what the result will be. The Government would not break any precedent if it legislated or moved into the administrative field to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work. There is a precedent for this move. In at least four States of the Commonwealth legislation has been introduced to provide for equal pay for equal work. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The precedent has also been established by arbitration tribunals. I have worked in industries in which the awards provide for equal pay. In the case of tram drivers in Victoria, provision for the payment of equal pay was inserted in the award with the cooperation of the State Government. Many other awards in Victoria provide for equal pay for equal work. The principle applies in some of the Commonwealth services and it also applies in some State services. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> referred to arbitration authorities which have indicated quite clearly that they believe that the economic and social problems associated with equal pay for equal work are such that they should be handled at a legislative level. </para>
          <para>The arguments that have been advanced one after another by honourable senators opposite are not worthy of any consideration. Although this Government professes to believe in the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, since at least  1953  it has said that that principle cannot be implemented today or tomorrow. The present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> is on record as saying in  1958  that he was not opposed to the principle of equal pay for equal work. If that is the Government&#39;s policy, it should do something positive to assist in the conciliatory discussions that would take place if applications were made to have this principle implemented. The Government could assist greatly by ensuring that the arbitration tribunals receive sympathetically any application from the trade union movement instead of advocating before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as it has done in national wage cases in recent years, that the basic wage, as it was previously, and now the total wage not be increased, because the economy of the country cannot stand an increase. </para>
          <para>I believe that the Australian Labor Party this afternoon has done a great service to the women of Australia and indeed to the cause of equal pay throughout Australia. We on this side of the Senate this afternoon have clearly shown that the Government does not intend at any time to implement any of the decisions of the International Labour Organisation relating to equal pay or to assist employees in any application for implementation of this principle. What honourable senators opposite are saying they are saying in terms in which for centuries reforms aimed at adoption of the principle of equal pay and equal rights throughout a nation have been opposed. I believe that I have said sufficient, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> to indicate that we on this side of the chamber want equal pay for equal work to be implemented as quickly as possible. I now intend to test the sincerity of the Government in relation to the principles upon which it professes to stand. Accordingly,  1  move: </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> we have become rather accustomed to urgency motions on matters having no urgency. Since 19tb April, the Australian Labor Party has presented six urgency motions. In addition, there has been one proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus.</inline> That was the only one relating to a matter that had any degree of urgency. It concerned the soliciting of funds for North Vietnam. Since 19th April, we have spent almost 18 hours discussing matters of no urgency. What urgency was there about water conservation that it should have been debated on 19th April? On 22nd August, the Chowilla Dam project was discussed as a matter of urgency. I put it frankly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne,</inline> who is interjecting, that nothing that is said here will alter the situation in Victoria. Was there any need to debate that project as a matter of urgency on 22nd August? Trade with China was another subject raised as a matter of urgency. But that was of no urgency at all. Such trade has been going on for years. So what was the urgency that required discussion of it here? Power and water development projects in Queensland also were discussed in a debate on an urgency motion. The only urgency seen by the Opposition then was due to the fact that an election was pending in Queensland. Yesterday, we debated an urgency motion relating to losses to fruit growers caused by the closure of the Suez Canal and consequent delays to shipping. This may be a matter of great importance to the fruit growers of South Australia and Tasmania, but what was the urgency that required its discussion in the Senate? </para>

          <para>I now come to the matter that is before us today - equal pay for equal work. The terms in which the motion of urgency has been proposed are interesting. The adjournment of the Senate has been proposed for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgency, namely: </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>showed that the charge that the Government has failed to honour its international obligations is absolutely without foundation. I shall come back to that later. I recognise that the subject of equal pay for work of equal value is important, but what is the urgency that requires it to be discussed today? I understand that an equal pay week is being held. Apparently, therefore, there has suddenly developed an urgent need to devote 3 hours of the Senate&#39;s time to a debate on this subject today, though we have on the business paper other matters of exceedingly great importance, particularly the proposed expenditures of the Commonwealth for the current financial year. We have to discuss these proposed expenditures in considerable detail. </para>

              <para>- This may be the next one. Even if this motion were carried, what effect would it have? Would it bring equal pay for equal work any nearer? I do not think it would. One is left to draw only one conclusion, that is, that this is no more than another political propaganda exercise, to try to gain, with a Senate election coming on, some kudos by posing as great champions of equal pay for women. The Government has made its attitude over many years quite clear. I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> for quoting from the Liberal Parly platform. I do not run away from that, lt is because of this platform that we stand and say that we do not oppose the principle of equal pay. We support it and have supported it for years. Our attitude :s quite clear. We believe that this is not a matter for governments to legislate on. This is a matter for &#39;he appropriate wages tribunals of Australia to decide upon. </para>

              <para>- I am very charitable with the honourable senator but it may not last much longer. This does not bind the Government to legislate. The Government&#39;s attitude is quite clear. It is accepted and acknowledged by the Party that this is a matter for the wages tribunals of Australia to decide upon. This is a matter of great economic importance to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> might find it a laughing matter. Indeed, he apparently regards the whole question of equal pay for equal work as a laughing matter. This may be the Opposition&#39;s attitude. This matter may be brought up today as some sort of joke, because ever since I started to speak <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has been laughing about it. He apparently finds it a laughing matter. To us, it is not. Where we disagree with the Opposition is on the question of who makes this decision, whether it is the Government by legislation or the properly constituted wages tribunals. We stand quite clearly and unequivocally on this issue. It is a matter to be decided by the wages tribunals and it should have been brought before them. When I looked at the records I found that the Australian Council of Trade Unions raised this matter before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court in 1949 and it has not raised the matter since. It could have done so at the last wages hearing but it did not do so. 1 do not think that any trade unions have raised this matter with their properly constituted wages tribunals. They do not want to. If this is a matter of some great principle, of great urgency, of great moment, why did not the ACTU raise it again? </para>

            <para>- 1. oppose the motion. It is about time that we had men with independent minds prepared to sit on Committees in which they may be outvoted. The Senate will do a great disservice to the people of Canberra if it accepts <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson&#39;s</inline> resignation. He should be asked to reconsider the whole matter and we should not pass this motion. It is not often that we see a member of a party prepared to get up and buck his party. I know he has done this on previous occasions. It means, of course, the end of preferment for him but I do not think that that worries <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson.</inline> When someone of an independent spirit is prepared to rise and state a case but finds that he has to resign in order to do so it is a sad day for the Parliament if it accepts his resignation. </para>

          <para>This affects all of the people of Canberra, not just the Minister himself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson&#39;s</inline> reasons are valid reasons for the Government to take note of. The Government should try to change the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> should stay on the Committee until such time as, by maintaining this attitude, he forces the Government to change the terms of reference of the Committee. I for one am prepared to- oppose the motion and ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> to reconsider bis resignation with a view to the Parliament&#39;s obtaining a change in the terms of reference. </para>

            <para>- I want to speak briefly in opposition to the motion. If a man wants to resign I do not think we can do other than accept his resignation. But this resignation emphasises the futility of this Committee which can do nothing or has very limited power and seems to be a waste of time. The resignation is being made as a protest at the limited power being given to the Committee at a time when the senator resigning from it believes there is work for the Committee to do. On the question of whether or not the complaint is justified I find some support from the remarks last night of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline> who is a delegate from the Australian Labor Party to this Committee. He said that there was justification for the grievance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> and that it may be only a short time before all members of the Committee find it necessary to follow this example. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When members of the Committee seem almost unanimous in believing that the Committee cannot function as it should function, rather than just replace one member of it who has emphasised and shown up this weakness we should seek some declaration from the Government or the Minister on how this weakness is to be overcome, or we should seek from the Senate an expression that it does not approve of the continuation of a Committee, which practically all members of it find cannot function in an efficient and proper manner in carrying out the work that the Parliament which appointed it thought it should carry out. </para>

            <para>- I realise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> has freedom of choice in the action he is taking. 1 am sure that he has given the matter consideration. However, I would like to tell honourable senators that during the period of time 1 served on the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I found it to bc the most frustrating, useless and timewasting exercise that I have yet been associated with in the Parliament. In this particular sphere the Parliament is only a tool of the Executive. References to the Committee are sent along in the manner of dropping a few crumbs for it to feed on while the main decisions are being made on the Executive and bureaucratic level. </para>

              <para>- That is so. The Committee has made great efforts to establish a dialogue and to get communication with the Minister, to try to get through the point that it is interested in the development of Canberra from the great concept that Burley Griffon originally offered for us to follow in the manner of the land itself and the planning of the city. Canberra is regarded as a magnificently planned city. The plan should be continued and developed under the watchful eye of the Parliament itself. Yet this Committee, which is supposed to have the responsibility of carrying out its duties on behalf of fellow members of the Parliament and to report back to the Parliament on what is happening, is given tasks that stultify the hopes of its members that they can contribute something to the planning of the development of Canberra. </para>

When I was a member of the Committee we were bogged down in correspondence with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Freeth,</inline> the Minister for the Interior at that time. In his correspondence he gave us to understand that we did not count for anything and that we were only wasting our time in corresponding with him. I felt then exactly as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> feels now. I wanted to throw in the towel. I reconsidered my position and stayed on the Committee until I had served my period of time. I sympathise with the honourable senator and I understand the agony he has been through because of the frustration encountered as a member of a committee which is able to get nowhere very slowly. </para>

If I were to do so I believe that I would lay myself open to the charge that I was engaging in political manoeuvre. I would not want my sincerity doubted. I am grateful for what has been said. If my resignation should bring forth what I think the charter of the Committee should be, that would be a different matter. Perhaps in the future I would put my name forward and again seek to be appointed to the Committee, but at this time I could not withdraw my request for discharge from the Committee. </para>

            <para>-  I will be brief. I also oppose the motion, for the reasons that have already been put forward. In opposing the motion we have a feeling of sympathy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> in being placed in the intolerable position of being a Liberal Party member of a Committee appointed to advise a member of the Australian Country Party. It is most unfortunate that this coalition is having a disastrous impact, not only on members of committees but also on members of the Cabinet who are finding the position intolerable. No doubt the precedent set today will be followed by a number of Ministers - even senior Ministers - and the coalition will be finished. I believe we ought to feel some sympathy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson,</inline> who as a member of the Liberal Party has found it intolerable to work under a Minister who is a member of the Australian Country Party. </para>

If you will permit me, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, as</inline> a member of that Committee, I would like to point out to the Senate, as I did during the debate on the adjournment of the Senate last night, that I can understand readily the frustration experienced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson.</inline> Quite frankly, I was considering very seriously whether I should follow his example. However, certain difficulties are involved. I was appointed to the Committee as a member of the Opposition and I thought that I should first of all convey to my Party any decision I would make. I think the Senate should understand that it is not of much use for both Houses of the Parliament to appoint committees to do specific things if useful work and activity do not spring from the efforts of those committees. </para>

              <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting I was informing the Senate that the Australian Capital Territory Committee had felt some disquiet for some time because of the serious restrictions placed upon its activities by the charter under which it operates. I do not want to misinform the Senate or lead the Senate to believe that this is something that has just happened of recent date. We knew, of course, when we first went on to the Committee that we would, deal only with such matters as were referred to us by the Minister for the Interior. As one who takes a very keen interest in the development and growth of Canberra, I was hoping over the long period that I have been associated with the Committee that the Minister would see fit to refer many more matters to it. I was hoping that he would refer to us matters covering a much wider scope than those with which we have been dealing. This feeling, communicating itself to other members of the Committee, has culminated in the matter under discussion tonight - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson&#39;s</inline> resignation from the Committee. I do not intend to canvass <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson&#39;s</inline> resignation very much other than to say that, in the light of circumstances now, he might feel that he would like to reconsider his decision. But that is up to him. I for one feel that it would not bc proper for the rest of the Committee to adopt the stand he has taken, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister has now indicated that he is prepared to refer to the Committee the question of the control of the sub-division of freehold lands in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

              <para>-  I do not want to say anything that is wrong, but I think this may have some connection with a recent action of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I do not want to confuse the issue by introducing a matter which is not yet before the Senate but which may have some relation to the present discussion, lt is quite obvious, that the decision of the Minister could be related to the circumstances surrounding a recent action of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Be that as it may, at least the proposal to give the Committee, for the first time since I have been associated with it, an opportunity to get its teeth into something that will be of interest to it and perhaps of some benefit to the citizens of Canberra is a good one. This proposal was accepted by the Australian Capital Territory Committee at its meeting, and we also agreed unanimously to ask the Minister to refer to the Committee for similar inquiry questions relating to city industrial and commercial leases for it is in this field that a considerable amount of dissatisfaction and disquiet has been expressed. </para>

              <para>- That is so but the Committee did not accept that as final. It requested the Minister to reconsider his attitude and refer to the Committee questions relating to industrial and commercial leases in the city, about which there has been so much criticism. It might be as well if I inform the Senate that over the last 3 or 4 months, since this question of industrial and commercial leases became a burning one, the Committee has been inundated with correspondence from business concerns and citizens who feel that they are being unjustly treated under the existing system. Some have claimed that others have secured unfair advantages as a result of decisions made with respect to commercial and industrial leases in the city. I have a pile of this type of correspondence, as has every other member of the Committee and no doubt the people who sent it in acted in the belief that this Committee had some real authority. Unfortunately we have had to inform our correspondents that this is not so. In effect, we had to admit - reluctantly on my part - that the Committee was little more than a rubber stamp. The present set up in relation to commercial and industrial leases in the city has become a matter of great public interest and, as I said earlier, 1 think the Senate, should be told something about it. </para>

          <para>It might be appropriate also if I told the Senate about some of the Committee&#39;s activities. The title &#39;Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory Committee&#39; is a very imposing one. It certainly lends itself to the thought that the Committee would be considering all sorts of interesting matters relating to the development and progress of the ACT. But the Committee acts only when the Minister thinks fit to refer to it a matter such as the sub-division of a new area, and the strict limitations placed upon the Committee&#39;s activities are starkly revealed by the fact that it has power to consider only such aspects as the width of roads, access to blocks and the location of roads surrounding shopping centres. Our activities virtually begin and end at that level. </para>
          <para>There is one point that I wish to make to the Senate and I think the Senate should digest it well. In carrying out the restricted activities that I have mentioned, the Committee meets officers of the Department of Interior and other officers connected wilh progress and developmental activities. They are all men of tremendous ability and I emphasise that they often have much greater powers and authority than have the men who comprise this Committee. Indeed, when we measure the meagre amount of Authority which we have as members of the Committee against that of the men who advise the Committee from time to time on the limited activities which I have outlined, we must wonder whether the Committee ought to be given much more authority. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt whatever in my mind that the Committee will not be able to function properly until such time as the Minister sees fit to widen its activities considerably and greatly increase its authority. An all parly committee of both houses of the Parliament should be able to lend a tremendous amount of drive and assistance to the development of the ACT. More important still, it could act as a buffer between the big brotherism which seems to have developed at the top level and the people of the ACT who feel they are being very sadly used in many directions in connection with i he subdivision of freehold land and with commercial and industrial leases in the city. Both of these matters are giving rise to a great deal of concern in the ACT at the present time. </para>
          <para>I have with me some of the correspondence which 1 have no doubt has been sent to all members of that Committee. One letter from George Wimpey and Co. covers 30 or 40 pages. There are submissions from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kousal</inline> and there is a legal opinion regarding land development by private enterprise. There is a great deal of correspondence of a similar character, all indicating the concern that the people of the ACT, both businessmen and private citizens, feel because their rights are not being protected properly as a result of the Minister refusing to give the Committee an opportunity to deal with these matters and to assist them. lt is my earnest hope that the action <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> has taken - somewhat precipitate, perhaps, but nevertheless taken in good faith, I am sure, and with the best of intentions - will have one of two beneficial results. I hope, firstly, that the Minister will decide that this Committee must act in a wider sense and have greater authority than it has at present, or secondly, that at some stage in the not too distant future the other members of the Committee may feel impelled to take the same kind of action as was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson.</inline></para>

            <para>- At the outset let me say that I very much regret the action that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> has taken on this occasion. Quite frankly, I question whether any real benefit will flow from it having regard to the circumstances as they exist today. I know the great interest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> has in this matter and </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I would much prefer that he remain with the Committee to give his fellow members the benefit of his knowledge and tremendous interest. I believe that his withdrawal from this Committee will not strengthen it; rather it will have the effect of weakening it. I believe also that if other members of the Committee become as frustrated as I know he has become about the emasculated role of the Committee, to use his words, we will have ultimately a committee completely compliant, completely under the domination and control of the Minister and completely devoid of any real purpose or functional ability. So I suggest to him that he reconsider his decision. </para>
          <para>The lack of proper planning over past years of the affairs of the Australian Capital Territory has given rise to the feeling of frustration which exists not only in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> - it caused him to dissociate himself from the affairs of the Committee - but also in the minds of other members of the Committee. In 1948 or 1949 one of my Tasmanian colleagues, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> R. H. Cole, who was then Town  Clerk  of Hobart, came to the ACT and reported on the setting up of a local government authority for this area. On at least one occasion, and possibly on two occasions, since then committees of the Senate have been set up to examine the general question of ACT affairs. </para>
          <para>As a result of the interpretation of city area leases, quite a number of problems have arisen concerning which members of the Committee have been bombarded with correspondence from many sections of the Canberra community asking that some action be taken to put the matter on a proper basis. Of course the whole point is that the Committee has no power unless the Minister is prepared to refer to it matters of consideration. </para>

Other honourable senators would probably have a better appreciation of his ability and his attitude to the ACT than I have but I hope that he has those qualities in greater measure than did the previous incumbent of the office. I assume that this Committee was set up to assist in the development of the ACT and I hope that the new Minister, in his wisdom and out of the goodness of his heart and with all the other motivations that one would expect from a Minister, will call upon this Committee to determine many of the complex questions which are bedevilling the ACT at the present time. </para>

              <para>- There are many such committees and there must be a great number of pigeonholes filled with reports. As a member of this Committee I feel duty bound to express my opinion on what is happening. I have had a good deal of experience in the field of local government in my State and I know that to obtain proper control of an area one must follow the processes laid down. In the post-war years it has been common practice in the better run municipalities to set up zoning areas and to define residential areas, industrial areas and rural localities. The districts are properly zoned and the people concerned have the right to examine the relevant plans and, if they feel aggrieved, to protest against them. They have recourse lo a proper authority to determine the form that the protest will take and that protest ultimately finds its way to a properly constituted court where they have a right to state their case for or against various proposals. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>No such right exists in the ACT. We recently had before the Senate an ordinance which deprived people in residential areas of the right to institute legal proceedings. The people of the Territory should be on a  paT  with people in the remainder of Australia. They should be able to exercise their civil right of taking legal action, if necessary, to protect their leases. At the present time they may not take legal action unless the Minister gives permission for that to be done. Nowhere else in Australia are the people denied their civil rights to the extent that they are in the ACT. </para>
          <para>These are the questions which are perplexing the Committee which regards itself as a responsible body charged with protecting the rights of the people of this Territory. I do not want to prolong this debate- </para>

              <para>- I know that the Government does not like this but honourable senators opposite should bear in mind that we did not precipitate this position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson,</inline> one of their own colleagues, did so. This is quite a serious matter. It concerns the affairs of about 110,000 people in the ACT. This Territory comes under the control of the Government which ultimately, at the top level, is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the laws of this land are observed. Yet something that is enshrined in our system in the rest of Australia is denied to the people of this Territory. Surely that is not good enough. I sincerely hope that this matter will be taken up with the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> when he has settled into his new position. I assure the Senate that the members of the Joint Committee will be quite accommodating in allowing him to settle into his new duties and responsibilities, but we will want to, be able to guide him and assist him so that the people of the ACT can have the same protection of law and the same rights as the people in any other part of Australia. </para>

I think it was in 1947 or 1948 that the Town  Clerk  of Hobart came to Canberra to advise on the matter of local government. Members of the Opposition are pushed to advancing that type of argument in order to make sure that time passes by and that no reference is made to the matter of defence which, as you are well aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> is listed to be debated as soon as this motion is dealt with.

          <para>The  DEPUTY PRESIDENT-  A short time ago the Chair warned an honourable senator that the debate was going too far away from the subject matter.

              <para>- There are times when I think the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> has reached the stage where he believes that the Senate is a Sunday school, because he is so sensitive. Whenever anything is said about defence, he is so sensitive that he must stand up and take a point of order. Members of the Opposition have been running away from that matter at every opportunity. Whenever  it is raised, up they pop like a jack-in-a-box, raising points of order. We have listened to  speaker  after  speaker  from the Opposition side. They were not interrupted by interjections by us. They canvassed a wide range of matters. They wandered away from the point. But when one  speaker  from this side of the chamber stands up and points out the facts of life - namely that the members of the Opposition are running away from a debate on another subject; that they a.-e only trying to waste time; that they want to make sure that we do not get down to debating the defence of this country and the commitment of Australian troops to Vietnam </para>

What he is doing is regretting that the discussion o&#163; the defence estimates, which are listed on the notice paper, is being postponed by the Opposition. We have heard five Opposition speakers in a row speaking not to the motion before the Chair, which is that an honourable senator he discharged from service on a committee at his own request, but on the operations of a committee that is operating under terms of reference laid down by this Parliament. 1 suggest to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> that in those circumstances there is no substance in a point of order which claims that an honourable senator on this side of the chamber is not entitled to regret that members of the Opposition have been speaking on something which is not the subject matter of the debate and to regret that the discussion of the defence estimates is being put off.

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> completely misunderstood me. I referred to defence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson&#39;s</inline> action. That was all understood. Honourable senators opposite hear a word and it brings them  to  their feet  like  a jack-in-a-box. This is an interesting experience. I come to the defence - I know that is a nasty word for honourable senators opposite - of one of my colleagues who saw fit to tender his resignation from the Committee. As soon as I mentioned defence up jump honourable senators opposite, taking points of order, because they do not like reference  to  defence. I am still prepared to defend colleagues on this side whenever necessary. I see no reason why I should not speak in defence of my colleague on  this  side  just  because the Opposition does not like  the  word &#39;defence&#39; - because it runs away from the word whenever it is mentioned. I propose to use the word because I use it in the context of the motion before the Senate. </para>

          <para>It seems to me in view of the debate that has taken place that this might be an opportune time for the Leader of the Government to decide that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> has not changed his original decision, the matter might be stood over until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> has satisfied his conscience as to what his future might be on the Committee, lt seems to me that in all these things what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> has said explains a very strong motivation on the part of any Committee member. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline> in supporting what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> said about the futility of the Committee, pointed out that it might be possible to make progressive improvements to increase the responsibility of the Committee. He said that this was the reason why he and other members of the Committee had decided not to resign from the Committee. In these circumstances this seems to me to be a very good reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> and the Government should leave the position as it is at present so that the functions and strengths of the Committee might be increased in the light of the new circumstances which have been reported to the Senate. </para>

The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> has moved a motion in accordance with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson&#39;s</inline> wish. After some discussion today <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> informed the Senate that he adhered to his intentions to request the Senate to discharge him from the Committee. I suggest that the Senate has great functions to perform and important matters to decide tonight in regard to large expenditure concerning public responsibilities. I hope that the Opposition will not continue to trespass upon the time that most of us wish to have to enable us to engage in those discussions by pursuing this matter, which is really an impertinence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson&#39;s</inline> wish has been made plain and has been repeated. I rise in the hope that the Senate will acknowledge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson&#39;s</inline> right to request discharge and will allow the motion to proceed so that we can get on with the country&#39;s business and forget these frivolities. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has not stated the position properly. The obligation of a senator is to serve on a Committee if he is appointed to it. He may be appointed to a committee against his will, but it is his obligation and his duty to serve unless he is excused by the Senate. If he is a member of a committee his obligation is still to serve unless the Senate excuses him by a motion such as this. It is not a right of a senator to be excused from a committee; it is an indulgence which the Senate grants to him. In this case much has been said about the motives which have actuated <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> in asking to be discharged from the Committee. Iri is is not a mere case of some personal problem, some over-work or something of that nature which would induce the Senate, without question or discussion, to accede to his request. The basis upon which he made his request was such as to raise a serious question as to whether it should be granted. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> wishes to persist with his request. I understand also that the suggestion which has been made very well by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> that the matter should be stood over in order that further consideration may be given, will not be accepted. In these circumstances, notwithstanding the grave problems which have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> in detailing the circumstances which have caused him to ask for his discharge, I believe that the Senate should accede to his request and that we should accept this motion proposed by the Government. </para>

            <para>- in reply - If I may say so, I believe that the remarks that have just been made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> are the only sensible remarks that I have heard from the Opposition in the course of this debate. The motion which is before the Senate at the moment is not a Government motion. It is not a motion that the Government wanted to move, nor is it one that I wanted to move. It arises out of a letter written by a senator to the  President  asking for discharge from duties on a committee of the Senate. In accordance with the wishes expressed by that senator in that letter, in the normal course of Senate business I moved, on his behalf, that the Senate should discharge him from the duties from which he had asked to be discharged. I did so because that was the only way in which he could be formally discharged from that duty. It could only be done by a motion of the Senate. How silly it would be if the Senate were to say no in spite of this request, if it were to say that it would not accede to his request and would not agree to discharge him from his duties. In that event he would still be formally a member of the Committee, but nobody could make him go and work on the Committee. Nobody could arraign him and say that he must give his mind to the Committee. Surely it would not be suggested that any honourable senator who did not want to work on a committee and who had asked to be relieved from it could be forced to work on it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This is a situation which has arisen before. I have been informed by the  Clerk  of the Senate that never on any occasion has a senator who has come to the Senate and said, as a member of a committee, that he sought leave to be discharged from his duties been refused leave of the Senate to be discharged. It is his decision and his request. This is not the result of a decision by me and does not arise from a request by the Government; it is a request by a particular senator and is put to the Senate. I know that the debate has ranged over other matters. There have been questions as to whether the committee on which the honourable senator serves should operate in some way other than the way in which it now operates. But this is not tied up with this resolution and I do not propose in any way to debate the pros and cons of that proposition. The result of any decision of the Senate on this request from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> would not have any effect on that because the Committee operates under terms of reference which have been laid down by the House of Representatives and by this chamber. These terms of reference are not laid down by a Minister; they are the result of resolutions by both Houses. The result of a vote on the request of a particular senator to be relieved of his duties would in no way affect the position. For these reasons and so that we can get on with some of the country&#39;s business - though this is the country&#39;s business, too - I suggest to the Senate that the wishes of one of its members as expressed to the  President  and as conveyed in my motion be acceded to. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill declares the rates of income tax for the financial year 1967-68 on income of certain superannuation funds, trust estates and members of partnerships. The rates declared by the Bill are special rates which were declared for the first time in relation to the 1965-66 financial year for the purposes of legislation introduced in 1964 to counter tax avoidance arrangements brought to the Governments attention in the 1961 report of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. The rates have remained unchanged since they were originally introduced, and no change is proposed for the current financial year. </para>
          <para>For income of a trust estate, other than a deceased estate, to which no beneficiary is presently entitled and which is not taxed as if it were the income of one individual, the rate declared by the Bill is 50%. For income from a share in a partnership over which a person lacks, or is deemed to lack, real and effective control and disposal, the Bill imposes a further rate of tax sufficient to bring the aggregate rate on the income up to 50%. If a taxpayer&#39;s average personal rate of tax is 50% or more, no further tax is imposed under this Bill. </para>
          <para>A rate of 50% is also declared foi the taxable income of a superannuation fund that is not exempt from tax. This rate does not apply, however, to the investment income of a fund that is subject to tax only through the fund&#39;s failure to comply with the 30/20 rule concerning investments in public securities. The rates on this income are those contained in the Income Tax Bill 1967 and are the same as applied last year. 1 commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to give effect to proposals announced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> in his Budget Speech. These proposals relate to concessional deductions and to provisions affecting primary producers. The Bill proposes an increase of $26 in the amounts of concessional deductions allowable for the maintenance of dependants. The deductions for a spouse, a daughter-housekeeper, a housekeeper, an invalid relative and a parent will each be increased from $286 to $312. The deductions for a student child under 21 years of age and one child under 16 years of age will be increased from $182 to $208, and for each other child under 16 years of age from $130 to $156. </para>
          <para>An increase of $400 is proposed in the amount of the concessional deduction for payments by a taxpayer to provide super annuation or insurance benefits for himself and his family. The new limit will be $1,200 for each income year. These increases in the concessional deductions will apply to assessments for the 1967-68 income year and subsequent years. For salary and wage earners, the benefits from the increased dependants&#39; allowances are being reflected in reduced tax instalment deductions which have operated as from 1st October. </para>
          <para>The remaining amendments proposed by the Bill apply to primary producers. One amendment proposed will apply to primary producers who, because of drought, fire or flood, are forced to sell livestock. Under the present law, a primary producer who is forced to sell livestock in these circumstances may elect to have the profits of the sale taxed over a period of 5 years if the proceeds of the sale are used principally for the purpose of restocking. The Bill proposes an alternative method of bringing the profits of a forced sale to account for income tax purposes. Broadly, a primary producer who uses the proceeds of a forced sale principally for restocking may, in respect of sales in 1967-68 or a subsequent year, elect to have the profit on the sale applied to reduce the cost for income tax purposes of the replacement stock. This will have the effect of deferring payment of tax on the proceeds of a forced sale until the replacement stock are sold in the normal course of business. In some cases stock may be replaced by breeding rather than by purchase. In these circumstances, it is proposed that a primary producer may specify an amount of the profit of the forced sale to be included in his assessable income of the year in which natural increase is bred. If, by the end of the fifth year after the year in which the forced sale occurred, any amount of the profits of the sale has not been applied in either of the ways I have mentioned, the amount will be included in the assessable income of that year. In the past 2 years, the Government has introduced temporary measures to assist wool growers who, because of the drought, advanced shearing dates during the 1964-65 and 1965-66 income years. When this occurred, the proceeds of two wool clips would have been brought to account for taxation purposes in the 1 year. Provision was therefore made for these wool growers to elect to transfer the net proceeds of the second clip to the succeeding income year so that these proceeds were taxed in the year in which they would ordinarily have been received. It is proposed to continue the operation of these provisions for the 1966-67 income year and subsequent years, and to extend them also to advanced shearings brought about by fire or flood. </para>
          <para>The Bill also proposes the continuation, without any limit as to lime, of the special 20% depreciation allowances on plant and structural improvements used for primary production purposes. The final amendment proposed by the Bill is the allowance of an outright deduction in the year of incurrence for the full cost of subdivisional fencing erected on land used in primary production. At present, this fencing is generally subject to annual depreciation allowances at the special rate of 20% per annum. Boundary fences or fences around stockyards are not included in the proposal but will remain subject to depreciation allowances. The amendment will apply to expenditure incurred on subdivisional fencing during the 1967-68 income year and subsequent years. More detailed explanations of the Bill are contained in explanatory notes which are being made available to honourable senators and I do not propose to speak at greater length on the Bill at this stage.I commend it to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The Bill now before honourable senators proposes amendments to the Schedule to the Excise Tariff 1921-1967. The purpose is to enact, as from 17th March 1957, increased rates of duty on canned fruit. On the recommendation of the Australian Canned Fruits Board the rates of excise duty on canned apricots, peaches, pears and mixtures thereof are increased from 20c to 30c per dozen 29-oz cans - this is the basic con tainer size - with equivalent increases on other can sizes. It will be recalled that when the Government introduced amending legislation in 1963 to reconstitute the Australian Canned Fruits Board, it agreed to impose an excise duty on canned deciduous fruits entered for consumption within Australia so as to providethe Board with additional funds to assist the industry in developing markets for the greatly increased supplies of fruit that had become available. The proposal advanced by the industry at the time and accepted by the Government was that the maximum rate of excise duty that could be imposed would be 60c per dozen 29-oz cans with the operative rate from time to time within this ceiling to be decided on the recommendation of the Board. This proposal has the substantial support of canners and growers. </para>
          <para>The previous rate of 20c per dozen 29-oz cans yielded about $1.2m a year. This money is expended by the Board in exercising its functions under the provisions of the Canned Fruits Export Marketing Act 1963-1966 &#39;to encourage, assist and promote the exportation of canned fruits from Australia and the consumption and sale outside Australia&#39;. </para>
          <para>Over recent years there has been a large increase in the availability of canned deciduous fruits for export. Production increased from 7.3 million cartons in 1963 to an estimated 10.5 million cartons in 1967 and it is expected that the availability of fruit for canning from existing plantings will continue to grow. Home consumption accounts for about 3 million cartons a year, which means that at present pack levels about 7.5 million cartons are available for export yearly. In 1966 there was a record movement of 6.6 million cartons to overseas markets but even so the stock carryover assumed a relatively high level of 2 million cartons. Our main competitor, South Africa, is also increasing production at a fairly fast rate and has now taken over as the leading supplier in the major United Kingdom market. </para>
          <para>The funds obtained from the excise duty have enabled the industry to obtain some foothold in the major markets on the continent of Europe, particularly in Germany, where the sales level has risen from a nominal level in 1963 to about 800,000 cartons last year. The Board has also been able to intensify promotional activity in Canada with a corresponding increase in trade from 150,000 cartons in 1963 to 700,000 cartons in 1966. </para>
          <para>The Board, backed by canning interests representing a substantial proportion of production, and the central growers organisation - the Australian Canning Fruitgrowers Association - has sought the increases in duty now proposed so that additional funds will be provided for the further developmental work needed to move the increased supplies of fruit cur- rently available. The Government is fully seised of the need to give all reasonable assistance to the Board and the industry in their efforts not only to consolidate but to expand all possible overseas outlets for our canned deciduous fruits. It agrees that the Board will require additional revenue for the purpose at this stage. Accordingly it has been pleased to accept the Board&#39;s recommendation which, at present home consumption levels, will provide an additional $600,000 in a full year. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- For the purpose of the matters that I wish to raise, I relate my remarks in the first instance to Division No. 640, which provides for administration in the Department of Defence. The summary at page 152 of Document Alets out the following proposed expenditures: Department of Defence, $17.816m; Department of the Navy, $193. 132m; Department of the Army, $366. 102m; Department of Air, $297.71 lm; Department of Supply, $85.726m; and General Services, $ 1.830m. All these sums add up to an astronomical total. So while one might like to raise general questions relating to the Service Departments on the astronomical increase in defence expenditure particularly in the last 2 or 3 years, it is difficult to deal with them individually under the estimates for the Department of Defence. I suppose one has to wait until the proposed appropriations for the Department of Air, the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Army are before the Committee. </para>

              <para>- I want to make clear to the Minister and to the Committee that I shall raise certain matters when the estimates for the Service Departments are before the Committee. If the Minister thinks that the matter to which I am about to refer relates to another department, such as the Department of the Treasury, I should like him to say so at an early stage so that I will not waste the time of the Committee now. Under Division No. 640, which relates to administrative expenses of the Department of Defence, I want to say something about the administration of the Defence Services Canteen Trust Fund. I understand that the Minister for Defence is the Minister appointed to administer the Defence Services Canteen Trust Fund Act, so I assume that this matter comes within the jurisdiction of his Department. </para>

However, under Division No. 645 at page 153, which relates to the recruiting campaign, we see that provision is made for salarier of the staff of the Recruiting Directorate, for which the proposed appropriation is $64,500. </para>

              <para>- That is what I am saying. So far as I can see, there is in the Estimates no indication to the Parliament of the number of officers in the Department of Defence engaged on specific recruiting campaign activities. As it is the Government&#39;s intention to send more than 1,000 additional troops to Vietnam in the very near future and as a great many of these will be national servicemen, it is surprising indeed to me that the expenditure for advertising under item 04 of subdivision 2 of division No. 645, which relates to the recruiting campaign, is expected to be exactly the same this financial year as it was last financial year. Bearing in mind the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> yesterday and also the envisaged increases in the establishments of the Army, Navy and Air Force, I should have thought that the Government would have been committing itself to larger expenditure in order to attract volunteers to the three arms of the Services. Perhaps the Minister might explain the break-up of the expenditure under this item, that is, the expenditure on Press campaign advertising, radio campaign advertising and television campaign advertising. In 1964 in another place the then Minister for Defence was asked how much would be spent on Press, radio and television advertising. As an ancilliary question he was asked how much would be spent in country areas in the financial year. He replied that the amounts spent on provincial advertising would be: Press, &#163;39,000; radio, &#163;8,000; television, nil. Of course, since 1964 television services throughout Australia have expanded considerably. There is a much wider contact and a much wider coverage. The amount involved is $1,300,000. The Minis ter should be able to give us some indication of how this expenditure is disbursed. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I refer now to the entry in relation to a community survey, which appears in sub-division 2 of Division No. 645. I note that last year there was an expenditure of $7,000 and that no appropriation is proposed this year for this purpose. I should like to know what was involved in the community survey, how far it extended and what was its purpose. When one knows the amounts spent by public relations companies in conducting surveys, one realises that $7,000 would be considered to be a mere drop in the bucket. I should like some indication of the effectiveness of the survey. Finally, I refer to division No. 648, which relates to plant and equipment. There is just a bald statement that the appropriation is for plant and equipment. No indication is given of the particular nature of the expenditure. This year the appropriation has been reduced considerably below last year&#39;s expenditure. This year the appropriation is $324,100 as against last year&#39;s expenditure of $905,801. Doubtless the Department through the Minister can explain the reason for the reduction, but I suggest that it would be much easier to understand if the Department were to set out in documentary fashion an outline of the types of expenditure involved under a broad heading of this nature, without itemising individual purchases. They are the matters I wish to raise at this stage in connection with the estimates for the Defence Services. I emphasise that other very specific matters will need to be debated and discussed by the Senate when we are dealing with the estimates for the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Army and Department of Air. </para>

              <para>- When the estimates of the Department of the Army are being debated I think the honourable senator will find that there is no item of appropriation for the Fund. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> also asked about people employed in recruiting, for whom an appropriation of $64,500 is made in Division No. 645 - Recruiting Campaign. The appropriation is to pay the salaries of officers of the Department of Defence who are engaged in recruiting; that is to say, the salaries of the Director of Recruiting, the Assistant Director and staff of the Recruiting Directorate, together with the salaries of certain staff directly employed in recruiting and information centres. This is not the sole salary component of expenditure on recruiting. I understand that the Services themselves provide officers under the direction of the Director-General of Recruiting who are paid out of the specific Services votes. I repeat that the appropriation for item 01 of sub-division 1 of Division No. 645 is for the Director of Recruiting, the Assistant Director and his staff, and some staff directly employed in recruiting and information centres. The increased appropriation this year is the result of  a  rise of $1,100 in salaries because of a new salary determination and the filling of  a  new position for part of the year. I do not have for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> precise information as to the number of staff who are working for the Assistant Director. I do not know whether it is available. I would like to get it for the honourable senator if I could. </para>

              <para>asked about the results obtained from the expenditure on advertising. I can give him only the recruiting figures for the Services for 1966-67. For the Navy there were 8,920 applications for enlistment; for the Army 12,673 applications; and for the Air Force 7,350 applications. I cannot tell him, nor do I believe that anybody else can tell him, how many of these applications would have been made if there had been no advertising and how many of them are attributable to advertising. As has always been the case, the number of acceptances was much lower than the number of applications. This is because some applicants failed to measure up to medical and educational requirements, and so on. In 1966-67, enlistments in the Navy totalled 2,364; in the Army, they numbered 3,292 and in the Air Force 2,279. That is the end result of our efforts to recruit people to our three Services. </para>

          <para>I have no doubt whatever that those figures would drop considerably if advertising were not engaged in, but 1 could not attempt to estimate the degree to which they would drop. I think all fair-minded senators will agree that the standard of advertising for recruitment in Australia is very good. The Press advertising, of course, one just reads, but the radio and, more particularly, the television advertising, has always impressed me as an individual as being a very good type of advertising very well carried out. That is all I can say. I could do no more than estimate - and my estimate would be no better than anybody else&#39;s - what part of the final result was due to advertising or what the result, would have been if there had been no advertising. </para>

            <para>- I wish to draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the amount spent on the recruiting campaign over the past 5 or 6 years. I should like him or his officers to explain why it is that about the same figure has been expended each year on advertising. The amount to be appropriated this year is $1.3m, and that has been about the average figure expended in each of the past 5 or 6 years. I emphasise that this figure was the amount expended on advertising during the years before the introduction of the compulsory call-up under the national service training scheme. I remember that in those days the Government was seeking to attract volunteers to the reserves, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> practically admitted that the recruiting campaign seeking to attract volunteers was a failure. </para>

              <para>- It was because of this that the Government introduced the national service training scheme under which men are called up compulsorily. Because enlistment is compulsory the need for expenditure on advertising should disappear and I emphasise that the national service trainees now comprise approximately 90% of our Army personnel. I would have thought that with the introduction of compulsory national service training the cost of obtaining a full complement of troops for Vietnam would be cut considerably. But it has remained at much the same figure. I should like to know why the Department has not been able to cut the cost of advertising by at least 50%. I have made many inquiries into this matter, and I am convinced that the Government has not been really interested in volunteers over the last 5 or 6 years but has been working more towards full reliance upon the national service training scheme. Despite this, the advertising costs have remained the same. I would like an explanation of this, if there is one. </para>

The Minister said in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that he should not be expected to be able to produce figures showing the amount of expenditure incurred in obtaining a given number of recruits. I would say that any properly organised efficient advertising department would be able to do that. With modern advertising of such things as foodstuffs or other commodities the agents can produce accurate figures as to the results obtained from advertising campaigns. I am surprised to hear the Minister say that the officers of the Department of the Army cannot give him some indication of the enlistment results from a given expenditure. </para>

          <para>I have been watching this position over the years. I have seen that the amount appropriated has remained constant. I repeat that I would have thought that with the introduction of national service training, for which no advertising is needed, the cost of the recruiting campaign would have been cut by at least half. The appropriation for this year for the whole of Division No. 645 is $1,573,500, and we are just about to call up another group of men. I should think that these men will be called up under the national service scheme which requires no expenditure on advertising. This appears to me to be a case of very loose accounting and I would like an explanation from the Minister. </para>

            <para>- I refer first to Division No. 645, subdivision 2, item 04, which relates to advertising. Can the Minister tell me the method by which the Defence Department carries out its advertising? Is it done through private organisations, or does the Department do its own advertising? If contracts are let to private organisations, can the Minister explain the manner in which contracts are arranged? I also have the same interest as other honourable senators in obtaining a clarification of the almost constant appropriation of $1.3m over the years for advertising costs. </para>

          <para>I refer now to Division No. 640, subdivision 2, item 05, which relates to the hire and maintenance of plant and equipment. The appropriation for this item is $335,300 and the amount actually expended last year was $250,248. What is it within the defence complex that we are hiring today? One would imagine that it would be office equipment or automatic data processing equipment, but I thought that the defence Services had equipment of this type of their own. </para>
          <para>I come now to defence Services generally, and what I have said with relation to the Department of Defence applies also here. Although the total allocation for Defences Services is approximately $662m I am concerned about the proposed expenditure of almost $18m, an enormous sum of money, by the Department of Defence. I think the people generally are reluctant to take too much notice of the accuracy of expenditure in this direction. I have read with interest comments which the AuditorGeneral has made and one would be inclined to hold the view that the people believe that there should not be too much investigation into expenditure in the various areas of defence. This perhaps is reflected in insufficient control being exercised by those persons who have been given the job of controlling accounting procedures within this and other defence Services. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps I could say Division No. 640. I was speaking generally in relation to the Department of Defence because the Auditor-General&#39;s comments on the whole defence area indicate in this year 1967 some carelessness in the control of accounting whether it be within Australia or overseas. One probably could instance many occasions on which the AuditorGeneral has had occasion to say either that an internal audit is insufficient or that the control of financing, even in relation to some of our overseas contracts, is entirely insufficient. I hope that the AuditorGeneral, in his report next year, will not have cause to comment about overpayments or insufficient control in accounting procedures in the defence Services. </para>

              <para>- I am advised that some of them do control media of their own but they are- not connected with broadcasting stations. I may have to amplify that statement later. Nevertheless, I believe there is no financial advantage to those people. I was asked about the hire and maintenance of plant and equipment. The honourable senator was correct; most of it is office equipment. Some $76,000 is provided to cover the cost of the hire of office machines, the cost of computer processing of overseas data and the maintenance of office machines for the Defence Cataloguing Authority, and there is allocation of $4,900 to meet the cost of recurring maintenance on office machines. Tn the electronic data processing group $139,000 is provided for the maintenance of computer equipment, $18,000 for the maintenance of flexowriters, tape certification equipment and miscellaneous machines and equipment, as well as $8,000 for shop repairs. </para>

          <para>In the Joint Intelligence Division provision is made for $3,400 for the maintenance of miscellaneous office machines, and in the Defence Signals Division there is an allocation of $36,000 for the hire of punch card equipment; an allocation of $34,000 for replacement parts and the modification, repair and maintenance of machines; an allocation of $10,000 for spares for computer and air conditioning maintenance, and an allocation of $6,000 for tools and workshop necessities including expendable materials for maintenance. The bulk of this expenditure is for maintenance although the hire of some punch card equipment and some office machines is also included. </para>
          <para>I think the last matter the honourable senator raised related to accounting procedures and, in particular, to overpayments which have been criticised by the AuditorGeneral. My recollection - I think it is cor rect - is that those criticisms were directed against Treasury accountants overseas, particularly in the United States, who had made mistakes of that kind, rather than against any internal audit accountants of the Department of Defence. I think that is what the honourable senator has in his mind. Indeed, I think this matter is engaging the attention of the Public Accounts Committee which is now talking to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harris,</inline> a Treasury official concerned with this aspect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> said that he thought the advertising appropriation should be cut. </para>

              <para>- That is the impression I gained. He believed the advertising appropriation should be cut because national service is providing a number of servicemen. This is a rather different attitude from that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> who said he thought the appropriation should be increased. To <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> I say that the Army is calling up compulsorily more people, but the Army is not the only Service with which we are concerned. The Navy is made up entirely of volunteers who have signed on for long terms. So is the Air Force. Those Services have expanded considerably. I think the Navy now is twice the size it was, in relation to manpower, when I was Minister for the Navy. The Air Force has also expanded. However, u remains true that the Army cannot be built on short term national service trainees. There must be a constant and growing core of long term regular soldiers to provide the nucleus to keep the whole thing going. We need 10,500 volunteers in this- current year for this purpose. As the number of short term national service trainees grows, there is a requirement for an increase in the regular component of the Army. </para>

          <para>I do not think the other point <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> raised is quite valid. 1 know that a company can expend a certain amount of money on advertising toothpaste and can say: &#39;As a result of our expenditure on the advertising campaign in this district our sales have increased to this extent&#39;. Maybe that can be worked out. Expenditure on advertising may be an allowable deduction for income tax purposes. There may be some incentive to spend money on advertising for that reason. Maybe advertising agents are pretty good at selling things. Any way, eventually this kind of judgment is made. But I do not think that can be done in this field. Nor do I think - &#39;and I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland&#39;s</inline> suggestion - that it is necessarily wise to expand considerably in this area. 1 believe that what is needed is a fairly constant, steady level of advertising to keep the requirements before the public. If we try to saturate the market or to increase the advertising by, say, 50%, the extra return that we would or would not obtain from that is a matter of judgment. But it k not a matter of judgment - or, if it is, it is a judgment with which I agree - that we need to maintain fairly constant level of advertising of the opportunities in the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. We certainly should not let our advertising drop below that level. </para>

            <para>- I did not intend to speak at all on this section of the Estimates but after listening to some of the evasive answers given by the Minister I feel impelled to ask questions too. The appropriation for office requisites and equipment, stationery and printing under Division No. 640 shows a tremendous increase over the expenditure last year. Whilst somebody is in touch with the position, 1 do not think the Minister&#39;s answer to a previous question about this item was complete. Last financial year the expenditure on this item was $289,962. This year the appropriation has been increased to $367,400. That is quite a substantial increase. We should be given more details of how that great increase has been brought about. I do not want to hear the excuse that it is .caused by increases in wages and salaries, or something like that. That is a favourite Government excuse for increases in expenditure which are not always brought about by that factor. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also refer to the appropriation for the hire and maintenance of plant and equipment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> who has now left the chamber, asked questions about this item. The Minister gave some figures which covered only part of the total appropriation. Those figures might have satisfied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> but they do not satisfy me. Unless I did not hear the Minister correctly, he said that advertising agents in </para>
          <para class="block">Australia were providing free advertising out of their patriotic hearts. If the Government is receiving free services, I say that it should do the same as industry does and pay the appropriate fee for the service that is rendered, whatever it may be. If the Government did that we might have decent advertising. Perhaps the reason why the Government has fallen down in this field is that it is getting second rate advertisers to do the job for it. It is obvious that the advertising is false. </para>
          <para>Many youngsters in the Navy have told me at various times that they were carried away by the deceptiveness of the advertising for the Navy. The advertisments say: &#39;Join the Navy and see the world&#39;. But these youngsters finish up on some land base, peeling spuds in the kitchen. A similar situation exists in the Army. Its advertising says: &#39;Join the Army and learn a trade&#39;. But half of the men who go into the Army are unable to cope with the civilian world when they come out at the end of their period of training because they have not learnt a trade. Their parents were tricked into letting them join that arm of the Services. This may be put down to deceptive advertising. </para>
          <para>The Air Force advertising says: &#39;Join the Air Force and be a pilot&#39;. But the number of youngsters who are finally selected as pilots is only a fraction of the number who join the Air Force with a spirit of adventure motivating them. If they are really unlucky, they will finish up as Mirage pilots and be killed anyway. </para>

Only the best pilots are selected for those aircraft, in spite of the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> tells us that they are used for training purposes. A fellow cannot fly a VIP aircraft and eat pie in the sky and sausage rolls unless he is an expert pilot. 1 refer now to the appropriation for medical fees in Division No. 645. Last year the expenditure was $82,013. This year the appropriation is $86,000. Who receives these medical fees? Do they go to private practitioners? Do they go to general hospitals? In respect of whom are these medical fees paid? Are they national service trainees? Are they members of the Citizen Military Forces? Are these fees for medical inspections of recruits or merely of some of the aged recruiting officers whom the Services have and who need extra medical attention? </para>

          <para>I wish to make one point in respect of the appropriation for advertising. Although the Government indulges in half page and full page advertisements in the metropolitan Press and to a greater degree in advertisements on metropolitan television stations, in the area from which I come - north Queensland - we hardly ever see a recruiting advertisement. According to the records, Queensland in general and Queensland country districts in particular supply more recruits for some of the Services than do other parts of the Commonwealth with comparable populations. Is that because Queensland is plagued with unemployment from time to time? Does the Government believe that it does not need to advertise in Queensland, particularly in the country areas, because in those areas, as a result of the seasonal nature of employment, most of the young people find themselves in dead end labouring occupations, are unable to make their way in civilian life and therefore are forced to enter one of the Services in order to earn an ordinary living. I have made those points because I was provoked into doing so by the Minister fobbing everybody off. In other words, he gave other honourable senators only enough information to keep them quiet. I am surprised at his doing that only two days after his elevation to the position of Leader of the Government in the Senate. </para>

This year&#39;s appropriation is to be spent as follows: On the purchase of overseas item indent data, books, materials for reproducing forms and punch cards, printing the Defence Manual and copy-strip materials for the Defence Cataloguing Authority, $82,500; on general stationery requirements, $57,200; on the printing of the Defence Report and other pamphlets and books, $7,500; on stationery requirements at overseas posts, $5,000; on the purchase of security stationery and the purchase and maintenance of safes and combination locks, $2,000; on the purchase of books, maps and papers, $2,000; on the purchase of office machines, $1,000; and on the printing and special stationery requirements for industrial mobilisation courses, $700. The total of those figures is $157,900. Dealing with electronic data processing, an amount of $69,000 Ls set aside for special stationery including magnetic and paper tape. An amount of $7,500 is provided for special printing and reproduction services. For books for branch use the sum of $4,000 is provided and $1,500 is provided for office machines.

              <para>- I do not think I should weary the Senate with these figures. Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has alleged, 1 did give the full information. Let me run through it again. For the Executive the sum of $76,000 is provided for hire of office machines, cost of computer processing of overseas data and maintenance of office machines for the Defence Cataloguing Authority. The sum of $4,900 is provided for recurring maintenance of office machines. This gives a total for the Executive of $80,900. For electronic data processing, the sum of $139,000 is provided for maintenance of computer equipment, $18,000 for maintenance of flexowriters, tape certification equipment and miscellaneous machines and equipment, and $8,000 for shop repairs, giving a total of $165,000. For the Joint Intelligence Division the sum of $3,400 is provided for maintenance of miscellaneous office machines. In the Defence Signals Division $36,000 is provided for the hire of punched card equipment, $34,000 for replacement parts, modification, repair and maintenance of machines, $10,000 for spares for computer and air conditioning maintenance, and $6,000 for tools and workshop necessities including expendable materials for maintenance, giving a total of $86,000. This gives a grand total for item 05 of $335,300. 1 do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> was justified in claiming that information had been withheld on this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> also referred to the proposed expenditure of $86,000 under Division No. 645, subdivision 2, item 03. This refers to expenditure on medical fees. The item provides for the payment of fees to medical practitioners for the medical examination of volunteers for the Permanent and Citizen Forces. They are civilian doctors and there is a set scale of fees laid down by the Treasury. The increase this year is due to an increase in the scale of fees and because of the fact that, where necessary, recruits are sent to specialists whereas formerly this type of examination was carried out by the Services. If a man goes to a general practitioner for a medical examination for recruitment and it is thought that he has something wrong with an ear or an eye requiring the opinion of a specialist, that man would be sent to a specialist and the vote for the Department of Defence would meet the specialist&#39;s fee. Formerly the Service vote would have met the fee. </para>

              <para>- I did not say that advertisements were inserted in media free of charge. I said that an advertising council was formed to give advice free of charge to the Department of Defence concerning the medium to use and the layout of advertisements. Nobody has ever said that the hiring of newspaper space or the drawing up of advertisements was free of charge. The council of advertising firms gives advice to the Government on the best method of conducting its campaign. This is done without fee. Our advertising is in newspapers, periodicals, on the radio and on television. None of these media is owned by members of the advertising council which gives advice to the Government. Those members are advertising experts who use media owned by other people. They are advertising agents; advertising firms. They do not own television stations, radio stations or newspapers. The radio stations, television stations and newspapers charge the same rates as they would charge anybody else advertising. The advice is given by people who do not own the media and therefore they do not get a rake off because the Government uses a particular media. </para>

            <para>- I refer to Division No. 652 which deals with defence aid for Malaysia and Singapore. 1 imagine that the provision under this Division is a reflection of the statement in the Budget that $6. 2 86m would be given to Malaysia and Singapore for defence aid. Expenditure last year under this heading amounted to $8,036,462, the amount appropriated being $8.235m. Will the Minister say why so much less is being sought this year than was sought or spent, last year? Having regard to the recent statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> on Britain&#39;s withdrawal from this part of the world it does not seem realistic to be reducing our expenditure on defence aid in this region. However, there may be provisions under other headings to take care of any future programme on defence which the Australian Government may have in mind in the light of changed international events and new pressures and emergencies that might arise. <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> turn now to Division No. 655 - Other </para>

          <para class="block">Administrations - Recoverable Expenditure. Under sub-division 1, item 01 in respect of the United States of America this year an amount of just over $lm is sought, less a certain amount to be recovered, making a total for Division No. 655 of $254,000. This compares with a credit last year of $257,000, which is very close to the amount of $254,000. I am interested in some of the detail in this factor. At the Minister&#39;s convenience I should appreciate some explanation of what is involved in this expenditure for which some amount is recovered. My prime interest at this stage is in relation to defence aid for Malaysia and Singapore and the reasons for the decline in the amount. </para>

            <para>- Once again I refer to Division No. 645 and hark back to the recruiting campaign. The Minister will recall that when I first spoke on this subject 1 directed his attention to the item relating to community survey for which the expenditure last year was $7,000 but for which there is no appropriation this year. I am interested to know whether that community survey was concerned with the effectiveness or otherwise of the general recruiting campaign which has been conducted by the Department over the years. I pointed out to the Minister that compared with the cost of surveys which are conducted by private organisations an expenditure of $7,000 for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of the recruiting campaign would be a mere drop in the bucket. But having heard what the Minister said about recruiting generally it occurred to me that the Government and the Department seem to be treating this item as merely a necessary evil instead of trying in some effective way to conduct a planned recruiting campaign or one which is an improvement on the present campaign. I have reached this conclusion as a result of information supplied to me this evening by the Minister in addition to other information which appears in the Estimates. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> said about the amount of expenditure on recruiting activities having been static over the years is quite true. As far back as 1964 the total amount spent on recruiting campaigns in one financial year was $1,296,000. according to an answer supplied to me in November 1964. In other words, 3 years ago the allocation was exactly the same as it is today, despite cost increases and the extension of communication services, particularly television. I am rather surprised that the Department has been unable to supply a breakdown of the expenditure involved in recruiting activities so that we could know how much has been spent on advertising in the Press, on radio and on television. I should have thought that in compiling the Estimates for this financial year an estimate would have been made of the amount that would have been spent on newspaper advertising, the amount that would have been spent on broadcasting and the amount that would have been spent on television. I would have expected information to be available so that we could know whether the expenditure was in capital cities or in country areas. </para>
          <para>In November 1964 the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beaton)</inline> directed  a  question to the Minister or Defence on this subject. At that time in an answer to the honourable member the Minister for Defence supplied details of expenditure on advertising in the Press and on radio and television for all branches of the armed Services, separate amounts being shown for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. I should have thought that if the information was available then it should be available now. After supplying that information in November 1964 the Minister went on to say that it was not possible at that stage to give precise figures so far as country stations were concerned but that arrangements had been made to advertise on country television stations in the following year. That would have been in 1965. He went on to say that in other respects expenditure would broadly follow the general pattern of the previous year. Bearing in mind the great expansion of television services that has occurred throughout Australia in the last 4 years I should have thought that the expenditure involved would have been much greater and the techniques used  would have been quite different. </para>
          <para>The Minister has told us that an advertising council has been formed, that the council is composed of representatives of advertising firms who give advice to the Services on the layout of advertisements to be used. But I wonder whether any advice is given as to the newspapers in which the advertisements are to be inserted, the radio stations over which they will be broadcast and the television stations on which the tele-recordings will appear. Surely one of the first things that any person involved in advertising would try to assess would be a measurement of prospective readers and audiences. Advertising companies spend probably millions of dollars on surveys of this nature. Commercial television stations pay out great sums of money for the McNair and Anderson surveys which are conducted from time to time. Bearing in mind the importance of recruiting today I am rather surprised that the Department has no experts of its own rather than rely on outside people for this advice. As I have said, I cannot help thinking that the Government adopts an attitude of this kind towards this expenditure: I suppose we have to spend some money on advertising for recruits; otherwise we might be accused of not wanting them. </para>
          <para>It is rather significant that the expenditure on advertising in the last financial year was only $291 less than the amount appropriated. Perhaps I am wrong, but it seems to mc that expenditure reached the amount appropriated at a certain point during the year and the Department then said : &#39;We now have to cut out advertising because the vote for this item has practically run out.&#39; I suggest that the Department must look closely at this matter and consider whether a planned and more effective technique can be brought into the recruiting campaign to achieve better results in the interests of this country&#39;s defence. </para>

            <para>- I propose to refer to two or three matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> mentioned Division No. 652 which relates to defence aid for Malaysia and Singapore. The expenditure proposed for this year is less than the expenditure incurred last year. The honourable senator will recall that a 3-year programme was agreed to in which S25m was to be made available for defence aid for Malaysia and Singapore. The vote of S6m this years is the balance of that $25m. The Government announced a few days ago a new programme of aid over the next 3 years which will involve an expenditure of $16m for Malaysia and $4m for Singapore. However, the expenditure on that new programme will not begin until next financial year. The exact requirements of that programme are now being discussed with the authorities in Malaysia and Singapore. Before I come to the other matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> in relation to Division No. 655 which refers to other administrations, recoverable expenditure, T should like to deal with division No. 645, sub-division 2, item 05, Community Survey&#39; which was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland.</inline> The honourable senator asked why no amount is provided this year for this item. </para>

The item provides for expenditure on a pre-payment basis on transactions on behalf of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is a civilian agency of the United States Department of Defense. The transactions involved are for services performed by Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities in connection with the construction and operation of the Joint United StatesAustralian Defence Based Research Facility at Alice Springs. Provision has been made for freight and handling charges, vehicle hire expenses, Postmaster-General&#39;s services, road construction and rental of accommodation. That is the expenditure. We expect the estimated receipts from the United States to be based on planned transactions under sub-division 1 less a credit of $257,046 standing in the United States account at 1st July 1967. </para>

              <para>- I do not care whether or not they are the old rates. In view of the increase in the recruiting cam- paign I am wondering whether the amount provided is sufficient to meet the demand. I intended to ask a question about Division No. 655, but the Minister has just answered a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> in relation to that matter. I understand that the proposed provision refers to the Advanced Research Projects Agency in Alice Springs. My final query relates to Division No. 661 - Buildings. Works, Fittings and Furniture. Expenditure in 1966-67 was $904,000 and this year the proposed appropriation is approximately $Hm. 1 would like some indication as to the basts upon which this work is to be carried out. Is it to be done by tender, on a day labour basis or on some other basis? </para>

            <para>I refer to Division No. 640 - Administrative. I should like the Minister to tell me, if possible, how far the review concerning the unification of the three Services has gone. Even before I entered the Federal Parliament 1 said that it was time we abolished the three Services as such and combined them. I know that this would horrify the civil servants. At the present time there are 14,000 civil servants catering for the needs of approximately 83,000 members of the permanent forces. It must be very gratifying to the personnel of the permanent forces to know that for every six of them there is one civil servant behind them looking after their needs. Australia cannot afford this. If other countries can do with one department administering the three Services, so can Australia. To me it is quite absurd that in a small country such as Australia we should have the head of the Department of Defence receiving $17,500 per annum and the heads of three other defence departments receiving $15,000 per annum, together with hosts of Deputy Secretaries and First Assistant Secretaries. I think I quickly counted 20 highly paid officers in the Department of Defence and 23 in the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Army and the Department of Air. Most of them could be eliminated with the unification of the three Services. Later on, when dealing with a different Division, 1 shall mention that the medical services should be combined. Apart from the savings that would ensure, at least we would get rid of three Ministers. </para>

            <para>-  In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull,</inline> I can only say that I do not know of any review which is going on. I may be misinformed. I may not have all the information that I should have. I do not know of a review which  is  directed, as a matter of policy, to the unification of the three Services. I am bound to say that I think it would be a very retrograde step if the three Services were to be combined; I do not believe that the arrangement would work well at all. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> on one point. There are elements of the Services which I think could well be unified; the medical services appear to me to be a case in point. It  is  a matter of judgment and of debate. I do not believe that it would result in considerable savings in the number of public servants employed. 1 do not believe that the Parliament would be as well served if it had one Minister trying to answer questions for all four departments. I do not believe that the Services themselves would be as efficient or effective. But there is a great volume of opinion on the other side. However, this is not a matter in &#34;relation to which we are at present seeking an appropriation. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman,</inline> I should like to ask about a number of items of proposed expenditure. I refer to the provision for a proportion of the salaries of staff of the Commonwealth Loans Organisation under Division No. 645  -  Recruiting Campaign. The sum of $46,500 is being appropriated. I cannot fathom how this expenditure is related to the recruiting campaign, and I hope that the Minister will enlighten me. I refer also to incidental&#39; and other expenditure under Division No. 640  -  Administrative, for which $67,700 is being appropriated. Under the heading of incidental and other expenditure relating to the recruiting campaign, in Division No. 645, there is an appropriation for $19,200. Whenever I have had to give a summary of income and expenditure, I have always been very careful not to use this kind of description. I believe that it is not good practice to do so, and auditors generally insist that it should not be adopted. These two sums together make a total of $86,900. That is a fairly large amount. The details of the expenditure of these sums are more or less hidden, though perhaps not intentionally. I am not charging anybody with trying to hide the details, but there must be some explanation of the manner in which the money is to be spent, and I ask the Minister to give me an explanation. </para>

Under the heading &#39;Executive&#39;, the amounts are as follows: Rail, air and road transport freight costs, $16,500; entertainment expenses and miscellaneous expenditure for defence representatives overseas and for the  Chairman  of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, $2,000; advertising, petty cash payments and miscellaneous, $8,000; medical expenses and compensation for staff injured on duty, $2,000; incidental expenditure at the Exmouth naval communication station and at Alice Springs, $2,500; industrial mobilisation courses, $2,000. The total under this heading is $33,000. For electronic data processing, there are the following sums: Medical expenses and compensation for staff injured on duty, $2,000; freight and cartage, $2,500; advertising and miscellaneous expenditure, $500. This gives a total of $5,000 under this heading. The advertising mentioned is specifically for civilian staff requirements, not for Service requirements. </para>

          <para>For the Joint Intelligence Division, provision is made as follows: Cost of replacement and return of officers located overseas, $2,000; advertising for staff $1,200; petty cash payments, tuition fees and miscellaneous, $2,500. This adds up to $5,700 for the Joint Intelligence Division. For the Defence Signals Division, the following provision is made: Freight and cartage, $11,500; furniture, fittings and services at overseas posts, $8,000; advertising, petty cash payments, training, destruction of waste and miscellaneous, $4,500. The total for the Defence Signals Division comes to $24,000. These in total make up the sum of $67,700 which is being appropriated. There are several instances of miscellaneous expenditure, which I think would come down to sums of $50, $35 and the like.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ORMONDE</inline>(New South Wales) (10.37&#93;  -  There has been some mention of the recruiting campaign this evening, and I am concerned to see that we get value for the money .that we spend on advertising in this campaign. I ask the Minister whether anything has been done to obviate the obvious waste of money and effort in calling for volunteers for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force and then rejecting a large proportion of them. One report that I read stated that one in every two applicants ls rejected for educational reasons. The inquiries that I have made lead me to believe that that assessment is correct. This high rejection rate represents a good deal of wasted effort and money, merely because of educational deficiencies. Has the Government considered establishing some educational service that can improve the educational standards of volunteers and thereby enable them to be recruited to the Services after they have attained the required educational standards? I believe that the standards set are not especially high and that some of the rejections are due to quite elementary deficiencies. In World War II, the Army had an educational service under which the recruiting section conducted training schools that helped to make up the leeway. Is there any such organisation at present to make it possible to recruit volunteers who would otherwise be rejected because they cannot cope with arithmetic or perhaps English at elementary levels? I have heard it said in this chamber that the modern soldier needs higher educational qualifications than those that were required of soldiers during the last war. Is anything being done in that regard and has it been possible to rescue - if I might use the word - any of the applicants who want to join the Army but have not the necessary educational qualifications? </para>

It relates to item 02 of subdivision 1 of Division No. 645. He asked what was the significance of the provision for proportion of the salaries of staff of the Commonwealth Loans Organisation and what these personnel had to do with the defence Services. This item provides for a percentage of the salaries of persons assisting part time in the recruiting campaign. The Commonwealth Directors of Loans are the State  Deputy  Directors of Recruiting. They are able to devote part of their time to recruiting and they have a big network of agents throughout the States who distribute recruiting posters and so on for us. The Commonwealth Loans Organisation is used to avoid duplicating this network. The increase this year arises from increases resulting from salary determinations and the filling of positions that were vacant for part of last year. </para>

This amount is required to meet expenses in relation to removal to the new recruiting centre in Melbourne, which is expected to be open in November this year, and to provide advertising display fittings for offices of honorary recruiting secretaries. The breakdown of the expenditure by States is: Victoria and Tasmania, $5,850; New South Wales, $2,200; Queensland, $3,708; South Australia, $4,596; Western Australia, $2,846. This expenditure relates to the upkeep of the State recruiting centres and covers such items as office requisites, office services, and expense of removal to the new recruiting centre in Melbourne, of which I have already spoken. </para>

              <para>asked whether the Army had any method of educating to the pretty low standard required an applicant who did not meet that standard. There is no provision for that to be done. I understand that aptitude tests are applied to persons seeking to join the Army. Subject to the disabilities that all tests have, if those aptitude tests show that a person is likely to absorb Service training and do well in the Service the educational standards are dropped even lower than they would otherwise be. No school is conducted by any of the Services for educating recruits who do not meet the educational standards, though the Services do conduct apprentice training schools and the Navy conducts an academic school at Leeuwin. </para>

            <para>- Yes. The Minister would probably have the figures at hand. Many thousands of young people have been rejected and he might make these figures available. I know that in industry, particularly in my own State, when the question of setting high standard entry examinations for apprenticeships is raised most organised employers take the view that a young fellow should be considered on his general experience and that many young people who make the best tradesmen and apprentices are slow starters. In my experience the employers usually reject the unions&#39; argument that the Leaving standard might be applied to very technical trades. I put it to the Minister that there is room, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> suggests, for a group to be taken into the Services and trained. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My second point is that I understand that there are frequent consultations between defence Service officers and industrial groups at which such matters as employment, classifications and techniques in industry are discussed. Has the matter of recruiting been the subject of consultation with people in industry? If it has not, will the Minister consider this form of consultation as a worth while method of increasing the number of young people who join the Services? I am sure that greater numbers of volunteers could be induced to join the Army. Quite a number of fathers have brought to my attention young people who were rejected because of their educational standards. I know that these young people were dedicated to joining the Services. It seems to me that it would be no great hardship to the defence Services to organise some sort of reception group by means of which these young people could be recruited, educated, trained, and fitted into various musterings and classifications. </para>
          <para>I should like to refer to another question but I am not quite sure whether it comes under the items that we are now considering. I cannot find in the estimates foi the Department of the Army a section in relation to medical fees and travelling costs. I am concerned about the case of a South Australian railway stationmaster who lost two days pay by going to have a medical examination for the Citizen Military Forces. Upon applying for recovery of payment for the time lost and travelling expenses he was refused both by the Army and by the South Australian Railways, which seems to me to be a very bad decision. If this matter does not come under the Department of Defence T shall raise it when we are considering the estimates for the Department of the Army. </para>

            <para>- First I shall endeavour to elucidate the last point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> in relation to travelling to take a medical examination for the Citizen Military Forces. I understand that this expenditure would come out of the Department of Defence vote rather than the Department of the Army vote. It is the practice to pay for the overnight accommodation and meals of somebody travelling to take a medical examination for the CMF but not for his time away from work. I shall bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairhall).</inline> It is clearly a matter of policy and I am glad that the honourable senator raised it. </para>

          <para>Two other matters raised are not directly related to a particular appropriation in the Estimates. I do not believe that discussions which take place between outside industriesand the defence forces are concerned with the education of people who apply to join the Services but are found to fall below the educational standard. The standard required is much lower than the Leaving standard. The discussions have been more concerned with industrial mobilisation of machinery and manpower, and that type of subject. </para>
          <para>It is not easy for young men to become apprentices in any of the Services and to gain entry to the Navy&#39;s Nirimba college, the college run by the Army, or the college, at Wagga run by the Air Force. Very good opportunities are provided in these colleges and there is always a very long waiting list of people who want to enter them. The training given is very good indeed. I think the unions regard it as very good and have no hesitation whatever in accepting the output of the colleges. The conditions under which the apprentices live are rather remunerative. Lads of 16, 17 or 18 years may have to live for a couple of years in the types of huts that servicemen lived in during World War II, but that certainly does not do them any harm. They certainly find conditions agreeable, because there are long waiting lists. A little choosiness can be exercised in selecting people for apprenticeship training given by the Services. </para>
          <para>Reference has been made to whether the Services should accept people who fall well below the educational requirements. I have pointed out that an aptitude test is given. If an applicant is found likely to be satisfactory, the educational requirement is not strictly applied. Whether applicants who fall well below the requirement should be accepted and educated to the required standard is a matter of judgment and policy. It is a matter of balancing the enthusiasm of people who are dedicated to entering the Services and who really want to do nothing else against the great amount of public money involved in educating them to the required standard.I can only bring the suggestion to the attention of the Minister for Defence. </para>

Aerial ignition under suitable circumstances would extend the scope of this. Prescribed burning is unacceptable in certain areas for a variety of reasons.

      <para class="block">Recently the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> assumed the title of  Chairman  of the Australian Forestry Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> and I attended the conference held in Canberra on bush fire prevention. It will be seen from the list of resolutions carried at the conference that considerable attention was paid to the use of aircraft in bush fire prevention, not only for conventional purposes, but also for spotting and many kindred purposes. I raised this subject during the debate on legislation covering softwood plantings as well as the debate on the estimates of the CSIRO. Reports on the use of aircraft in fire fighting have appeared in the Press but the details given have been rather sketchy. </para>
      <para>I ask the Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Henty),</inline> who represents the Minister for National Development in this chamber, to inform the Senate of the results of visits to North America by some of our forestry experts to procure certain aircraft. I refer to the Canadian aircraft for use as water bombers, for the dropping of chemical bombs or for other purposes. Members of the Opposition think that the Department of National Development should step up considerably the use of aircraft in fire fighting. We go further than that, as will be seen from the list of resolutions I have incorporated in Hansard-. We believe that the Commonwealth should create a national fire fighting squad. Since this matter was raised I have obtained from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> details of the amounts expended over the last 10 years on bush fire relief. It amounts to many millions of dollars. I think that at present the Government is budgeting for the expenditure of about $8m more as a result of the terrible Tasmanian bush fires. </para>
      <para>I would like to get from the Minister in reply to my suggestion about a national fire fighting force more than a comment on what it would cost. If the cost of such a squad - it would be fairly large - is offset against the cost of bush fire relief, it is obvious that there is a reasonable financial margin. Greater use could- be made of more modern detection methods to supplement the activities undertaken at State level. </para>
      <para>I refer now to Division No. 345 - Bureau of Mineral Resources. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> will recall that recently I pointed out to him very forcibly that it seems fruitless that top flight officers in the Bureau should point out to the States the locations of deposits of limestone and other minerals while the States adopt an offhanded attitude and do not act on the suggestions made to them. I would like an assurance from the Minister that when research and surveys are undertaken by the Commonwealth, the Minister for National Development or his officers will confer with the State Ministers for Mines. Recently in  a  debate on the adjournment of the Senate I referred to tremendous agitation at the failure of the New South Wales Minister for Mines to make a definite decision on whether to give some combines approval to ravish the Blue Mountains area of New South Wales. The Department of National Development could furnish first class advice as to alternative sites for the operations of the combines. I do urge the Minister to do what he can to ensure that rather than pander to the cement combines the States will accept the advice of the Bureau of Mineral Resources based on surveys. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> agrees with me on this matter, for he knows that at one stage there was talk of disregarding section 92 of the Constitution. </para>
      <para>I come now to Division 342, and remind the Senate of my previous argument with relation to attaching to the Department of National Development those divisions of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation which deal with bush fires and the preservation of wild life. For 3 years now I have been advocating that the CSIRO Division of Wildlife Research should be attached to the Department of National Development to work in conjunction with the development of mineral resources and forest areas. While I appreciate that the Minister might have some doubts about constitutional difficulties, I do not think it is impossible to arrange for the establishment of a small secretariat to avoid some of the conflict that occurs when we are told that in the interests of progress some of the natural habitats of our wild life have to be sacrificed. I believe that a planned partnership could overcome these problems. 1 come now to the Division of National Mapping. 1 should like to know whether this Division undertakes aerial surveys and, if so, whether charter aircraft are used for the purpose. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has referred to the Australian Forestry Council and the work done by its fire fighting seclion. The Australian Forestry Council is comprised of the Minister for National Development and the various State Ministers charged with the responsibility for forests. As the honourable senator has stated, our forestry fire expert has just returned from a visit to the United States of America and Canada where he witnessed demonstrations by water bomber aircraft. He reports that most of the aircraft being used on this work at the moment are former World War II aircraft which are now nearing the end of their serviceable life and that new types of aircraft are being developed. This is an important matter and the effectiveness of the new types of aircraft being developed overseas is being kept under close scrutiny. That is as far as we have gone in this work up to date. </para>

        <para>The honourable senator also referred to the Wildlife Research Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.

            <para>- That is so, but I am doubtful about the wisdom of transferring the Wildlife Research Division to the Department of National Development although I do appreciate that the preservation of wild life is an important matter. I have listened to the honourable senator&#39;s advocacy in this chamber over some years now and I know his interest in the preservation of our wild life. I share that interest fully with him, but I feel that this matter is better left with the CSIRO. I appreciate his point that when we are carrying out developmental works either in our mineral areas or in our forests we should keep in mind the necessity and practicability, of taking steps to preserve our wild life. In the United Kingdom for instance, wild life is sometimes transferred to other areas. I appreciate that, through neglect in former years, some forms of our wild life have become extinct. This is a very interesting matter, but I believe that the preservation of wild life should be left in the hands of the CSIRO. </para>

        <para>The honourable senator also asked whether the Division of National Mapping charters aircraft. It does. It is proposed that new contracts shall be let during 1967-68 for a number of operations. These include helicopter charter in the Northern Territory for the 1967 season for ground station marking in desert areas for Aerodist surveys. The amount set aside for this work is $36,000. Another operation is helicopter charter in the Northern Territory during the 1963 season for ground station marking and for the transport of remote station crews to otherwise inaccessible areas during Aerodist surveys. The sum provided is $72,000. The sum of $16,000 is being provided for the hire of twin-engined fixed-wing aircraft for laser airborne profile recording operations. During 1966-67, the Weapons Research Establishment commenced the development of an airborne profile recorder activated by a laser beam. This development will continue during 1967-68 and present indications are that an operational model will be ready for use in April or May 1968. The sum of $10,000 is provided for the hire of light aircraft for spot photography. It is proposed to expend $3,500 on the hire of light aircraft for second order traverse reconnaissance in Western Australia and $13,500 on the hire of a helicopter in Western Australia for second order traverse during August and September 1967. The total amount involved in these programmes is $151,000. </para>

          <para>- I refer to Division No. 932 - Department of National Development - Capital Works and Services. The appropriation for 1967-68 for this Department is some $3.3m less than expenditure last year. I should have thought that national development would have been the most important thing in Australia today having regard to the situation in which Australia finds itself, particularly in relation to drought. There is also a reduction of $2.5m in the allocation to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. The total reduction probably amounts to more than that because at the foot of page 11 of Appropriation Bill (No. 2) is a note which reads: &#39;In addition $4,449,797 charged to Loan Fund&#39;. </para>

        <para>The whole world is becoming very interested in the development of atomic energy. A considerable sum of money is being spent in America on what is known as the Plowshare scheme, and there is a degree of agitation in Australia for atomic energy to be used on water conservation projects and the development of harbours. I should have thought that this Government would have been anxious to develop atomic energy in Australia. The comparatively small expenditure of $1,629,000 last year under the Atomic Energy Act has been reduced by $300,000 this year, at a time when there is talk that within the next decade there will be atomic energy in Victoria and a requirement for atomic energy in South Australia. In addition, if we are to develop the minerals in the north of Western Australia to the processing stage it is quite likely that we will require atomic energy in that area. Yet expenditure has been cut to the extent of $300,000. </para>
        <para>It is not my purpose at this stage to argue the merits of the Chowilla Dam which happens to be one of the tragedies of this Government&#39;s bad planning in relation to State water supplies. Proposed expenditure under the River Murray Waters Act has been reduced from $645,000 last year to $315,000 this year. I do not know whether the Government is trying to recover on the side part of the $5m which has been spent on the Chowilla Dam. Although water is the most precious commodity that we have in Australia we find this considerable reduction in proposed expenditure. The conservation of water is the most important subject that should be exercising the mind of any responsible Commonwealth government because today we have three States - South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales - experiencing a severe drought. National development, particularly in the field of water conservation, is something in which the Government should be taking a much keener interest. If it took as much interest in water conservation as it does in maintaining good relations with the United States we might be able to develop this country. </para>

If we could do that there perhaps would not be the rush for nationalisation that we see in so many countries.

        <para>In the first place, expenditure on plant and equipment in the Department of National Development is being reduced by $100,000. Secondly, proposed expenditure under the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act is being reduced by $2.5m. I appreciate that the Authority is in the winding up stage and that in the next 5 years it will cease to exist. The brains that we have been able to gather together over the years to perform one of the major engineering projects in the world - something of which Australia is proud - will be spread probably throughout the world, cer tainly throughout Australia. But even though the scheme is drawing to a close there is plenty of work upon which the specialists we have gathered together in the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority could be engaged. The Minister may say that the $2.5m reduction is the result of a slackening off in work on the scheme but that is not sufficient to satisfy the people of Australia. There should be an ever-expanding process of employment of these specialists on other projects. </para>
        <para>Thirdly, the people of Australia, and indeed this Parliament, are entitled to know why expenditure under the Atomic Energy Act is being reduced by some $300,000 particularly in these days of vital development in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Finally, I am sure that the Premier and the people of South Australia would be very interested to know why expenditure under the River Murray Waters Act is also being reduced by $300,000. </para>

I am advised that this matter was not studied specifically by our representative who was overseas and has returned only in the last few days but we will pursue our inquiries to see whether he has any information on it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> referred to the proposed expenditure of $41,582,000 by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority in 1967-68. That is the amount required to enable the Authority to carry out its programme of work in that year. As he said, the work is now tapering off and it is only to be expected that smaller sums of money will be required. He referred also to the Chowilla Dam. I take him up on that. This has nothing to do with the Commonwealth Government. The planning was done by the South Australian authorities. The River Murray Commission comprises representatives of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and the Commonwealth Minister for National Development acts as  Chairman.  The project is under review at the moment. Its development is in abeyance whilst further investigations of it are being made. We debated this matter in this chamber only quite recently.

            <para>- I am advised that it is not under a special Act. The Commonwealth meets one-quarter of the cost. The rest is met by the States of Victoria. New South Wales and South Australia. It is quite wrong for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> to say that this deferment is the result of Commonwealth Government bungling. It is nothing of the sort. At the request of the States, the Commonwealth Government is meeting onequarter of the cost. The River Murray Commission handed over to the South Australian authorities responsibility lor the completion of the plans and specifications for this dam. That work was done by the South Australian authorities, who made an estimate of about $28m, if my memory serves me correctly. Later they amended the estimate to $43m. Then, on the basis of the work done by the South Australian Authorities, tenders were called and they showed a cost of about $70m. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The project is now being reviewed by the River Murray Commission, an independent authority on which New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria are represented and on which the Commonwealth has a representative because it has accepted responsibility for meeting one-quarter of the cost. So 1 must take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> up on this matter and say that he is quite wrong when he says that this deferment is the result of bungling by the Commonwealth Government. It is nothing of the sort. For various reasons an attempt has been made to saddle the Federal Government with the blame for this deferment, but the project has nothing to do with the Federal Government, except that it meets, one-quarter of the cost. </para>
        <para>I believe that out of the review that the River Murray Commission is now undertaking will come a far more satisfactory solution for South Australia and the people who will use this water. The area required may be a little less than was thought at first, as a result of the investigations that are now taking place. I do not pose as an authority on this project, but because it was mentioned in this chamber - and because I am interested in this type of work </para>
        <para class="block">I have read a good deal about it. I believe that out of this review will come a scheme that will be more acceptable than the present one which, at a cost of about $70m, docs not seem to be as satisfactory as it should be. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline>referred to a reduction in the capital works and services appropriation for the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. The reduction is due to a decrease in construction expenditure in 1967-68 because of the completion of some major projects. That decrease is partly offset by an increased provision for scientific plant and equipment. In other words, the construction of some buildings has been completed and the Commission is now purchasing plant and equipment to go into those buildings. This is part of the planned construction programme. </para>
        <para>An examination of the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> raised in relation to the Atomic Energy Commission leads me to say that in the next 10 years there will be great development in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes including power. I think that is accepted by all authorities. When the Commonwealth was considering making money available to the Tasmanian Government for the Gordon River scheme - $48m was made available in the form of bridging finance - I asked the Department of National Development to investigate that scheme vis a vis the use of atomic energy by the time it was finished. I am indebted to the officers of the Department. They gave me an excellent report to the effect that it would appear that it will be 10 years before atomic plants become economically competitive in the production of electricity. They considered that the Gordon River scheme would be of great economic benefit to Tasmania. But atomic plants are undoubtedly coming. They will be of great benefit in outlying areas of Australia. In America at the present time smaller plants are being developed. They could be situated in various parts of the Australian outback and could give a considerable boost to development. </para>
        <para>I would not like anyone to think that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission is not keeping closely in touch with the developments in this field. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> wants any advice on this matter, I would strongly advise him to put his problems to the Commission. He will receive the same help as I received in trying to assess whether the Commonwealth should provide bridging finance to the extent of $48m to the Tasmanian Government and the HydroElectric Commission and whether the Commonwealth should use the money of the Australian taxpayers in that way without first knowing the economics of the great Gordon River scheme and whether atomic energy could compete or more than compete with hydro-electric power in the years that lie ahead. The departmental officers satisfied me on that question. I am greatly indebted to them for what they did. 1 am sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> wanted any further information on this matter the departmental officers would make it available to him. I think I have covered fairly well all the matters that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> raised. If I have missed any, I would like him to tell me now so that I can do what I can to answer any questions that I have omitted to answer. </para>

              <para>- Nobody knows whether the projected schedule will be followed tomorrow. I am informed that due to an error on the part of the people who went to the United States to purchase the Charles F. Adams destroyers, when certain furnace repairs are being done in Australia on these destroyers, the American fire brick is not available. Instead of the numbered fire brick being available, considerable improvisation is necessary. 1 do not belittle the efforts of our artificers or ordnance staff. It is obvious that the people whom we sent overseas to shop for this sophisticated defence equipment committed a grave error in not ensuring that the United States manufactured fire brick <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> available in Australia. What assurance have we that this oversight will be rectified? The Navy is not on a war footing but this oversight in not providing the correct fire bricks is not a good advertisement for the procurement methods employed by the Navy. I do not doubt the ability of our craftsmen to improvise but I do not think this should be necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and I know something about the use of fire bricks in locomotive fire boxes. We know that the wrong brick can lead to a lot of difficulty. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> paid me the courtesy of informing me that he intended to raise this matter. I was able to get some information for him. Fire bricks fitted to the Royal Australian Navy guided missile destroyers are, naturally, made to United States Navy specifications. To ensure serviceability to the guided missile destroyers an initial supply of spares was obtained from the United States. However, the United States Navy specifications for the guided missile destroyer fire brick requirements have been obtained and following satisfactory manufacture of fire bricks, future requirements will be obtained locally. </para>
