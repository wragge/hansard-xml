                        <para>- My question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development relates to the temporary curtailment of work on the Chowilla Dam project near Renmark in South Australia. As there is much concern in South Australia at the action of the River Murray Commission in recommending this course, will the Minister let me know the reason for the hold up, seeing thai the Minister for National Development is  Chairman  of the Commission, and state when and under what circumstances the work is likely to proceed? </para>

                        <para>-  The situation to which the honourable senator refers is under constant review by the Government. If he looks at the Government's record in the provision of assistance to the aged and to pensioners generally, he will see that it is indeed a good record. The honourable senator suggests that some inquiry be made. A number of inquiries have been made by qualified individuals. I have read some of the reports with great interest. I should like to give some consideration to the suggestion and to put it before the Government. </para>

                        <para>-  Yes, I am aware of statements which have been made by political parties in Victoria to this effect. Whether the Victorian Police Force, is being seriously handicapped as a result1 of the call up of forty-nine persons who are at present undergoing national service is a matter for individual judgment. Whether or not the call up of those mcn constitutes a serious handicap is open to question. It appears to me that no better case can be advanced for exempting police from call up than for exempting other categories of people in the community who readily spring to mind and who also have important duties to perform. I remind the honourable send tor that it is within the province of any .member of the Victorian Police Force to exempt himself from being called up by 'enlisting with the Citizen Military Forces. The fact that so many policemen have not chosen to do that indicates quite clearly that they are prepared to take the same stand as all the other people of their age throughout Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honourable senator asks me a very long and complicated question. I answer it along the following lines: I do not think that we would have had an export iron ore industry if its establishment had been left to a government. I do not think that we would have been able, in competition with other countries, to secure the export orders for iron ore that we have obtained with an industry conducted by private enterprise. I was wondering why the Leader of the Opposition became so touchy about his Party's platform. I always understood that the platform of his Party which he was required to follow provided for the nationalisation of industry, distribution and exchange. Correct me if I am wrong, but T understand that this is part and parcel of that platform. 1 do not see why the Leader is so touchy about this position. I know full well that at the present time an effort is being made to damp it down a bit so that it is not put before the people of Australia but I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that we shall bring this matter to the attention of the people of Australia however much the Australian Labor Party tries to damp it down. We shall bring the matter to the attention of the people of Australia at every opportunity because the people must be asked to judge a party on its policy and on its platform. It is futile for the Leader of the Opposition to be a bit touchy about it, because we shall disclose it to the people of Australia with the results that we have had at every election in the last eighteen years. </para>

But I would point out to him one fact which we should all appreciate: This is not a problem peculiar to Mascot or Tullamarine, or even to Australia; it is a phenomenon occurring throughout the world as a result of the type of aircraft being used. I am certain that studies of it are being made. I will be happy to get whatever information I can from the Minister for the honourable senator and for the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- The honourable senator seems to have got his figures a little mixed. He spoke about an increase of 9% in the gross national product. If I remember correctly, the Budget Speech stated that in real terms the increase was 5%. As I have told the honourable senator on previous occasions, all aspects of social services are given full consideration when the Budget is being framed with a view to giving all the assistance we possibly can. It is the Government's duty, after considering all these matters thoroughly, to place them in some order of priority. We receive representations from a wide range of organisations connected with social services. All these representations are given the most careful consideration with a view to determining whether the various requests may be granted. This year's Budget does give relief in certain quarters. The reasons for that relief are clearly set out in the Treasurer's Budget Speech. </para>

I ask the Minister whether I am correct in understanding that the corresponding benefit for a widow in similar circumstances will be an additional pension over and above the present Repatriation pension of about five-eighths of the pension payable to an incapacitated husband. </para>

The information I have is that in the age group of twenty-one, a private infantry man given a normal expectancy of life would receive from the Defence Forces Retirements Benefits Fund $29,000 together with a Repatriation and war service payment of $44,000, making a total of $73,000. </para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Has the Australian Government any observers in South Vietnam to study and report on next month's presidential election? Has the Government taken any steps to verify the serious allegations, made by the civilian presidential candidates and others, of widespread fraud and malpractice in the interests of the military team of Thieu and Ky? As Australia is one of the few countries with armed forces in Vietnam, what assurance can the Government give the Senate that this election will provide a free and genuine expression of the choice of the people of South Vietnam? </para>

                            <para>- The eleven or so candidates are engaged in campaigning throughout Vietnam. They are having their statements produced in the Vietnamese Press. I can find those statements for the honourable senator. The statements are critical of the present Government, as would be statements by people campaigning for an Opposition here in Australia. There seems to be no indication of these people not being able to appear on television, not being able to make statements in support of their candidature and not being able to take a full part in the campaign. That is about all I can say. </para>

Is it not a fact that' several intending candidates in the election were prevented from standing? Is it not a fact that  President  Johnson indicated that a rigged election would cost South Vietnam the support of the American people? Has any similar warning been given by the Australian Government, or is it intended to use Australian troops to bolster up any kind of regime in South Vietnam regardless of any denial of the will of the people and democratic processes? </para>

                                <para>- The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, as to whether  President  Johnson said that if something happened it would be bad, has nothing whatever to do with what is happening. The information that we have from our posts in Vietnam is that there are 11 presidential candidates and 480 other candidates; that they are campaigning throughout Vietnam; that they are appearing on television; that the Press is operating freely; and that all candidates have made television and radio appearances. It is up to those people who claim, or by innuendo seek to suggest, that there is something wrong in Vietnam at the present time to show that the candidates have not been appearing on television, and that in fact their campaigns, criticisms of the Government and suggestions as to why they should be elected are not appearing freely in the newspapers. If they are appearing freely, then let us have a little less of this denigration in advance of an election campaign which in itself must be almost unique. It is taking place in a country in which war is going on. The candidates for election are being threatened and murdered by the Vietcong, yet the people are carrying out an election campaign to elect a government. </para>

I had received from the Attorney-General replies which in my opinion were unsatisfactory to the various questions I had asked. On 18th April last I asked you. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, whether</inline> it was not your view that if the telephones of senators - in particular those telephones within Parliament House or in the Commonwealth offices - were being tapped by any person or organisation it was a breach of the privileges and rights of senators.

It does not seem to me to be proper or in the interests of any section of the Australian community to cast doubts and criticisms, as the honourable senator did, on an arbitrator - an umpire - who is appointed to make decisions on these matters. </para>

                        <para>- By sailing round the Cape of Good Hope the lines concerned would, of course, avoid paying Suez dues but against this saving must be reckoned the higher cost of obtaining bunker oil in Capetown, the extra time involved in sailing round the Cape and the extra time taken for vessels serving Mediterranean ports to deviate into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic. I am advised that on balance there are additional costs associated with the Cape route as compared with the Suez route. The extent of those costs will be influenced by the extent to which the price of bunker oil in Capetown rises and the extent to which delays occur in Capetown resulting from port congestion. Such factors cannot be estimated in advance. </para>

Will the Minister further agree that with Australia's growing population there is now a shortage of trained teachers in this country and that we can ill afford to lose to overseas nations people who have been trained in Australia for such an essential calling?

                        <para>- I have seen the Press reports to which the honourable senator has referred. I was under the impression that the teachers who were taking up teaching positions in Canada came, for the most part, from Victoria but they may be coming from other States. In any case, I should . make it clear t.ihi the matter of teachers' conditions has nothing whatever to do with the Commonwealth Government. It is completely under the control of the various State Governments which have differing opinions as to what a teacher should be paid. I think that is one point raised by the honourable senator. If I were forming a complete judgment on this matter I would want to know more along the lines of how many teachers were going to Canada for what could be the very laudable purpose of spending a year or so teaching abroad and obtaining experience which could be useful to their careers. I should also want to know how many were going permanently because they thought conditions there were better than they are here, which would be a different approach, and I should want to know the inflow of teachers into Australia from other countries. If there were a net loss of teachers because those going abroad permanently thought conditions here were bad then that, I admit, would be a loss to Australian education. </para>

                    <para>There are at present insufficient teachers in Australia to bring classes down to what has been declared by the educational conference to be an ideal size. This is one of the reasons why the Commonwealth Government is making available $8m a year in unmatched grants to provide more accommodation to train more teachers and to train them for a longer period than is now the case. The Budget presented yesterday is the first occasion on which such funds have been allocated. </para>

                        <para>- My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate Who represents the Prime Minister - the head of the Government and the leader in control of the Minister for Air - relates to the secrecy surrounding the cost of maintaining the VIP flight, termed No. 34B Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, and the purposes for which it is used. Does the Minister realise the intolerable position in which honourable senators are placed when they cannot obtain answers to questions on this matter? Does he realise that honourable senators can obtain an answer to practically every question except one relating to this VIP flight? Has the Minister any idea of the security involved in the nature of the flights, the number of them and the cost of these particular nights? </para>

                        <para>- One of the objectives of the Vietcong has been to prevent not only presidential elections but the previous hamlet and local government elections being held. The Vietcong has even gone to the lengths of shooting people on their way to the polling booths, in an endeavour to terrorise the population out of casting a free vote. The presence of Australian troops there is designed amongst other things, to keep that terrorism away from the polling booths. I would like to add, in relation to the conduct of the elections themselves, that the Government of South Vietnam has invited observers from the United Nations and thirty-six other, countries with which it has diplomatic relations to go to Vietnam to observe the elections and the freedom with which they are held. That scarcely seems to be the action of a government which is endeavouring to run a bad election. </para>

                        <para>- I have not those figures in my mind, but I will get them and give them to the honourable senator. The question relates to the numbers enrolled in veterinary science and to action alleged to have been taken by the University of Queensland. A veterinary school was recently established at the University of Melbourne. That school is only reaching the final year of its course this year. Students from South Australia, and I think also from Western Australia, attend that school. If the honourable senator wishes. I shall obtain for her the places at which there are veterinary science faculties, and the numbers of students who are enrolled. </para>

                        <para>- There is not a copy of a report available or even made, which is perfectly natural. All journalists, of course, are free to visit South Vietnam. As I said, the Government of South Vietnam has invited the United Nations -to appoint observers, and it has invited thirty-six other countries to appoint observers. We have in the country our own diplomatic post. Whether the honourable senator thinks that somebody else should be sent as well is another matter. There is again an innuendo  in this question, that facilities might not be made available for these observers properly to see what was happening in the . election campaign. Can anyone believe that a country which asked representatives of the United Nations and representatives of other nations to go there would be so stupid, having invited them to go there and having got them there, as not to give them full facilities to look at the election campaign? </para>

The Committee of Economic Enquiry attempted to measure what it termed the 'subsidy equivalent' of protection to both primary and secondary industries (in paragraph 165 of Appendix L of the Committee's Report). These calculations suggested that the cost of protecting secondary industries was considerably higher than the cost of subsidies and other measures of protection to primary industries. The Committee drew attention to the technical difficulties of measurement and other limitations of the calculations. </para>

                        <para>The question of extending retiring ages for the Services has been considered recently but, on the advice of the Services themselves, it has been concluded that this should not be done. Retiring ages are lower than in civilian life because the demands of service in the armed forces, particularly in the tropics, require a high degree of physical fitness. Operational service is the younger man's task. All servicemen today are liable for overseas service and personnel in all ranks and musterings must be fit and ready for operational deployment at short, notice. This has been demonstrated in recent years by our involvement with little warning in operations in Borneo and South Vietnam. </para>
                        <para>Officers not normally engaged in active lighting operations - e.g. non-seagoing officers in the Navy and non-flying officers in the Air Force - retire at later ages than other officers of the same ranks. For other ranks the retiring age of 55 years is considered to be the upper limit. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer has supplied the following answers: 1 to 4. During the Second World War the Commonwealth, and the State governments, did pay the superannuation contributions of their employees. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">However, the reason for this wasthatpublic servants in the forces were, in most cases,suffering a marked loss of income and it was feltthat such a compulsory and statutory charge as superannuation should therefore be met by the Government. The present position as regards national servicemen is different, and consequently for a number of reasons the Government decided that Commonwealth public servants performing national service should he responsible for their own superannuation contributions. On call-up national servicemen receive adult ratesof pay, together with such loadings, allowances and benefits as to make the margin, if any, between the effective emoluments of the public servant and the national serviceman in this age group not generally significant. Some, no doubt - for example, those who achieve officer status - would receive pay and allowances in the Army greater than their public service salaries. In addition, it should be borne in mind that members of the Regular forces with whom national servicemen are serving are required to meet their own contributions to the defence forces retirement benefits scheme from their Army pay and, clearly,it would 'be undesirable for one member to have his contributions to a superannuation scheme met by the Commonwealth whilst his Regular Army colleague met his from his own resources. </para>
                    <para>I am informed that the Tasmanian Government meets the superannuation contribution of its employees. The position in South Australia is somewhat different in that officers of the South Australian Public Service who are called up for national service are required to maintain their own superannuation contributions while in other than a combat area. However, contributions are met by the State Government as from the date of the officer's embarkation for a combat area - at present this is limited to Vietnam - and closes from the date of disembarkation on his return. </para>

                        <para>The shipbuilding subsidy was designed to assist the Australian shipbuilding industry to meet competition from overseas ship builders and thereby maintain a shipbuilding industry in Australia. It would appear that what the honourable senator has in mind is not assistance for the shipbuilding industry but assistance for the fishing industry by subsidising the building of fishing vessels. It is not certain that an extension of the shipbuilding subsidy would bc the appropriate way to achieve this end. </para>
                        <para>However, the honourable senator will no doubt bc interested to know that the question of a subsidy for building fishing vessels, together with a wide range of other proposals for expanding the fishing industry, was discussed at the Fisheries Development Conference held in Canberra in February last. The report of this meeting will be considered by Commonwealth and State fisheries officers and Ministers responsible for fishery matters at their next meeting, probably in September. </para>

                        <para>The only nuclear installation in Australia at present is at Lucas Heights, Sydney, and is owned and operated by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, a Commonwealth authority. The clause in insurance policies, under which loss of or damage to property is excluded from insurance cover if caused by radioactivity from any nuclear fuel, etc., therefore at the moment is to be related to damage arising out of the Commission's operations, and the Commission would bc liable at common law for any such loss or damage. As the Commonwealth would stand behind the Commission to ensure its ability to pay, it is not considered that- there is any need at present for special legislation in this field. It should be understood, of course, that the radioactive contamination exclusion clause, as it is called, does not exclude from insurance cover damage arising from the use of radioisotopes, X-ray apparatus, particle accelerators and the like. </para>

                        <para>The Government has been kept informed of developments in India arising from the drought and consequent shortages of food. </para>
                        <para>In recognition of the grave food situation in that country, the Government has made three large emergency food aid gifts to India since early 1965, amounting to almost $25m. In addition, Australia is continuing to provide India with aid for both technical assistance and economic development under the Colombo Plan. In aggregate Australian Colombo Plan aid to India now amounts to more than $30m. </para>
                        <para>In the Kennedy Round negotiations within the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff which concluded recently, Australia agreed to contribute annually for a period of three years 225,000 tons of grain, valued at approximately $ 13.5m, to a new international food aid agreement. Under this agreement, the details of which are now being worked out, Australia will be permitted to distribute its food aid contribution on a direct bilateral basis, if it chooses. Alternatively, it may be distributed through various multilateral channels. The Government will, of course, keep the situation in India under review in this context and consider sympathetically any further request from the Indian Government for additional emergency aid in the light of the requests it receives from the many other recipients of food aid. </para>

                       <para> Alleged practices of the kind referred to are not considered a matter for regulation under the Banking Act. However, at my request, the Governor of the Reserve Bank has discussed the matter with the general managers of the trading banks. I am advised that not all banks conduct travel business, but banks generally have informed the Reserve Bank that it is not their policy to make the granting of loans for travel purposes conditional on their handling the related travel business. </para>

In respect of a similar allegation made in the May 1967 issue of Travel Trade', the Reserve Bank has been advised by the bank concerned that this allegation' was fully investigated last year at the instigation of the Australian Federation of Travel agents. The bank was able to assure the Federation unequivocally that the customer's loan application was declined for reasons unrelated to the handling of the travel business. </para>

                    <para>There are no plans for retrenchment of any permanent parking staff who will be needed for other airport duties, such as traffic control. The Department expects a better net return from concession parking. As a condition of any contract let, the concessionaire would not be permitted to charge parking in excess of those approved by the Department. To ensure high standards, any contract let would he restricted to three years. </para>

In the early days of settlement in Western Australia it was more widespread and specimens were collected during the early and mid-19th century from the Perth area and other localities north of Perth. Whilst fossil records indicate that this marsupial has had a wide distribution in Western Australia, no definite records have been found of its previous existence in other parts of Australia. </para>

The native area  is very  sandy and shrub-covered, with much leaf litter around the shrubs. The shrubs include many largeflowered banksias. The animal possibly needs the litter for protection and the large flowers may represent an important component of its feeding requirements. None of these vegetational or soil conditions are available in the Australian Capital Territory, and the climatic conditions found here diverge significantly from those prevailing in the natural range of the animal. </para>

I begin by thanking those honourable senators who rose to support me in calling for this debate. This subject is one which concerns freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion and I thank those senators for their support for the principle of free discussion. </para>
                    <para>The issue of Vietnam has, of course, been for some years a highly controversial one in this country. In accordance with our democratic principles we have allowed free discussion of the issues involved on both sides and we have freely allowed the right to demonstrate within the limits, of course, required for the maintenance of civil order. There has been no suppression of debate. There was a notable instance of that last Sunday night when on a widely observed television programme called 'People', conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, a man who was declared to be an overseas authority upon napalm bombing was given the opportunity to express views strongly opposed to those of our Government on a session which is provided for out of the public funds. He was allowed to express those views without any opponent to question what he had to say. That, I think, is sufficient evidence to show that there is no suppression of dissent in this country. I may say that I propose to investigate an allegation that the man concerned is a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in the Scandinavian country from which he comes and that he is a European authority on causes with which the Communist Party is associated. But whatever his views, he was allowed to express them on a television session for which the Government provides the funds. As I said, that is sufficient answer to any claim that in Australia dissent is suppressed. </para>
                    <para>Of course, we now have a completely new issue. Up to date we have allowed debate in Australia for and against the Vietnam war and we have allowed the right to demonstrate. But now in Australia there is this move to obtain a completely new civil right - the right to aid the enemies of one's country; the right to send assistance to those who are fighting against Australian soldiers abroad. Those soldiers were sent abroad by the Government in accordance with the will of the Australian people as expressed at a Federal election. As honourable senators know, in that election the over-riding issue related to foreign policy, defence and the commitment of Australians abroad. By an overwhelming majority the Australian people determined that that involvement should be supported. Now there is an attempt within Australia to assert, as a civil right, the right to give aid to the enemies of our troops - the right to assist people who are trying to kill Australian soldiers. </para>
                    <para>It is ironical, I think, that this move should come from students at a university which bears the name of Australia's greatest soldier of World War I. The move began at Monash University, lt then spread to the Melbourne University; then to the Australian National University and now efforts are being made to bring about a similar campaign in other universities. This move is confined to a minority of the students. I pay tribute to the fact that the great majority, the overwhelming majority of students in our universities would not be associated with it. It is sponsored by a small, vocal, and in my opinion, politically sophisticated group associated with what are called the Labor clubs at these universities. </para>
                    <para>I know, of course, that these Labor clubs are not associated officially with the Australian Labor Party or with any other political party. In my day as an official of the Australian Labor Party we refused to associate with these clubs. We also refused to supply them with Labor speakers although I understand that this is not the case today. The Australian Labor Party and the Democratic Labor Party are not responsible for these groups. A person can become a member of one of these Labor clubs whether he has Labor views, Communist views, or no political views. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that on occasions people who claimed to be Liberals have joined these organisations. However, the groups have no official association with any political party so far as I know. Not all of the members of these clubs are merely crazed mixed up kids of whom we should not take much notice, as has been suggested. They themselves have pointed out that that is not the case. One of the spokesmen for this group. Ray Drew, was reported in the 'Canberra Times* last week as having said: </para>

                    <para>People who voted on the decision cannot be dismissed as 'little girls or boys'. Members of the Australian National University teaching staff were among those who voted approval. </para>
                    <para class="block">I want to make it clear that the Labor clubs at the universities do not consist merely of students; they also contain members of the teaching staff. I do not suggest that all of them are as suspect as some of them are. I believe that in the membership of some of these Labor clubs -  first  of all they contain small groups of idealists who have been indoctrinated to a degree that they have foolishly and misguidedly accepted what they have been told - there are some who are involved in this particular campaign because of the search for excitement. They find in this campaign the same sort of emotional release that they got ten or twelve years ago by playing cowboys and Indians and cops and robbers. But it is the members of the third group who are the subject of my chief condemnation. I refer to the politically sophisticated <inline font-style="italic">people who</inline> have been trained in the Eureka Youth League and other schools of the Communist Party to influence other students in directions which induce them to become associated' with this kind of campaign. </para>
                    <para>Whilst I say that some are idealists and some are just excitement chasers, I do not agree with those people who say that because they are young they are to be regarded as not being responsible; for their actions. If we as a Parliament say that young men of that age can be compelled to join the armed forces of this country and go abroad to fight under almost intolerable conditions, can we then turn round and <inline font-style="italic">say</inline> that men of the same age, safe at universities, are to be regarded as not being responsible for their actions? This particular group appears to have many spokesmen. </para>
                    <para class="block">In 'Fighting Words' last week, one of their spokesmen said that they had completed arrangements to send the aid through Algiers. In the newspapers this week, another spokesman said they had arranged to send it through Cambodia. A university student rang me this morning and informed me that he had learned from inquiries in Melbourne that they had arranged to send the aid to Saigon and that at Saigon sympathisers would transfer it to the Vietcong fighting outside that city. </para>
                    <para>Then we have other stories as to the nature of the aid. Some have sought to pretend virtue by saying that they will be merely sending medical aid. Surely if they send anti-malarial drugs that is military aid. If anti-malarial drugs will keep on their feet soldiers who will otherwise be out of action, what is the difference between that and military aid? </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> says my approach is callous. It is not as callous as that of those who would support the shooting of Australian soldiers with bullets paid for by Australians. I have not heard a word from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> in objection to that being done. Some people - I regret to say they include some in high places in this Parliament - have suggested that only a small amount of aid is involved and that action might well be taken if it increased to any considerable degree. As a matter of principle, it is just as objectionable to me if one or two Australian soldiers were killed as a result of moneys collected in Australia and forwarded to the Vietcong as it would be if 1,000 were so killed. I object to any suggestion that this thing should be overlooked because some people think that these students might not be sending a great deal of money. We are faced with a campaign which is not being conducted by a few immature children who do not know what they are doing or who are just out for excitement. We are faced with a campaign that is being waged by people who are politically sophisticated. As for the groups in the background, especially the adult groups to which I referred as being associated with these clubs, this is a carefully organised campaign designed to achieve an end which they regard as essential for their particular political ends. </para>

                    <para>Let me emphasise that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bowen,</inline> the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, who probably has sources of information that honourable senators have not got, stated at the week-end that he was satisfied that there were some persons associated with this campaign who were not perfectly honest. He said secondly, he was satisfied that it was an organised thing and, thirdly, that he was looking at the Crimes Act to see whether it should be applied in this particular case. </para>
                    <para>The object behind this campaign is very clear to anyone who has observed the activities of the Communist Party in this country over the years. The Communist Party realises that the amount of money to be collected by a campaign of this sort, although reasonably large, may not be very significant in the view of many people in a war where so much money is being expended. What it has in mind is another gain. It is seeking to promote the morale of the National Liberation Front to ensure that its members will fight on, that there will be no peace and that they will fight to a finish. That was made clear in a discussion at the University of Melbourne last week in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Francis</inline> James, a Sydney editor, was one of the participants. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James</inline> is not an immature schoolboy or an immature student; he has been over the course a few times.

Their aim is to strengthen the morale of the troops against whom our men are fighting. </para>
                    <para>Let me say that one of our own officers emphasised, in yesterday's 'Telegraph', the fact that morale was of importance in the case of our own troops. When referring to this campaign to aid the National Liberation Front, he said he hoped the Government of this country would do something to assure our troops that we were as anxious to stand behind them as they thought we were when they went away. It is all very well to say that it is only a little thing, that they are only a few boys. If we allow it to go on, it will be said all over the world that Australia sends troops to fight then allows money to be collected by Australians to be used for killing those troops. That lowers the image of this country  in  the eyes of the world and in the eyes of our allies, and no government in this country can afford to tolerate it. </para>
                    <para>I believe and I have the evidence  in  the number of communications that I have received from citizens, that the opinion of this country is almost entirely against this action. I might say that when I first heard of this matter I was in no hurry to intervene in it as I thought that it was one of those stunts that would not be heard of. Then it spread to another university and then to another university. Finally we reached the stage where these people assured us that they were out for two things. The first was to send aid; the second was to send messages which would strengthen the morale of those fighting our soldiers. I do not believe that any member of this Parliament who has a conscience could stand for a situation of conscripting men, sending them to fight  in  Vietnam and then turning around to allow people to collect money  in  this country for the assistance of those who are fighting against our men  in  Vietnam. Any member of this Parliament who would be prepared to support those people is unfit to be a member of the Parliament. </para>

If he was a member of the Australian Labor Party in 1949 tie should have been of that opinion then because, in 1949, two notable convictions for Communist sedition were obtained under section 24 of the Crimes Act, in each case by the Chifley Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">Burns and Sharkey were imprisoned for doing under the Chifley Labor Government. Frankly, what I want is the Holt Government to be just as firm and strong in stamping out treason in this country as the Chifley Government was. </para>
                    <para>How is the Government to act? There is  a  provision in the Crimes Act about which these young men who have a regard for their own safety, which contrasts oddly with their lack of concern for the safety of Australian troops in Vietnam, have let it be known that they went to the trouble of getting the very best legal opinion to ensure that up to the present they would be safe. Section 24aa (1.) of the Crimes Act provides that it is treachery for a person to assist by any means whatever, with intent to assist, a proclaimed enemy of a proclaimed country. It then goes on to provide that where a part of the Defence force is serving abroad, it is treachery to assist any persons against whom that part of the Defence force is or is likely to be opposed and who are specified or included in a class of persons specified by proclamation. Where they claim that they are safe is in this regard: they say that until the Government proclaims the NLF as a foe of this country, as an enemy at war with this country, they are quite safe in carrying on with what they are doing. 1 am not going to get involved in a legal discussion on whether this point or that point applies. I am going to suggest that the Government proclaims the NLF and then it will be in a position to deal with these people. I realise that they -may even say: 'Well, we will remove our campaign from the NLF. We will collect for the Vietcong or some other body.' I realise that there are loopholes which would need to be stopped up. Therefore, I have referred in my motion to the possibility of using other laws which could be examined by the law officers of the Crown. But if the Crown does not feel that there is a satisfactory law available, I urge the Crown to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley</inline> did when there was opposition to the erection of the Woomera Rocket Range. They saw to it that new legislation was prepared which would shut up all the loopholes. I ask the Government to do that if it finds that the Crimes Act is not properly or easily applicable. I am not impressed by suggestions that we use the currency regulations or other Acts to stop money going out of the country; that kind of thing is easily evaded. I believe that action which the Government must take must ensure that individuals will be dealt with if they attempt to raise money for this purpose. </para>
                    <para>Now, of course, anybody who has been associated with or seen the activities of Communists in this country over the years can easily work out the background behind this whole thing. The Communist Party over the last two or three years has stimulated one campaign here, one campaign there and another campaign somewhere else against the war in Vietnam. In this case, the Party decided to force the pace. It decided that it would try to establish the principle that there is a new civil right, the right to send aid to the enemies of one's country. Naturally, the Communist Party worked out a blueprint. It decided that it would start its campaign in one spot and see how it went. In other words, it is an exercise in brinkmanship to see whether the Government will react. If it does not react, the Communist Party has established a precedent. If the Government takes no action, then, instead of the universities, next week the Union of Australian Women, the women's organisation of the Communist Party, runs a fund to aid the NLF. The week after that, some other organisation such as a peace conference runs such a fund. What is going on at the moment is an attempt to try out the Government to see how far these people can go. </para>
                    <para>It is understandable that the Party started at Monash because it realises that in anything that is done in a university there is the inestimatable advantage that if anybody tries to step in the cry of academic freedom can be raised. There appears to be a lot of moral cowardice about today because, as far as I can see, people apparently are to be permitted to engage in everything from pornography to treason; and some people suggest: 'Well, as long as you say it is academic freedom, it is all right'. These people therefore have set to work to establish a precedent in the same way as they established a precedent when they stopped the 'Boonaroo' from carrying supplies to Vietnam. They successfully established the precedent that Australian workers could refuse to supply Australian troops abroad. Now, here is the next stage - to establish the precedent that money can be collected in this country to aid the enemies of this country. I say therefore that this is not a precedent which any government worthy of its salt would accept. I call upon the Government of this country to act. </para>
                    <para>Before I leave the students, as I have referred to the question of academic freedom, I think it is necessary to look at the frame of mind which some of them have. Tony Baker wrote a letter to the 'Canberra Times' last week. He explained how he came to be the mover of the motion to send aid to the National Liberation Front at the Australian National University. He wrote: </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is entirely explicable thai university students should have sponsored the motion. We are freed from the demands and inhibitions of a job, as the community has instructed us to devote a few years purely to study. From this point of isolation we have a duty to advocate -what we have learnt, even if it be unpopular with many in the community. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is the attitude of a young man who says: 'The world owes me a living. The community has sent me here for a few years to study'. In the typical tone of academic freedom, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> he says that during the period for which he is isolated from the community he can do things that you and I cannot do, because he is a university student. Some people today are trying to twist the principle of academic freedom in all kinds of strange and weird ways. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased to see that the Council of Monash University does not believe in that kind of academic freedom. According to a Press article, Professor Andrew, the Acting Vice-Chancellor of that University, notified students that no University facility could he used or any collection taken up on the campus for funds directed towards any combatant or political group of the National Liberation Front, and official notices to that effect were posted around the University. He said that students who disregarded the order would face disciplinary action; that they could be fined up to $100, suspended or expelled from the University. Of course, students can still do these things outside the University. But, if the University thinks it should take that action, I hope that the Government will do something in that direction. </para>
                    <para>A few comments which rather surprised me have been made in regard to this matter. The Melbourne 'Age', in a leading article in which it elevated me to the High Court bench, suggested that it was entirely wrong for a member of parliament to suggest in parliament legal action against people. I have not been able to find! any parliamentary authority who can confirm that. On the contrary, I am informed1 that the kind of action that I am taking has been taken by members of parliament for centuries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rohan</inline> Rivett suggested; that the students could not possibly be charged because the Commonwealth Government was sending wheat to China and it would have to be charged, too. I do not know that that analogy is entirely valid. I merely say that it certainly does not apply to members of my Party because we have been the only party to oppose the sending of wheat to Communist China. That is still our attitude. We have always been consistent. </para>

                        <para>-^- The first point that I wish to make in this debate is that I disagree with the leading article that took <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> to task because he dared to raise this matter in a house of parliament. I agree with his contention. It is not that a house of parliament should take action against somebody for a criminal act; it is that any member of a house of parliament, who sees a situation developing in which he believes that a law should be applied or a law is required, has the right to raise that matter for debate in the house of parliament to which he belongs: The second point that I wish to make is that, although this is the occasion for a debate on this matter, this is not the first occasion on which the Government has directed its mind to the problem and all its implications. I would not like it to be thought that until now the Government has not devoted attention to what is implied in this latest development in Australia. J say 'latest development in Australia' because this is a development that has not occurred here before. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Before I go on to discuss this development, I point out that universities and university students have figured fairly prominently in this debate and in the Press reports leading up to it That is only natural. </para>
                    <para class="block">But it should be made perfectly clear that the vast bulk of university students and universities themselves as organisations are not involved in this matter. Sometimes I become very annoyed because whenever there is a noisy demonstration in .which young people are involved the newspapers seem automatically to say that they are students, without any proof whatever that they are students or that they are attending a university. I believe that the vast bulk of the people who attend our universities as students are hard working, sensible and good citizens of Australia. In many ways they are better than the university students of the time when I attended university. So I hope that the Australians who have resentment against the action which is the subject of this debate will not allow that resentment to wash over into condemnation of university students as a whole. </para>
                    <para>What are the numbers involved in this action? As I understand the position, in the Monash University Labor Club thirtythree students out of a student body of about 8,000 voted in favour of this action. In the University of Melbourne Labor Club forty-five students voted in favour of it In the Australian National University Labor Club the vote was fourteen to eight. So this is not the action of university students as such; it is the action of a minute particle of a small section of university students. That does not make it any the less significant. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> said, if it is permissible for one small group to collect money to buy bullets to kill Australian soldiers, then it is permissible for other small and large groups to do so. Once that principle is supported or defended, it is supported or defended for groups of all kinds and sizes. So this is not a matter to be dismissed because so far only a small number of university students, being manipulated from outside and being used as guinea pigs, are collecting a small amount of money for these purposes. </para>
                    <para>Let us isolate what is at issue here. It is not a question of freedom of expression or freedom of speech. Every honourable senator will appreciate that in this country, in the present state of undeclared hostilities with North Vietnam, those people who wish to change the Government's policy are being given all facilities to persuade the </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian people that that policy should be changed. They are able, as they should be, to put their views over radio and television and in the newspapers. That is not at issue. That is not the question before us at all; nor, in my view, is the collection of money by people who, for humanitarian reasons, have compassion for suffering humanity and wish to send medical supplies of one kind and another, although I believe that the use of the statement that the collections are being made for those purposes is an act of deceit by the people making the collections. I say that because money has been collected before in Australia for the International Red Cross to forward medical supplies to people who were hurt or rendered homeless in North and South Vietnam. The Red Cross has stated that it is not allowed into North Vietnam; that it made application to enter North Vietnam and was refused permission by Hanoi on the ground that North Vietnam was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention. So the suggestion that the money now to be collected would be distributed through the International Red Cross in giving aid of that kind is deceitful to those people who know the facts. </para>
                    <para>A suggestion has also been made that the World University Service might be involved in helping in North and South Vietnam in non-warlike ways with the funds collected. The suggestion has inspired a letter to me by the Australian  President  of the World University Service in which he has pointed out how grossly the position of the Service has been misrepresented by the Students Representative Council at Melbourne University, and that the Service was not allowed to operate and would not operate in North Vietnam. He has pointed out in his letter that there is no World University Service committee in North Vietnam and that no projects are therefore supported there by the Service. He disassociates himself not only from the request of the Students Representative Council at Melbourne University for medical aid, but also from what he terms the lunatic efforts of the university clubs at Melbourne University and later Monash University to collect money for other than medical purposes. That is a reference to the possibility of aid being provided in that way. I would not at present take issue with people of compassion who would collect money for medical aid to be given through the International Red Cross, if it were possible for that scheme to work. But the collection of funds for purposes other than that - to be given to the political arm which has troops in the field fighting Australians and for purposes which do not exclude military actions - gives rise to a situation in this country that we have not seen before. Further, the funds are collected knowing that to be the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Price,</inline> a student at Monash University - although many of the members of the Labor Club there are not - was under no illusions about the purposes for which the funds might be used. He made the statement that it would be unfortunate if an Australian conscript was hit by a bullet with 'Monash University Labor Club' on it, but he said: 'We do not see any way out of this'. I suggest that it would be equally unfortunate if a member of the Australian Regular Army as a volunteer was hit by  a  bullet with 'Monash University Labor Club' on it, or if the head man of a South Vietnamese village and his wife and family were lined up against a wall and shot as an act of terrorism with bullets with Monash University Labor Club' on them. So that funds are being collected knowing that they may be distributed and used for purposes of that kind. I take the view that it is intolerable for that to happen; that no government should permit it to continue; that ways must be found to stop the collection and the dispatch of money to people who, in a legal sense or otherwise, are shooting at Australian troops as their enemies. </para>
                    <para>How can this situation be stopped? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> has pointed out, difficulties arise in the use of the Crimes Act. I do not say that it is impossible to use the Crimes Act, but there are difficulties in its use which could lead to changes in the suggested purposes of the collection of funds, every time that a particular organisation - the Vietcong, the National Liberation Front or the North Vietnamese Government - was proclaimed. This oddity, this difficulty, of preventing such action is something which has been brought to notice for the first time. Of course, the same thing could have happened when Australian troops were engaged against guerillas in Malaya, had there been at that time sufficient disloyal Australians, because no declaration of war was made against guerillas in Malaya. Had sufficient Australians been willing to supply munitions to be used to shoot other Australians at the time when Australia was engaged in Korea, the same thing could have happened, because no official declaration of war was made against Korea., But it did not happen then because .there were no people prepared to say: 'It will be unfortunate if what we do results in the shooting of Australian soldiers, but we cannot help that. We will just have to put up with it'. But it is happening now and it is intolerable. Every existing avenue open to the Government must be examined most carefully to see whether it can be 'used effectively so that the end desired is attained. If it appears that existing facilities cannot be used effectively to make sure that the end desired is attained, then a look must be taken toward effecting an alteration which will make that result possible, How.ever this is not a matter that can be accomplished overnight. So far no crime has been committed by any of the people who are collecting funds for munitions for Vietcong soldiers. It is intolerable that that should be able to continue. I dissociate completely myself and my Party and the Australian Country Party from the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bryant,</inline> a leading member of the Australian Labor Party, that attempts to prevent the collection of funds for such purposes are a negation of the democratic system. </para>

                            <para>- Can the honourable senator not see the distinction in the items I have mentioned? He does not answer me. If he can see the distinction, that is fine; we are all of one mind. However, I am talking to the point <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> said was raised by a radio commentator. I point out that apparently all of us here can  see  the great distinction between trading with another country in wheat and wool and providing what can be actual munitions of war for use against Australian troops in a third country. If there is no distinction in the mind of the honourable senator who is now interjecting, then obviously he would allow both. </para>

Irrespective of whether the honourable senator was at the meeting of that Labor club, irrespective of whether he addressed that Labor club, the fact still remains that there is an association between some Victorian members of the Opposition Party and those Labor clubs and they could use their influence to prevent action of the kind now under discussion. That is the point I was making. </para>

                            <para>-  Yes it was. That is the point I was making and that is the point I make now. We know that there are people in Australia - a minority, not many - who believe that the action being taken by the Australian Government in Vietnam is wrong. We know that a majority of people in Australia, voting on this subject, indicated that they believed that the action of the Australian Government was right. The majority of people in Australia having so expressed themselves and the Australian Government having taken action to implement its policy in that way, surely no-one with any pretension to democratic principles, either in that majority or in that minority, can say that those who disagree with the Government's policy should be allowed to collect money for munitions to be used by those fighting against us. This is a very dangerous precedent and it is one to which the Government will give consideration. </para>

                        <para>-  This motion and the support it has received from the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton),</inline> who is supposed to represent in this chamber the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> also set a dangerous precedent. The motion is a disgrace to the Senate. That the Senate should discuss a motion, the substance of which is that action should be taken under the Crimes Act against certain persons, is something that should never be entertained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> did not stop at suggesting that legal action should be taken against persons. He did not merely say that he thought those persons should be investigated.  His  attitude was that they , were already guilty. He expressed himself in terms which indicated, that there was no doubt whatever that they were guilty and should be punished by imprisonment. That is something which should never be permitted in a chamber of this character. This is not a magistrate's court ' and it should riot be turned into one. </para>

Wc disagree with their attitude and! their decisions, and we have said so publicly. The executive of the Australian Labor Party has resolved this matter and the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party has today issued an announcement in connection with it. There can be no question on that aspect. The processes of the Senate should not be abused in this way.

                        comes in here not saying, as he would be entitled to say: 'Let us agree to a motion that steps or procedures ought to be taken to prevent the raising of moneys'. He says that his proposal is based on the necessity for action under the Crimes Act, that this is in effect a Communist conspiracy, that these people are guilty. He then goes on to say, virtually, that they ought to be sentenced to imprisonment because it is more serious than a certain offence committed by men who were sent to prison. What is. that but trying them in this .Senate, where they cannot be heard and where they have no public trial, finding them guilty and saying. what sentence should be imposed. If this can be done to them it can be done to anyone else in this community; there ; is no doubt whatever about that.

How should it be enforced? lt should be enforced, first, by a responsible investigation of the facts by the executive arm of government, which should carry a reputation for integrity and efficiency, and which usually has a reputation for impartiality in the investigation of crime. Then if the executive arm commits itself to the opinion that there is a prima facie case, the basic assumption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus's</inline> proposal is that that case should be presented in public court to be adjudicated upon by the appropriate tribunal, be that a judge or jury, and after a complete opportunity for defence on the part of everyone concerned a conviction or acquittal should be registered. </para>
                    <para>The idea that I should sit silent' in this Senate when it is implied by the leader of one of the parties that, when one member of the Parliament puts forward the point of view that in the public interest and in the interests of the security of the Commonwealth and its defence forces action, should be taken to enforce the law, that we are adding evidence of guilt against any person or are depriving that person of an impartial and free right to be tried by a British court, fills me with disappointment. I did not think I should hear this from the Leader of the Opposition, from whom I sometimes hear with pride a defence of civil liberties. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> acknowledged, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> ' most fairly acquitted the Australian Labor Party, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> leads in this chamber, of any complicity with these people, and then went on to say what a previous Labor Government had done in a case merely of seditious words, not followed by action. </para>
                    <para>That was the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> was making in distinguishing this case from that of Burns and Sharkey. The Government of 1949 prosecuted Burns and Sharkey for seditious words applicable to a hypothetical occasion, If aggressive Soviet forces came to this country they would be welcomed, said Sharkey - according to my memory of his seditious words. But there Was no chance of Soviet forces coming to this country. We had no troops on the coast to resist them. There was no suggestion that Sharkey had raised a fund and would be there to welcome them in something like the way that Casement was on the Irish coast, according to the judgment of the courts, to receive German arms, to bring them and to apply them against British forces. </para>
                    <para>The distinction that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> was making between this case and that of Burns and Sharkey was that they had simply uttered seditious words, applicable to a hypothetical occasion. But here we have a situation where our troops are in hostilities engaged with people who are at war with our troops. It is an undeclared war but nevertheless this Parliament has taken the responsibility - I have said here on former occasions that it is one of the most searching responsibilities that any member of the Parliament can take - of passing laws for the compulsory military service of our men there. In this situation it is suggested and publicised that people are not merely using words. Those words I have not seen but I listened in a stunned fashion when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> shy that one person had said that he was indifferent as to whether or not a bullet that killed an Australian soldier had the badge of his club on it because his money had bought it. That is the substance of the words as I understood them. </para>
                    <para>Those alone are words, but then if there is activity of a concerted nature among groups to get together money to buy materials, it is far from contributing to the disgrace of the Senate for a senator to stand here and draw the attention of the Government to the use of words of that sort in relation to Australian troops facing an enemy in Vietnam and action to contribute to material that might be used against our troops. The Government's attention ought to be drawn on the floor of a House of the Parliament to that situation. That is why people elect us to represent their views. There should be no hesitation whatever in the proper application of the law to the situation, first by police investigation. The police are trained to sift evidence in many ways. If in the judgment of the responsible law officers there is a case to go before a court, it would be beggaring Parliament to suggest that anything said in a parliamentary debate should prejudice a trial. It will be dealt with by our courts and by our juries, unprejudiced. </para>

                            <para>- What nonsense. A member of Parliament, when he knows of a possible contravention of the law, discharges a duty in the public interest by bringing it to the Parliament for discussion. Irresponsible discussion, the purpose of which is to prejudice the impartial trial of the individuals concerned, should be deprecated on the floor of the Senate. So, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I have risen because whenever I go from this place 1 will go cherishing a memory that I have stood on many occasions to defend the individual right of people to be properly tried according to British traditions both for criminal matters and' for civil matters. I rise to express my deep disappointment that an attempt has been made to distort this debate by an implication that the very fundamental basis of it is to convict the people concerned. </para>

                    <para>The proposal is that we should discuss a matter of urgency, namely, the necessity for action under the Crimes Act and\/or other applicable legislation - that is, action under the relevant laws of this country. Against whom? Burns, Sharkey, Smith, Jones or Brown? No. lt is against persons in Australia proposing to solicit and send aid for the National Liberation Front of Vietnam. The proposal does not even mention an individual. It does not name an association. It refers to persons who are engaging in activities that are described objectively, persons who are proposing to solicit and send aid for the National Liberation Front of Vietnam. Action should be taken under the laws of the country for the purpose of applying the laws of the country, and is there anybody in this chamber who is so weak as not to listen to that with a stimulus to his pride, realising that to take action under those laws against anybody who was endeavouring to subvert the efforts of our troops would be acting in the required defence of our troops? I hope that the Senate will now deal with the subject matter on its merits, unprejudiced by the implication that we are to judge any particular persons or to debate any other matter than this, a proposition that it is appropriate for the Government to address its attention to the matter immediately, to take action first by way of investigation and then to put the matter to the courts for trial. </para>

Even though  1  may be exhausting his- patience  1 ask  that he  allow  me the same silence. If the  only'  purpose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> had in  mind  was to see that some persons who have committed some offence were brought' before the courts, then a way was available to him to have this done. He could have instituted proceedings himself. If he believed that at the present time the provisions  of  the Crimes Act, as amended in I960, were  nol  adequate to deal with the particular matters  lo  which he was referring, because no countries had been proclaimed, then there was nothing to stop, him from merely moving that certain areas and certain persons be proclaimed as enemy areas and enemy persons. But none  of  these things have been clone. - Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' .Wright</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> mentioned  no  persons by name, that is  not  the fact. The name  of  one, Tony Baker, and the.  name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> -Francis James have been mentioned in this discussion. One can only conclude that if people believe.  What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> said, then his statements would be  of  the . utmost prejudice to the persons concerned if they were brought to trial. </para>

                        has adopted what seems to me to be a. rather curious- approach to this whole question. He said that he came along here to defend freedom  of  -speech.

                        went on to speak about the aims of the Communist Party. He- said that it was one of the Party's aims to create such activities as are at present taking place at Monash University and elsewhere. In order to prove that this is the case what did .the honourable senator do but to quote some statements made by

                        James. In -order to prove that the Communist Party has certain objectives in mind about the morale of the Vietcong and of members of the National Liberation  Front, did he quote a member of the Communist Parly?. No; he quoted

                        James. -.

                        said that certain people are so cowardly that they are afraid to stand up and be counted in the same way that others have to stand up. He said that they lurk behind some claim lo academic freedom- that they should be able to say things which other people are not able to say. I know some people who lurk behind parliamentary privilege in order to say things that other people are not able to say. When'
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline>
                        accuses these people  of  lurking' behind claims to academic freedom, I would like to know whether he is going to lurk behind parliamentary privilege or whether he will say outside this chamber what he said about the visiting Scandinavian scientist and what he said about

                        James. Until

                        does this I do not think he is in a position to criticise any person for lurking behind academic freedom or lurking behind anything else.

                        referred also to Doctor Evatt. It is rather curious how
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt's</inline>
                        name came into this discussion. We are told that in order to vindicate the arguments that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline>
                        put forward we should refer back to what
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline>
                        did in 1949 when he was instrumental in prosecuting two members of the Communist Party. I would have thought that was a most curious authority for him to quote. As I recollect the position
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline>
                        and the members of his Party based most of their political fortunes on accusations that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline>
                        himself was a Communist or a representative of the Communists. Apparently, now that he is dead, he was not a Communist at all but was there fearlessly exposing the Communists and bringing them to trial. I do not wish to spend a great deal of time on what
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline>
                        had to say because this is a political stunt. He is not seriously interested in obtaining a prosecution. All he is interested in doing is smearing certain individuals who do not have the same opportunity as he has to reply. For example, he links
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Francis</inline>
                        James with the Communist Party and says about him in this chamber things that I do not think he will be saying outside the chamber. He then says if the action of these students is successful the Union of Australian Women or the Seamen's Union will do something. He mentions not only people who are supposed to have done something already; he mentions people who he says will do something if the designs of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Francis</inline>
                        James and the other presumed Communists are carried out. This is put to us by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>
                        as a serious effort to have the matter brought before the courts. I would like to ask
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>
                        how the references to the Union of Australian Women and the Seamen's Union become relevant to the proposition that proceedings should be taken against certain individuals  under the Crimes Act.

                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline>
                        spoke about offences which have been committed, whether in a legal sense or otherwise. He idly brushed the matter aside. Virtually, what he said was this: 'Does it matter whether there is an offence in the legal sense or not? Let us not worry about the law. An offence has been committed, whether or not the law prohibits the alleged offence.' Then he proceeded to give us a most inaccurate .survey of all the developments that have; taken place. He stated that I spoke to the University of Melbourne Labor Club in July of this year. I do not wish to call the Minister a liar, but I would say that whoever informed him that I spoke at the University of Melbourne Labor Club in July of this year is a liar. I have never spoken at the University of Melbourne Labor Club' in my life.

I think the point has been; made that inaccurate statements have been made by the Minister in support of a general proposition. The position is that an Offence either has been committed or has not been committed. If an offence has not been committed then what we are seeing enacted in the Senate today is a complete farce. We are seeing people falsely accused of having committed an offence which in fact they did not commit - that is, if no offence has been committed. If an offence has been committed then what we are seeing is something which is much more serious indeed. </para>

Nor is it within the ambit of the duties of senators to come into the Senate and make wild statements about what they think ought to be done with regard to legal prosecutions. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> or anybody else thinks that somebody ought to be prosecuted, the procedures are available under the existing legislation. If the Government has not proclaimed as enemies those people which it should have proclaimed, then that is a censure of the Government and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> himself. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> the Minister representing the Attorney-General, was doing today was in fact censuring his own Government. The Opposition is completely opposed to this proposition. We believe it has nothing to do with the Senate. </para>

Finally, because there was some time left to him, he got around to debating the question in the last few minutes of his speech. I am just wondering whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was bothered by his conscience in discussing this matter. Was he in a spot? Was he perhaps casting his mind back to last Sunday week, to the Hiroshima Day protest march in which the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party took part and in which its members were accompanied by university students carrying Vietcong flags? Perhaps his conscience was troubling him a little. I do not know. I leave his conscience to him. </para>

                            <para>- Although I rise to support the proposal I am very sorry that the Senate has to debate such a matter, because the handful of people concerned may feel as a result of the debate that they are important people. We might be giving them a false sense of importance. I support the proposal because of the mothers and fathers of the sons who have already been killed up in Vietnam. At least we owe it to them to give this matter some sort of public airing. I support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> has said. If the present powers contained in the legislation are insufficient, then it should not be beyond the wit of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> to produce some form of legislation to deal with situations such as this. Before the debate started I thought that such legislation would have been supported by the Australian Labor Party. After today's effort. 1 am quite sure we would not have its support at all. </para>

                            <para>- It is not sub judice. It is not before a court. The honourable senator knows that as well as 1 do. I would like the bush lawyer to tell me how this matter is sub judice. I am not a lawyer, but I say it is not sub judice. One of these young men had the hide to say to an active footballer from Essendon who had just returned from active service that the Australian troops, sitting in a ditch firing at people, could not know what the war was really about. Fancy a young man who has all the security and protection of a deferment, and who is attending a university, going to a man who has served his country in Vietnam and saying to him: 'You would not know what it is all about*. I suppose that the name of this silly young man should be mentioned. Grinberg is his name. It has been mentioned in the Press. He maintains that he knows in the security and comfort of the Melbourne University more about a war being fought thousands of miles away than the men who have been fighting there and who have done their stint there to support this sort of individual. A lot more was said by some of these young men who came home yesterday. Most of their remarks sum up very briefly and to the point what the soldiers who are doing this job feel about it. A 22-year old soldier who has done his term up there said: 'I would like to meet some of these eggheads in an alley.' I am sure that that is the feeling of a number of the young men serving up there. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the honourable senator did read it. It may be that some people listening to this broadcast today have not read this. They may like to hear interjections such as that from the honourable senator and to know where he stands on this matter. He should stand up and be counted and say whether he agrees that what the students are doing is right or wrong. I say categorically as a serviceman for six years in the last war that this is wrong. A person - my son or even the honourable senator's son - should not be put into uniform and sent to these areas where in some cases he is defending what we believe is our first line of defence if aid is given to the very enemy who is out i there to shoot him. If the honourable senator believes that is right, let him stand up. be counted and tell the Australian people where he stands on the matter. Do not hide as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> did. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> ran away from this debate by attacking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus-</inline></para>

What I want to know is who is behind these silly young men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> pointed out that this handful of young men numbered ninety-two - that is, if we take the numbers from the three universities - out of some thousands of young people who are at our universities. Only ninety-two are concerned in this matter. Who is behind them? That is the important factor to bc answered. I wonder whether these people have not been given some solace respecting their ideas as to what should be happening in this country by virtue of the fact that about the time this matter first arose the Australian Labor Party adopted certain policies concerning Vietnam which were almost identical with the terms that Hanoi had put up for a settlement of the war. One of these was that the bombing of North Vietnam be stopped. </para>

The ALP should contest its policy at the next election. It knows what happened to it at the last election. </para>

                        <para>- It is not clear whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> and those who are supporting him on this matter are directing the burden of their attack at the students who are guilty of this irresponsible conduct, at the Government or at the Opposition. But, whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> may think about the issues in this debate, I remind him that the Senate is not discussing the policy of the' Australian Labor "Party on Vietnam. It is discussing a' motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus.</inline> The attitude of the Australian Labor Party on the issue of Vietnam has been stated clearly on many occasions. Whatever one may think about that policy, in favour of it or against it, it is not an issue in this debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> and other people who have supported him have conceded that there are wide differences of opinion in the community on the issue of Vietnam. It is quite absurd for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> to look at members of the Labor Party, which has a clearly stated policy of opposition to Australia's participation in the war in Vietnam, and by some, sort of innuendo to blame our Party for what these students are doing. That is nonsense. It is ridiculous. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>One wonders why this motion has been brought forward at this time. From what has been said not only by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> hut also by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> who led for the Government in this debate, it is perfectly obvious that this matter has been directed to the attention of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen).</inline> Apparently that did not satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus.</inline> So what is he seeking to do in moving this motion? Last week he blazed away in print in the Press, apparently without ever having read the Crimes Act. He  said: 'Charge these students with treason'. That was the great headline in the Melbourne Press, at any rate. Then he retreated a little and said: What we should do is make certain proclamations under the Crimes Act'. </para>
                    <para>Finally, although the Attorney-General said over the weekend that he had looked at the matter and was continuing to keep it under his attention, that did not appease <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus.</inline> He wanted to make a big show in the Senate. He wanted to involve the Government. He has succeeded in doing that. He has involved the  Deputy  Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton),</inline> who represents the Minister for External Affairs and the Attorney-General, in an attack on the Attorney-General. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton's</inline> speech amounted to. Either he was lending himself to an attack on the Attorney-General or he was admitting that the Government is completely unable to deal with situations in terms of its own law-enforcing armoury and competence. In other words, his speech was a confession of failure on the part of the Government. </para>
                    <para>For the benefit of people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> who will continue to make the innuendo, we have to make it clear - as my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> did a minute or two ago - that we do not support the action of these students; that we as the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party have dissociated ourselves from it; and that our Party in Victoria has made it perfectly clear that it is in complete disagreement with what is being done by these students. </para>

What is involved is the action of some students, and further to that, there is involved an attempt in this chamber to magnify for political purposes the actions of student's in two universities in Melbourne and in the Australian National University. </para>

I want to make sure that honourable senators opposite and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> take care that the means they are using here are appropriate to the ends; that they are not using a sledge hammer to crack a nut. In another place this afternoon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt),</inline> while saying the things one would expect him to say in defending the position of the Government, and while being very critical of the students, nevertheless said: </para>

                    <para class="block">It is a very sensible statement to make and I cannot find for it anything other than agreement. I only wish that the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> who spoke on behalf of the Government in this debate, had exercised the same degree of temperance about the matter. I wish also that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> in dealing with this question had not drawn the long bow so much. The Senate will not try these students, nor will it determine their guilt or innocence. Certainly the Senate is not to determine whether they should be hanged, drawn and quartered or merely burnt at the stake. The Senate should behave like a House of Parliament. It is not the function of the Senate to heap iniquity upon iniquity and decide upon what young people in Victoria or elsewhere have done. 1 am simply saying that we will not allow the Senate to be turned into a place where any senator can say 'I accuse' and point an accusing bony finger at somebody outside this Parliament who cannot speak here in his own defence. Of course, not only is an accusation levelled against people outside this Parliament; it is levelled snidely against the Opposition. But primarily, it is levelled against the Government and the Government should not be behaving as though it had nothing to answer for. It is a Government which gives tacit support to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus'</inline> motion. It is a government which thinks nothing of making China one of our largest customers for wheat and wool. It is a government which at one time was prepared to allow the export of tallow, a vital material, to North Vietnam. It is complete and utter hypocrisy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> or anybody else who is speaking on behalf of the Government to adopt in this chamber a holier than thou attitude and to point the finger at a few students who have obviously acted -in a silly and irresponsible way. I would hope that all honourable senators would speak on this matter as responsibly as I do on this occasion. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do not wish to dissent. I have too much respect for the  President  to do that. I do not want either to waste the valuable time that I have in this debate. The Minister for Repatriation is continually anxious to try to throw me out of my stride. He is a member of a Ministry which appears to be, if its own case is correct, derelict of its duty. Honourable senators opposite cannot have it at both ends of the candle. They have to decide whether they will resist the motion or, if supporting it. accept their share of the responsibility. The whole idea is preposterous. -. 1 hope these young students will see the error of their ways. I do not agree wilh what they have done, and the Australian Labor Party does not agree with what they have done. I do not think they have done any special service to those who have tried successfully to formulate a coherent case against the Government's Vietnam policy. That is what the Labor Party has been doing in recent times and that is what we will continue to do. We do not need their advice. As I have said, we do not agree with what they have done. However, we think that the methods which have been adopted in the Senate on this occasion are out of all proportion. We do not believe that the Parliament is the place to try these issues. </para>

                    <para>I think it would bc fitting for me to remind the House and the country of the origins of the so-called National Liberation Front. We have previously said that it is not national in any true sense, nor does it propose to liberate in any true sense as we understand that term. The plan to form a liberation front in South Vietnam was formulated at a congress of the North Vietnam Communist Party in September 1960. The National Liberation Front is a creature of the North Vietnam Communist Party and does not constitute an organisation of internal revolt independent of Hanoi. It is an instrument of external aggression and subversion and. together with the regular forces of North Vietnam, is directed from Hanoi. That being the character of the organisation, any Australian who would knowingly give material aid to this body, and do so at the hazard of Australian lives, deserves the utter condemnation of this Parliament, and from this Government should expect appropriate action both to prevent material aid going forward and to deal appropriately with these activities wherever they are engaged in. </para>
                    <para class="block">There could not be any clearer enunciation than that of the Government's policy and of where we stand. 1 was interested to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say that the Labor Party's Vietnam policy is not involved in this. I want to deal with that situation shortly because I think the Labor Party's Vietnam policy is involved in this. [ think that the objective of the university Labor clubs and the policy of the Australian Labor Party run side by side. They are parallel. They are both directed towards raising the morale of the Vietcong and keeping the Vietcong fighting. Let us look at Labor Party policy on this aspect. The Labor Party would tell the United States to stop bombing North Vietnam, to recognise the National Liberation Front as a representative negotiator of the Vietnamese people, to change the war into a holding  operation and to stop using napalm and other objectionable weapons in Vietnam. If the Americans did not accept the Labor Party's policy the Labor Party, when it came to office, would pull Australian troops out of Vietnam. That is what the Labor Party has said and there is no question about it. </para>

                            <para>- The Opposition wants to hide its policy. I know honourable senators opposite do not like what I am saying but that will not stop me. I was saying that there is a sinister organisation behind this small number of duped students in the university Labor clubs which, as I understand it, have nothing to do with the Australian Labor Party although the Australian Labor Party has been a long time denying any connection with them. The Australian Labor Party has been a long time finding this out. This University Labor Club has been going on for years and years. This is the first time that I have ever heard any member of the Opposition say that the University Labor Club was not connected with the Australian Labor Party. Never mind, they said so today. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition have said so. I am prepared to accept their statement, belated though it is. </para>

                    <para>Nobody would do other than encourage any organisation which collected funds for medical aid in Vietnam. If such funds were collected no one would have any objection to their being sent through the International Red Cross. Perhaps if the funds were big enough the International Red Cross would be able to get into North Vietnam. At the present time it is excluded. The North Vietnamese do not want anybody in there to sec what is going on. Funds collected for medical aid should go through the International Red Cross. If that was the purpose of the university students no one would object to it. But this fund is being raised for unspecified purposes other than for medical aid. One of the people who are associated with it - he should be forever ashamed - has said: 'It would be unfortunate if an Australian conscript was hit by a bullet with "Monash University Club" on it, but we do not see that there is any way out of that'. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> has already stated that we are now examining the means dealing with this action. What is more, if existing legislation is not sufficient we will introduce legislation to see that the matter can be dealt with effectively. It will be very interesting to see where the Australian Labor Party stands if such legislation comes before this House. The matter will be dealt with and dealt with very shortly. </para>

                    <para>We have to remember that these boys in Vietnam are fighting Communist aggression to maintain the independence of a small State. They are fighting on our front line. These boys are prepared to go there and fight for us, and no government can condone the raising of funds to purchase what might be, as this lad has said, bullets to kill our own boys fighting in this area. We want these boys who are fighting to know that this Government is behind them, that it supports them and that it knows full well that they are carrying out its policy. This policy was put to the people of Australia who returned us to office with an overwhelming majority. We did not put forward a policy, as did the Australian Labor Party, of pulling out troops; our policy was. to go there and defend this small country of Vietnam; to stem Communist aggression, and to show that aggression does not pay. The sooner we make this understood, the sooner we will get peace in this world. </para>
                    <para>I have made the position of the Government quite clear. Nothing is more heartening to the Vietcong than to have, on the one hand, the University Labor Club collecting funds and, on the other hand, to have the Australian Labor Party's policy so shaped that they know that if ever the Labor Party got into office in this country it would pull our troops out. This is what is sustaining the Vietcong. The longer the Vietcong are sustained the more lives of Vietnamese, Australian and American servicemen will be lost. They are sustained by these unthinking dupes who are ruled from behind by a sinister organisation which is carrying out psychological warfare in Australia. </para>

                        <para>Ratbags or Just Good Fun? Why do they DO these things? Why is it that some undergraduates seem forever determined to do the wrong thing in terms of the accepted norms of sensible behavior and public opinion? Why do they persist in attitudes which inevitably result in university students so often being branded, generally, as a bunch of ratbags? These are age old questions which are being debated all over again in the light of the goings on at Monash and Melbourne Universities in the past few days.' </para>

                    <para>The charge that these students are guilty of treason is a very serious one; it is one that we are not used to hearing lin this country during hostilities. In the past people have been united, in the efforts of the country in time of war. It is a reflection 'on the Government itself that the issues of Vietnam are so confused that on one side of the spectrum there are people who want 'to drop thermo nuclear bombs on Hanoi and Peking straight away to finish the war, and on the other side of the spectrum we have university students and ratbags, or whatever you like to call them, wanting to send aid and comfort. It is a reflection on the Government itself that this state of affairs is Showing up in the. community when our country is involved in war. lt shows that the war itself is creating grave doubts in the community as to its morality. I believe, that it is an immoral war. </para>

We were sucked into putting observers into Vietnam, then gradually increasing them, and then bringing in the South East Asia Treaty Organisation pact, which was not supported by all of the signatories of SEATO. Little by little- he that con.tendeth small things falls little by little - this country and the United States fell into the position in which they are today. Therefore, there is this confusion in the community as to whether or not we should be in there, whether or not we should be suing for peace, whether or not we did the right thing in not trying to persevere with the United Nations, and whether or not we should have referred the matter back to the Geneva powers, which in the final analysis were responsible for the line of demarcation and will probably still have to handle the matter when peace eventually comes in this war torn country. </para>

                    <para>Here today we are having blown up out of all proportion the actions of some people. Someone has said that ninety-two persons were involved in this. As was mentioned in the 'Age', these people themselves are pro- bably bathing in the notoriety - to think that they can have a full dress debate in the Senate. I . have heard of university students commandeering a. tram. I suppose that to the transport department it is a great crime. It is a great inconvenience and' it is a stupid thing to do, but then the tramways people get over it. In the same way, ' Australia is big enough to realise that this is another act of stupidity by university students. Names have been bandied around and reference has been made to people being charged with treasonable activities. It is said that these persons must be arraigned on these charges. If what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 'McManus</inline> says is true the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> must have had his attention drawn to this a month ago. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> was able to come into possession of these facts about this university club activity; so must the Attorney-General have had these facts. He has been examining them, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus's</inline> argument. Is he not our responsible person in these matters? Why does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> have to go over his head? Does he not trust the Attorney-General? Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> trust the Attorney-General? Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> trust the Attorney-General? There is sufficient legislation on the statute books of this country to put anyone who acts in a treasonable way in gaol for life. As a matter of fact, if the books were to be searched enough it would probably be found that these people could be put against a wall and shot. Yet with all of that legislation to back up the Government no action at all has been taken. The Government is saying, to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus:</inline> 'We will bring in something. We will introduce legislation. We will put the Labor Party on the spot.' The Labor Party is not on the spot at all. We made our position quite clear. We are not associated with the university labour clubs. We disapprove of their actions. - - </para>

                            <para>- No, but I would like the Government to be consistent. It is making a great show .about these few ratbags who want to send something to the National Liberation Front. How will they get it there? Who will hand it over? What form will it take? No one knows anything about that. But on a large scale an important part of our economy is based upon the sending of wheat and wool to China. The Government is so inconsistent about this. </para>

The actions of the students have been described as juvenilia' and I believe that this is a very good description of them. There is no yardstick by which to measure the nonconformity of university students. They will do anything at all. </para>

                            <para>- There are plenty of them who are Liberals. The Government is showing itself up in a very poor light in taking this matter seriously and suggesting that it is a Communist conspiracy. One can stretch the imagination to a certain degree but the Government falls down on the job if it tries to play up into a Communist conspiracy this incident involving juvenile university students. It is running the risk of creating in this country a war fear that can grow out of all proportion. Then anyone who dissents, anyone who expresses an opinion that is against the Government's policy, anyone who may feel that he has a conscience about this wicked war, can come under the surveillance of the Security organisation. It has happened before. Hitler did it and Stalin did it. It can happen wherever one sees fear that can come from what one can almost call a guilty conscience. I believe that this Government and many people throughout Australia and the United States have guilty consciences about this whole thing. I believe that that is why they are so sensitive about it and are taking this matter so seriously. They know' that they have been sucked into something that is immoral and they are trying to find excuses and trying to bluster their way out of it. </para>

It is a matter for great regret that in this great young country - a democracy which gives to its people unlimited freedom and liberty - we have elements in the community which are willing and prepared to serve the; interests of those who are opposed to this; country and who are at present engaged in killing Australian soldiers. It is hard to understand why such people, who make such loud claims about our democratic system of government, are so slow to recognise that the privilege of living within the boundaries of this great democracy has accompanying obligations and responsibilities. </para>

Yet there are those amongst us who are prepared to betray Australia and its interests. We have people who are not prepared to recognise a democratically elected government. </para>

                            <para>-  1 am happy with that relationship; very happy indeed. I am quite content with it. But I say very definitely that people who claim liberty and freedom must also recognise their obligations. Last November the people elected this Government to control the affairs of Australia. The Government was elected with an overwhelming majority. The people gave the Government their approval for the programme it had undertaken in South East Asia. The people gave the Government a mandate to pursue its programme in the interests of the suppressed people of South Vietnam. Yet a section of our people say: To hell with the Government, to hell with patriotism and to hell with the Australian soldiers who are fighting and dying in the interests of this country'. </para>

                    <para>It is said that we should take no notice of these people; that we should allow their actions to pass as incidents perpetrated by some irresponsible students at a university. That attitude seems to me to be the same as saying: 'Don't touch them or you will make martyrs of them'. This discussion in this Senate today was prompted by the fact that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> and I felt that our reaction to these people was the same as that of every decent Australian. This course was taken for the purpose of galvanising the Government into action. It is true that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> made a statement on this matter today. He should have made his statement three weeks ago instead of waiting until the day that this urgency motion was proposed. The only statement I have seen in connection with this incident was one by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairhall)</inline> which was reported in, I think, the Brisbane 'Telegraph' of 26th July. I think that the Prime Minister should have made a statement indicating that this was intolerable conduct which would not be tolerated by the Government of this country. </para>

                        was fair enough to say at the outset of his speech that this Labor Club which we are discussing was not affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. I have listened to speeches made in this place by members of the Labor Party today and each and every  speaker  has said: We do not condone this action'. But not one of them has said that they will stop it or help to stop it, and that is the important thing. Not one of them said that the Government should do something to stop it and that they would aid the Government in this respect. I have waited in vain for a declaration along these lines from the Labor Party but none has been forthcoming.

                            <para>- The honourable senator knows more about them than I do. I am not familiar with them. Therefore 1 might be excused for giving them the wrong title. Although the members of the Labor Party want to divorce themselves from these clubs now, you know as well as I do, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that the people who have been involved in this matter are the same people who took part in demonstrations and' conducted campaigns during the visit of Air Vice-Marshal Ky. You know also that they were encouraged and prompted in their demonstrations by no less a person than the then Leader of the' Opposition in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Calwell.</inline> They were supported also by some of the people who have spoken here today. Is it any wonder that they carry on as they are doing when they have the example set for them by such people? 1 was not present and did not hear the addresses to which I have referred, but 1 am sure that at least they were not addresses requesting these people to act responsibly as young people in a grand democracy that is giving them a great deal more than the young people in most other countries are enjoying. These young people are aiding the enemy who has already been responsible for killing 134 Australian soldiers and wounding 645 others, making a total of 779 casualties. They have the effrontery and the cheek to seek to justify the collection of funds to aid the very people who have carried out this campaign of terrorism against their fellows in Vietnam because they will not submit to Communist rule. lt is interesting to note that in Canada recently gifts for Hanoi were seized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at a border crossing forty miles south of Montreal. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police seized parcels which were destined for Vietnam and sent by American pacifists who had been refused export permits by the United States Government. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Therefore it is fair, is it not, to expect that the Australian Government should recognise an obligation and responsibility to the people of this country, particularly those whom they have conscripted to fight in Vietnam? I am sure that the Government will not be recreant to its trust and its obligation and that although it has delayed doing anything so far, it will now take some 'action. I trust that the Attorney-General's Department will not evade its responsibility on mere technical grounds. If the existing law is not adequate to meet the position let us follow <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt's</inline> example and introduce new legislation to meet it. </para>

                        <para>- When the debate opened, the matter under discussion was the Government's inaction in connection with the activities of certain students at the Monash University. As the discussion developed, the Vietnam situation became the major issue and the Australian Labor Party became the main target. I propose to deal with both those subjects. Let me deal first with the request by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> that action be taken under the Crimes Act. After hearing the speeches by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty,</inline> both of whom are senior members of the Cabinet, and the synthetic support those gentlemen gave to the accusations made in which no dates , or anything else were stated, one might have expected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> to reply to those speeches. He did not take advantage of this opportunity. This, to my mind, is indicative df how insincere he is. </para>

                            <para>- My conscience will stand examination. I do not know whether the honourable senator's will. Let me return to the subject under discussion. lt would be a sorry day indeed if, in a moment of passion, some extreme action Were taken under the Crimes Act. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> of the fact , that history has proved that the action taken at one time against an honourable member for Kalgoorlie was harsh. I do not intend to canvass that incident any further, but I think it will be agreed that the Commonwealth Parliament went a little too far on that occasion. Let me deal now with the student organisations. We are living in an age of demonstration; people prefer to demonstrate about Vietnam. I remind the Senate that during the last State election campaign in New South Wales the meeting at which the then Labor Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Renshaw,</inline> opened his campaign was disrupted by young Liberals. I do not complain about that. That is part of the development that is taking place. </para>

                    <para>There have been many references' to what various Labor men have said at different times. Here it might be interesting to refer to an article in 'International Newsweek Review' which contains a statement by 'that maverick of the Liberal Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes. I do not question <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid's</inline> right to make these statements, but nobody  will convince me that some of his utterances about Rhodesia are not completely out of lune with everything for which the British Commonwealth of Nations stands. I do not object to his having the views he expresses, but 1 emphasise that no member of the Labor Party ever claims that the views expressed by him represent the views of the Government. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the Labor Parly's attitude on this particular issue. The members of the Labor Party have no apology to offer for the reservations they have about the Government's attitude on Vietnam. Reference has been made to the last election. T refer honourable senators to statements published in 'Time' magazine over the last twelve months wherein <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fulbright,</inline> MOnsignor Fulton Sheen and other people have argued that it is time further negotia-  tions for peace were entered into. I mention also that anyone who carefully examines the Labor Party's policy will admit that we stand for the de-escalation of the war. I also point out that during his last visit to Saigon, Defence Secretary McNamara 'asked why there were not more South Vietnamese in the Army. The thing I regret is that Australian and American soldiers are in fact fighting for the South Vietnamese. As any missionary will agree, a society of prostitution and food racketeering has developed up there. I want to see a better society created. Just as towards the end of World War II we saw the Beveridge scheme for Britain, and a host of other plans, so I would like to see plans for a better society in Vietnam. But we cannot have this better society there unless we can provide more effective economic assistance than is being provided now. </para>
                    <para>I say in all sincerity to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> that I would be much happier if I could be satisfied that every time an Australian battalion went to Vietnam it. was helping to create a new and better society.  What I object to are the merchant groups  who are fattening on this war and for whom Australians are. giving their lives. I do not think it is unpatriotic for the Labor. Party to ask whether we are really having enough say in the overall prosecution of the war. I would be very much happier, and I think the Government would too, if the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hasluck)</inline> were to say that we are not doing enough to create a better society and that perhaps we should review our policy. We would find very quickly that . Air Vice-Marshal Ky would execute a few more of these merchants living off the blood pf Australians. That is what the merchant class , is doing and the Government knows it. The Government knows that prostitution and food racketeering are taking place. What is the Australian Government doing about this state of affairs? lt should threaten certain reductions in aid if a better society is not established. This is something that is worrying a number of Australians of all denominations. </para>
                    <para>There is no need for me to recapitulate what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has said about some of these student groups. After all, we find lunatics of the right as well as lunatics of the left. If  a war situation developed tomorrow,' the first thing that the Government would do would be to ask senior members of. the Australian Labor Party to join it in a coalition party, the same as was done in -.1940. That is what the then Government did. The American nation today - and  I  regret this - has had to face incidents such as those which recently occurred in Detroit because of the cessation of civil aid. It is regrettable that these and other city problems have arisen. These have been due largely to a siphoning off of economic resources outside America and that situation in miniature form can develop in relation to housing and other things here. I emphasise the word 'miniature'. I do not like to laud it over the Government but the Government knows in its own heart that every time the Minister for External Affairs comes back from overseas he says: We have turned the corner in South Vietnam'. We have not turned the corner. The Government knows it. The same thing happened during World War II. The Government backed Chamberlain up to a stage. When Churchill took over, the Government had to jettison its ideas. When  President  Johnson makes a change regarding certain things the Government will have to get on side. Again, I do not laud the situation to the Government, but this is history. </para>
                    <para>However, I do say this to the Government in conclusion: No party has a monopoly on patriotism. I think that the vindication of the attitude of the Australian Labor Party, if we want to put it that way, can be found in the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> as Attorney-General did not take seventytwo hours to do the thing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> suggested. Probably, the issues were different. But it amazes me that the mover of this resolution did not direct' his action at the Government, as he might have been excused for doing, but directed it at the Opposition. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I move: </para>

                        <para>- by leave - In 1962 the River Murray Commission investigated a proposal to construct a dam on the Murray at Chowilla with a capacity of approximately5m acre feet. Its investigations showed that without this dam all States bordering the Murray would be subject to water restrictions in drought periods but that the construction of Chowilla would result in a very considerable reduction in the frequency and severity of these restrictions. The estimated cost of the dam was $28m and the Commonwealth Government and the Governments' of the States of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria - who all would be contributing equally to the cost - gave their approval to proceed with the project. </para>

The estimated cost at that time was $43m. On receipt of tenders in April 1967 it became apparent to the Commission that the actual cost of the dam would be in the vicinity of$70m. In view of this greatly increased cost the Commission decided to reassess the. benefits to be gained from Chowilla, taking into account the changes in basic data and operating procedures that had occurred since 1962. </para>

                    <para>Is it not your view that, if the telephones of senators, in particular those telephones within Parliament House or in the Commonwealth offices, are being tapped by any person or organisation, there is a breach of the privileges and rights of senators? If you do agree, will you inquire whether this is being done? If it is being done, will you take appropriate steps to protect the rights of senators and to prevent the practice of which I have complained occurring in the future? </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I reply that the interception of telephone communications is strictly controlled by the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960. From my inquiries it appears that the Parliament purposely did not make any exception in favour of the telephone services of members of the Parliament, and I doubt whether any action taken under the legislation in respect of communications passing over the telephone service of a senator would constitute a breach of the privileges of the Senate. The further matters mentioned by the honourable senator, therefore, do not arise for comment. </para>

                    <para>On 18th May this year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> asked me during question time in the Senate what forward planning was being done by the Department of Supply to preserve for the Commonwealth Service the skills of the many hundreds of highly trained scientists and technicians working at Salisbury and Woomera. This question was asked at a time when there were many rumours of a lessening of work from overseas for the Woomera Rocket Range. At that time the Government was renegotiating the Joint Project, which is the agreement between Australia and Britain in relation to the operation of certain resources of the Weapons Research Establishment, including the Woomera Rocket Range. The Senate is aware that this United KingdomAustralia Joint Project has been conducted for more than 20 years in accordance with a series of partnership arrangements. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased to announce that the two governments have confirmed their intentions to continue this partnership in the Project. The detailed arrangements to apply for the current financial year will be the same as have applied since 1962. The arrangements to apply beyond June 1968 will be discussed early next year, but the negotiations will be on the basis that the partnership relationship will continue for several years. As I advised the Senate previously, the current project work load, which extends to 1970, is heavier than has applied in the last year or two. </para>
                    <para>The Senate may be interested to know that only last weekend the main body of a joint service trial unit arrived by charter aircraft in South Australia to join advance elements already there. The unit is to carry out at Salisbury and Woomera a service evaluation of the Rapier low level air defence guided weapon system developed by the British Aircraft Corporation for the United Kingdom Ministries of Technology and Defence. About half of the strength of the trial unit is from the British Army, a quarter from the Royal Air Force and a quarter from the Australian Army. </para>
                    <para>The members of the Australian Army have been in Britain for about 6 months receiving advanced technological training at various British establishments and field training with other elements of the unit. The unit and contractors' support team, together with their families, will make an addition of some 200 people to the Salisbury and Woomera areas. The arrival of the Rapier trial team follows an established pattern in which British service teams carry out evaluation trials of British developed weapons systems at the Weapons Research Establishment. </para>

                        <para>- by leave - The following ministerial statement was made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> in another place today. Where the first person personal pronoun is used it, refers to the Treasurer. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I informed the House on 11th May last that the Government was examining the question of life insurance and other matters affecting the fighting Services and that the decisions reached would be announced in the Budget. Honourable members will recall the suggestions which have been made that a government sponsored life insurance scheme should be introduced. Generally this proposal has been advanced in the context of the benefits available to servicemen arising from war service and has frequently been associated with claims that there are double standards in assessing compensation; that is, a superior standard in common law and an inferior one for war service. , </para>
                    <para>There are difficulties, of course, in comparing repatriation benefits, which provide pensions and a wide range of other assistance, with lump sum awards; but I suggest that such comparisons as have been made are not supported by an adequate 'survey of the facts. I have had some calculations made of the present capital values of repatriation -pensions and allowances. The amounts are substantial. They range' up to about $15,000 for a married general rate war pensioner, without children, whose disability does not in fact preclude him from working though it may well reduce his earning capacity and prospects. In the ca£e of a married pensioner, without children, who is totally and permanently incapacitated, the amounts range beyond $50,000. I :should emphasise that these calculations take no account whatever of the repatriation benefits payable in respect of children, 'non-cash' benefits such as medical and hospital treatment - which could represent a considerable sum over the life of the beneficiary - or the increases in rates and values of benefits certain to occur over the beneficiary's lifetime. </para>
                    <para>A case where a serviceman who was injured, rendered quadriplegic, and was awarded §82,000- actually $81,055 - at common law has been referred to on many occasions as indicating in itself a need to review the level of repatriation benefits. That award included over $11,000 for loss of wages and hospital and medical expenses incurred prior the court's award. </para>
                    <para class="block">As the soldier injured in Vietnam is kept on full pay and provided with all medical treatment by the Army until repatriation benefits commence, the amount for comparison with repatriation benefits would be $70,000. On a conservative estimate, the present value of repatriation benefits, if payable in this particular case, would have exceeded $70,000. </para>
                    <para>The Government has carefully reviewed the benefits provided under repatriation arrangements, which include a comprehensive system of compensatory pensions, medical treatment and related benefits, and a wide range of other assistance. We have concluded that the arrangements are working effectively and that they make appropriate provision for those who suffer incapacity due to war service and for the dependants of those whose deaths are caused by war service. </para>
                    <para>So far as personal life insurance is concerned, I have previously informed the House of advice received from the life offices that they will insure a permanent serviceman or national serviceman at normal premiums up to the date he is actually posted for service overseas in a battle zone or combat area. As stated by the former Prime Minister on 30th November 1965, there is, however, no uniformity of practice regarding the type of policy which may be obtained or the maximum sum which may be insured. Some companies will only issue endowment insurance contracts under which the sum insured is payable at the end of a fixed term of years or on prior death; other companies have no restrictions on these aspects. During World War II it was customary for war clauses to be inserted in new policies issued during the continuance of that conflict. Frequently, however, the limitations imposed by such clauses could be reduced or removed by payment of an extra premium at a rate varying with the risks involved. During the 1950's, similar conditions applied in the case of servicemen who were under notice of posting to Korea or Malaya and the position is substantially the same today in the case of servicemen proceeding to South Vietnam. </para>
                    <para>The matter of life insurance for servicemen has been examined on several occasions and the Government of the day has concluded that having regard to Australian conditions, adequate provision was made under legislation to meet the immediate and future needs of dependants of personnel killed on active service. After further close examination, we are satisfied that this conclusion remains valid today and we have therefore decided against the introduction of a Government sponsored life insurance scheme. </para>
                    <para>The Government has decided, however, as I announced in the Budget Speech, to seek an amendment of the legislation governing defence forces retirement benefits to admit to the benefits of the scheme certain categories of servicemen who are now excluded because they are enlisted for periods of less than six years. This extension of the scheme will give cover to national servicemen, who are enlisted for two years. If any of these servicemen now to be covered is discharged through invalidity or dies, he or his widow and children will receive the same pensions or other benefits as permanent members of the forces. On normal discharge, they will receive a refund of contributions. </para>
                    <para>As I pointed out in the Budget Speech, servicemen are, in addition, covered by the repatriation legislation whilst serving in special areas such as Vietnam. Thus, for example, a married private soldier totally and permanently incapacitated as a result of war service will receive a pension of $31.50 per week under the defence forces retirement benefits legislation, together with a basic tax-free pension of $34.55 per week under the repatriation legislation. In addition, of course, further repatriation benefits are provided in respect of children and by way of medical and hospital treatment. The details of the extension of the defence forces retirement benefits scheme are now being settled and the legislation will be introduced as early as possible. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to inhibit the activities of the so-called 'pirate' stations that may be established beyond the territorial waters of Australia, but close enough to the coastline to direct their programmes to Australia. Broadcasters of the type we are considering are indeed 'pirate' in that they operate outside the law and make unauthorised use of radio frequencies. By international agreement, the assignment of radio frequencies in each country is controlled by a Government licensing authority which, in the case of Australia, is the Post Office. Uncontrolled use of frequencies, as in the case of 'pirate' stations, represents a challenge to the lawful control of radiocommunications generally, including broadcasting, and such uncontrolled use can upset the good order essential to ensure that a service is available to the thousands of lawful users, free from interference. Lawful uses of radiocommunic.ation services include not only authorised sound broadcasts and television but also such essential services as air and marine navigation- aids, police services, fire protection services and other important uses. </para>
                    <para>The radio frequency spectrum 'is public property and the public is entitled to feel assured that adequate control of its use is being exercised. The spectrum is extremely congested due, particularly, to the growth of new' needs in recent years. For example, a multiplicity of new frequency requirements has been created by the developments in space exploration and space satellite communications. The assignment and use of frequencies cannot' be undertaken lightheartedly, lt is a complex' matter which requires careful study to ensure that all services operate with a minimum of interference. This objective can only be achieved by giving expert attention to the proper technical standards and characteristics of equipment to be used. </para>
                    <para>Radio waves do not respect national boundaries and. it has therefore been necessary to set up a good deal of regulatory control of r'adiocommunication on an international level. Australia is a signatory to the International Telecommunications Convention and the associated Radio Regulations which lay down the broad principles to be followed by countries, their obligations and the use to which particular frequencies may be put. One regulation, "in fact, specifi cally prohibits the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on ships, while another lays down that no transmitter may be established or operated without due authorisation from the government of the country concerned. Thus, special coordination arrangements are necessary to ensure that frequency assignments made to1 individual stations do not give rise to interference to other services. This objective cannot be met if individual private interests are permitted ro select a frequency at random without a complete knowledge of the characteristics of the other services in use. </para>
                    <para>Unlike some overseas countries, 'pirate' broadcasting "has not previously been a serious problem- in Australia. Our well established dual system of national and commercial broadcasting provides an adequate base on which to develop the service needs of the community, and the very existence of a commercial service removes iti once the most powerful reason for setting up a pirate station. Over the lest few years there have been several abortive attempts to establish unauthorised transmitters- off our coast, more recently in the Gold Coast area. Following a -public inquiry, and report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, a licence was issued for a broadcasting station in that area. There were' suggestions that an attempt would be made- to establish another transmitter to service the sarin: area, from a ship outside territorial- waters. Since these  amending legislation proposals were introduced in another place, the threatened pirate operations in the Gold Coast area have not eventuated. Nevertheless, the need for effective control over frequency usage has not diminished,- and it is- desirable that the legislation seeking to outlaw pirate broadcasting- activity still proceed. </para>
                    <para>Clause 4 of the Bill proposes that; it shall be an offence to establish, maintain or operate a transmitter" for unauthorised broadcasting purposes from a ship in waters adjacent to' Australia. It will also be an offence to' give' any assistance or tq rentier any services- for the operation of the ship or the transmitter. In order that "the new provisions may be adequately enforced, clause 5 extends the jurisdiction  of  the several courts of the- States and Territories to cover offences- arising from :the foregoing activities. I should 'point' but that the Bill is, by far, less comprehensive than the legislation which it has been necessary to introduce in other countries, for example, Britain. In spite of this, however, it is expected that the Bill will be adequate to deal with any pirate radio situation likely to arise in the Australian environment. Needless to say, the matter will be kept under close study, and the Government is prepared to consider more comprehensive measures if necessary. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to obtain the approval of Parliament to an agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia for the provision of financial assistance to the State towards financing the construction of a pipeline to carry natural gas to Adelaide from the GidgealpaMoomba region in the north east of the State. </para>
                    <para>Some few months ago, the South Australian Government approached the Commonwealth Government for assistance in respect of difficulties the State was experiencing in obtaining finance for a natural gas pipeline from the newly discovered fields at Gidgealpa-Moomba to Adelaide. The cost of construction of the pipeline was estimated' at $35m. The State Government declared its intention of setting up a semi governmental statutory body to construct and operate the pipeline, but faced a difficult financing problem in bringing the project to fruition over a comparatively short term of years from normal sources of semi-governmental finance. The State Government considered that it would not be possible for the pipeline authority to raise any more than $20m during the period of construction and decided to approach the Loan Council for permission to borrow that amount. The Commonwealth was happy to support the application to the Loan Council. </para>
                    <para>At its meeting in February last the Loan Council agreed to the South Australian Government's request for approval of borrowings in respect of the pipeline up to $20m during the period ending 30th June 1972, such borrowings to be additional to the normal South Australian semi governmental programme. The Loan Council also agreed that borrowings under this special authority could, if desired, commence during the 1966-67 financial year. To bridge the gap between these borrowings and the estimated cost of construction, the Commonwealth indicated that it would be prepared to lend the State during the construction period such additional sums, up to a maximum of $15m, as may be needed to complete the project in accordance with the construction timetable. A condition of the Commonwealth's offer is that the State accepts responsibility for financing any short fall in semi-governmental borrowings over the period to 30th June 1972, below the figure of $20m, and also for financing any increase in actual construction costs above the estimate of $35m. </para>
                    <para>Agreement has now been reached between the Commonwealth and State Governments on the terms and conditions on which the assistance is to be provided. The loans made by the Commonwealth to the State will be repayable half-yearly over a period of eight years, the first instalment falling due on 15th December 1972 and the last instalment on 15th June 1980. The sources of funds for repayment of the Commonwealth loans will, of course, be a matter for the State. We expect, however, that these will include the normal South Australian semi-governmental borrowing programme and receipts by the pipeline authority from its operations. </para>
                    <para>The agreement provides that interest on the Commonwealth loans to be made to the State will be payable half-yearly on 15th June and 15th December at the maximum rate authorised by the Loan Council at the date each loan is made for private borrowings by semi-governmental authorities for a period of eight years. The agreement </para>
                    <para>Includes the standard provisions relating to such matters as advance payments to the State and the supplying of audited information about expenditure. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I should like to say that the Commonwealth Government is happy to be able to provide South Australia with the assistance necessary to allow this project to go forward without delay. We accept the State's views as to its technical soundness and as to the contribution it is expected to make to the development of the State's economy generally. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

No reason has been advanced by the Minister who proposed this motion to justify the Senate not sitting tomorrow. We have had a very long recess interrupted on one day for an important matter of Senate business. During the recess there has been an accumulation of many public affairs which need attention by the Senate. Why should we come here on Tuesday, hear the Budget Speech read, sit on Wednesday and then not sit on Thursday when there is a great deal of work to be done? </para>

                        <para>- It is only customary because it ..is calculated to give to the Opposition, the alternative government, ah opportunity to study and evaluate the most important document in the fiscal policy and the management of the Commonwealth of Australia. I should have thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> leading the Opposition as he does in the Senate, would have been grateful for the opportunity to have an adjournment tonight which would not envisage a sifting of the Senate tomorrow, so that he could do his homework and be more competent and more capable of putting the Opposition point of view in relation to the Budget when it is debated here next week. 1 have made second reading speeches on two Bills which will ,enable us to have Government business to attend to when we ' come back here on Tuesday next. The honourable senator rattled off with great gusto all of the items on the business paper. We all know that the Senate rose on 19th May, apart from the, extraordinary meeting that we had in June. We all know  -  it is a pity that those who are listening in do. not appreciate it-that, whenever a matter is put down, for the purpose of convenience, anyone who -may Want to speak is given an opportunity - to take the adjournment of the debate. The honourable senator mentioned a whole series of matters which, if we had had a proroguing of the Parliament, would have been removed from the business paper altogether. I do not think there was any validity in the argument he produced in relation to the various matters that are found on the notice paper. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> suggested, the Leader of the Opposition was in fact being quite consciously grossly unfair to the members of the Senate, not only to Government supporters, members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and the independent senators, but also to his own supporters, in the assumption that when this place rises their work ceases. </para>

                        <para>- He said it clearly by inference, as anybody could hear. The inference was clear that when the Senate rises as a result of the decision that is about to be made everybody will pack up and go off on holidays. The suggestion that the period before we came here was a holiday was grossly improper. Who will acknowledge that from May until now he has been on holidays? I do not know what the honourable senator does when the Senate is not sitting. I know what Government supporters do. I know what I have done in terms of work, both as a backbencher and as a Minister. Most frequently one works a jolly sight harder when we are not in session than when we are in session. Today we heard great talk from the Leader of the Opposition about liberties, yet he comes here tonight and absolutely degrades the character and performance of honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. I think he ought to be ashamed of himself. </para>
