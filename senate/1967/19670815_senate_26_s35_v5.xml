          <para>- On behalf of the Opposition I express sincere regret at the passing of George Henry Gray, member for Capricornia. He was a humanitarian with deep and sincere convictions which were demonstrated in his extensive involvement in public affairs. He was born on 2nd October 1908 at Orange in New South Wales and was educated at public schools and at the University of Sydney. Later he distinguished himself by study in agriculture and commerce. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Commerce and of several other professional institutes. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>From 1930 to 1939 he was a farmer in Queensland. Soon after the outbreak of war he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces and served in New Guinea, attaining the rank of captain. He served as Secretary of the North Queensland Canegrowers Association from 1951 to 1954, and from 1955 to 1962 he was Secretary of the Rockhampton Agriculture Society. He was a director of the Rockhampton Co-operative Housing Society, and for six years until 1965 was  Chairman  of the Queensland Bush Children's Health Scheme. He belonged to many other bodies, in all of which he served with honour and dignity.  His  interests were varied. He had strong ideas on the social credit economic theory. He was recognised as Australia's most accomplished exponent of the case against the fluoridation of water. </para>
        <para>George Gray joined the Australian Labor Party thirty-four years ago. He became a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Capricornia in 1961. In the Parliamentary Labor Party he was held in high esteem, and at the time of his death he was secretary of the Party's northern development committee. His earlier interest in defence matters was manifested during his parliamentary service. He was secretary of the Opposition's defence committee and recently he designed and built a prototype tank, which he offered to the Australian Army. </para>
        <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gray</inline> was a devoted family man, was respected in his community and was active in his church. He was an elder of the Presbyterian Church and an active member of its public questions committee. I knew him and had great affection for him. To his widow and family I extend the deep sympathy of all members of the Opposition, who join with me in supporting the motion proposed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I wish to associate the Australian Country Party with the remarks that have been made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition. I was very pleased indeed to look upon George Gray as a friend. We have heard the previous speakers tell of the deeds of this man, not only in war but also in peace. He served his country well in war and, as we have heard, in time of peace. He was obviously possessed of a sense of civic responsibility and he discharged that responsibility in a very worthy and very able manner. It is quite obvious that not only is the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia a loser by the passing of George Gray but so also is the Commonwealth of Australia itself. To his sorrowing wife and family I extend very sincere sympathy. </para>

        <para>Tonight, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1967-68. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. </para>
        <para>First 1 want to speak briefly about our recent economic experience, take stock of the economy at the moment, and then say something about our prospects. </para>
        <para>A  year ago, the effects of drought were still lingering, consumer spending was sluggish, and private capital expenditure seemed to be slowing down. For these reasons, last year's Budget was designed to be expansionary. </para>
        <para>The economy responded much as we intended. The year 1966-67 was one of strong and varied growth. On the demand side, public authority expenditure led the way. With a much better season, rural output and incomes both increased notably. Consumer spending also revived. While building and construction for commerce and industry and private spending on plant and machinery tended to fall away, there was a considerable lift in dwelling construction. </para>
        <para>For 1966-67 as a whole, gross national product rose by 9%. After making full allowance for price increases, there was an increase of between 5% and 6% in national production in real terms. This achievement was close to the best of recent years. </para>
        <para>The number in employment in 1966-67 was 2.5% greater than in the year before. This was a smaller increase than has been usual. The lower migrant inflow has been a factor in the smaller rise in civilian employment. </para>
        <para>Domestically, therefore, supply and demand seem to have been pretty much in balance. </para>
        <para>Wage rates have increased strongly: over the year to June, minimum weekly wage rates rose by about 7%. As to prices, the consumer price index rose in the first three quarters of 1966-67 at an annual rate only a little above <inline font-style="italic">2%.</inline> However, in the most recent quarter, the rise approached an annual rate of 5%. </para>
        <para>Externally, results have been mixed. Taken as a whole, the export performance over the past year has been splendid - the best we have ever had. Imports increased little as compared with- 1965-66, though the rate was rising in the later months of 1966-67. The substantial trade deficit in the preceding year thus gave place to a useful surplus of $95m. With defence and civil aid and other payments abroad increasing, the net deficit on invisible payments widened and net receipts of capital from abroad fell a long way from the record level of 1965-66. In the outcome there was a loss of $177m in external reserves. The offsetting increase in our drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the credit extended to New Zealand reduced the net adverse movement io $125m. </para>

        <title>THE BUDGET AND THE ECONOMY</title>
        <page.no>6</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>The Budget provides for total expenditure in 1967-68 of $6,483m and total revenues and similar receipts of $5,887m. Thus the estimated gap to be financed from borrowings of various kinds is $596m. This would be $61m more than the amount borrowed last year. </para>
      <para>On these figures, expenditures will be $561m or 9.5% greater than those of last year - when the increase over the previous year was 11%. The increase in revenue will be $499m - or 9.3%: last year it was $309m or 6% . </para>
      <para>These aggregates of expenditures and receipts reflect our judgment as to the kind of Budget the economy needs to keep it healthy during the year and beyond. </para>
      <para>As we now see the prospect, we can expect another, good year. The supply of labour, material and plant is adequate to sustain a good rate of growth. With normal additions to the work force from our own population and net immigration, a rise of 3% in employment seems feasible with out putting much strain on the labour market. lt would be normal to expect some further gain in overall productivity. The capacity for expansion is certainly there. </para>
      <para>The rural industries will depend, as always, very much on seasonal conditions. For some major districts a good season is not assured as yet. Given a good season greater production will certainly be achieved. </para>
      <para>On the side of demand there arc also grounds for confidence. </para>
      <para>Consumer spending has been growing strongly and we can expect this trend to continue. Employment is bound to go on rising and so are average earnings. Generally, conditions seem set. not for a boom, but for a good steady expansion of consumer demand. </para>
      <para>Let us now consider the prospects for the other main segment of private^ spending, that is, capita! expenditure. Expenditure on dwelling construction has been increasing steadily. The flow of finance appears to be keeping up. If anything, the year ahead might see some further increase in dwelling construction. An increase In non-residential construction also seems likely. </para>
      <para>Increased consumer spending can be expected to make heavier demands on production and hence on plant capacity. Various big projects associated with minerals, oil and gas are in train. Bank lending and unused overdraft limits are high and monetary liquidity is adequate to support a substantial increase in business expenditure. All told, therefore, the indications are that private capital expenditure in general will gather impetus as the year goes on. </para>
      <para>Let us turn now to public authority expenditure. The allocation of resources between the public and private sectors was the crucial question we faced when framing the Budget. </para>
      <para>There is scope in the economy for production to rise at much the same rate as last year. Total expenditure also could increase about as fast as production without upsetting the balance of demand and supply. Consumer spending has revived and we expect private Capital expenditure also to do so. There could obviously be trouble if, at the same time, public spending were allowed to continue to rise at the rate of the past few years. We could quickly find ourselves overspending, with resources over-stretched, prices rising fast and a heavy external deficit. </para>
      <para>The Government does not want to take the risk that these conditions will emerge. Already rising wage rates have created a cost problem worrying for all; serious for the exporting industries and acute in the case of some sections of the wool industry. Externally our position is und;r some stress. It could become difficult if an excessive rise of demand led to a strong upsurge of imports. </para>
      <para>While we keep the progress of the economy sure and steady, our balance of payments can be manageable. Our export prospects are certainly good and, in particular, the big mining developments now under way or imminent will add increasingly to our earnings abroad. On the other side of the ledger, we expect imports to increase. Additionally, we face some big external commitments in the period immediately ahead, especially for defence. Capital inflow is unpredictable. Allowing for a rate of inflow comparable with that of 1966-67, some further loss of external reserves is likely in this financial year. We do not want that loss to be aggravated by an over-stimulated demand for imports. </para>
      <para>On a balancing of these probabilities, we do not think it would be in the nation's interests to put further restraints on consumption. The taxes imposed in 1964-65 and 1965-66 in order to shift resources to defence are still effective and new restraints could immobilise rather than divert resources. </para>
      <para>Equally, however, we do not think that consumption expenditure needs any stimulus now. The tasks to be done and the demands to be made on resources are too numerous and heavy for us to be able to afford too strong an increase in consumer spending. </para>
      <para>Nor do we wish to depress private capital expenditure. Some of it might not pass the test of high national priority but the private sector is responsible for the largest part of production and has, therefore, a critical role to play in national growth and progress. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>One reason why we have drawn the reins on public spending more tightly than, before is to provide room for balanced expansion of the private sector. For some years now the public sector has been setting the pace and doing so strongly. That it should have done so is in part based on historical need: that is, the need for large and rapid defence expansion coinciding with unparalleled demands for works to serve great new developments and improve facilities for education, transport, power and fuel supply - in a word, to establish the foundations for larger economic growth. </para>
      <para>To recognise these necessities does not mean, however, that the requirements of the public sector must over-ride everything else. Essentially, this involves the problem of choice and allocation of resources. Pressed hard by competing claims, we had to decide what the broad allocation of resources should be. As I said earlier, the private sector has a major part to play in growth. It also has a major role to play in national security since basically defence must be built upon the growth of our manpower, our industrial capacity and our ability to pay our way abroad. </para>

      <para class="block">These are the reasons why we have made a strong effort this year to bring the increase in expenditure within tighter limits. The goal we set was 9%  and within the practical limits set by our commitments for defence, we have gone close to achieving it. I shall now explain what we propose in respect of the main expenditure groups. </para>

          <page.no>7</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Again this year defence commitments have been a dominant element !in the Budget. Last year, expenditure was $950m. This was 27% above expenditure in the previous year. </para>
        <para>This year we are providing $l,U8m for defence - an increase of $l68m or 18% on 1966-67. </para>
        <para>May I recall that in 1962-63, five years ago, our defence bill was $428m, nearly $700m less than the estimate for this year. Over the four intervening years the rate of increase has averaged 22% per year. </para>
        <para>We have accomplished this expansion without serious distortion or disruption of our domestic economy. We have done it through fiscal and monetary means without the direct controls associated with a proclaimed state of war. Lest anyone should suppose that it has all been costless, let him reflect how much could have been done if all those additional expenditures and the resources they represent had gone into the enlargement of our industrial capacity and other basic facilities for growth. </para>
        <para>It is not, however, the present level of defence spending so much as the rate of escalation that concerns us most. Plainly we cannot continue for long to meet anything like the rate of increase of recent years without deep impairment of the economy. As it is, estimated defence costs this year will be equivalent to 5% of what we think gross national product is likely to be, calculated at factor cost. Among the countries of the Western World, only the United States, Britain and France are at present devoting a larger proportion of their resources to defence than we are. </para>
        <para>Total defence expenditure is one aspect of the problem: our mounting external costs of defence are another and more serious aspect. Five years ago, our external costs of defence were well under $100m a year. This year they could rise above $350m. At this level they would represent 1 1 % or more of our export earnings. Some of this expenditure will be met from credits arranged abroad but, though helpful in spreading payments, credits simply carry the liabilities forward. Even so the net cash outgo this year will be well above $200m. </para>
        <para>Defence must, and does, rank high in our national priorities. We must be prepared to play an effective role in our own defence and, in co-operation with our Allies, in the security and stability of this part of the world. Our effectiveness will grow as our resources develop, but we would not be helping either ourselves or our Allies were we to attempt to overreach our capacity. Defence subtracts from the resources available for growth. </para>
        <para class="block">DEFENCE FORCES RETIREMENT BENEFITS </para>
        <para>We propose to seek an amendment of the legislation governing the Defence Forces </para>
        <para class="block">Retirement Benefits to give common entitlements to all servicemen on full-time continuous duty for periods of twelve months or more by admitting to the benefits of the scheme those now excluded because they are enlisted for periods of less than six years. </para>
        <para>This extension of the scheme will give cover to National Servicemen, who are enlisted for two years. If any of the servicemen now to be covered is discharged through invalidity or dies, he or his widow and children will receive the same pensions or other benefits as permanent members of the Forces. </para>
        <para>While serving in special areas such as Vietnam, servicemen are, in addition, covered by the Repatriation legislation. Thus, for example, a married private soldier totally and permanently incapacitated as a result of war service will receive a pension of $31.50 per week under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits legislation, together with a basic pension of $34.55 per week under the Repatriation legislation. Additional Repatriation benefits are, of course, provided in respect of children and by way of medical and hospital treatment. </para>

      <para>The scale of our economic aid to developing countries is not as well known as it should be. Unlike other aid-giving countries, we give all our official aid in grants, not in repayable, interest-bearing loans, tied or untied. Our official aid this year, estimated at $142m, will probably represent about 0.75% of our estimated national income. Only France among the countries of the West can point to a better performance than that. Australia's aid, moreover, has grown rapidly in recent years whereas that of other donor countries has been static or declining. </para>
      <para>This year, our expenditure under bilateral and multilateral aid programmes will increase by ?9m to $50m - that is by 23%. The main increases will occur in our contribution to the International Development Association and in emergency assistance for Indonesia. The amount of $5.2m for Indonesia is special assistance over and above normal Colombo Plan aid to that country. We are providing $9.5m in anticipation of the coming into effect of food aid obligations under the International Grains Agreement. A gift of 150,000 tons of wheat to India, valued at nearly $9m, has already been arranged. </para>
      <para>Defence aid of some $6m will be given to Malaysia and Singapore. </para>
      <para>The grant to the Administration of Papua and New Guinea will increase this year by almost $8m to $77.6m - that is, by 11%. The Administration intends to provide additional capital for the Papua-New Guinea Development Bank, which has now started operations. If through the year the Bank's requirements seem likely to exceed its resources, we shall consider adding enough to the grant to permit the Bank's needs to be met. Over and above the grant, Commonwealth Departments will incur in the Territory expenditures of an aid character amounting to about $14m. </para>
      <para>In all of this aid-giving we clearly recognise our obligation to help the needier people of the world. We do this, knowing that the transfer of resources to others must subtract from our own resources and especially our external resources. These are anything but unlimited. </para>

      <para>On the other hand we have not felt that general reductions in taxation are needed. We are therefore leaving the general level of taxation unchanged. What we have done is to survey the whole field of taxation in order to ensure that, as far as it was financially practicable, we would provide concessions wherever we felt there was  a  real need and benefits could and should be given, especially for those with family responsibilities. 1 shall now explain these concessions. </para>

      <para>The allowances for maintenance of dependants have remained unchanged since the financial year 1957-58 and in that time their value to taxpayers with families has diminished a good deal. We have decided to increase the allowances by $26 a year. The increase will apply over the whole range of these allowances. To give some examples, the allowance for a wife will be increased from $286 to $312, for one child under sixteen years from $182 to $208, and for other children under sixteen years from $130 to $156. </para>
      <para>The higher allowances will apply in assessments based on income of the current income year 1967-68. For salary and wage earners they will be taken into account in reduced tax instalment deductions expected to come into operation on or about 1st October next. </para>

      <para class="block">In the last two Budgets temporary measures were adopted for wool-growers who were forced by drought to advance shearing dates and shear their sheep twice in the one year.

An alternative method of accounting for the proceeds is proposed in relation to sales in the 1967-68 income year and subsequent years. Under this proposal, a primary producer may elect that the profits of a forced sale be applied to reduce the value of replacement stock for taxation purposes. The broad effects of an election will be to defer tax on the profits until the stock has been replaced and sales are made in the normal course of business. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>During 1967-68, the expected higher level of business activity and of housing development will place increasingly heavy demands on the Post Office. </para>
        <para>The Post Office also faces the problem of rising costs in running its services. It continues to install the latest technical equipment and to improve operating methods and techniques. By these means, productivity has been steadily improved, as is shown by the fact that business done has increased faster than staff numbers. For example, between 1959 and 1966 the postal staff increased by 10% but handled 31% more traffic. By their nature, however, the services provided by the Post Office require a lot of labour and labour costs have gone on rising. This year it is estimated that Post Office wage and salary costs will rise by more than $19m. Of this increase, over $13m is due to the increases awarded in the National Wage Cases and other recent arbitration decisions, including the full year cost of the Interim Margins Award. When higher prices for materials used and other cost increases are also brought to account, the Post Office will be headed for a loss of over $40m in this financial year if charges are not increased as proposed. Financing a loss of this order would pose a serious budgetary problem. Without the estimated increase in revenue of $36m to be obtained from the higher charges, the net call of the Post Office on the Budget this year would, it is estimated, rise from $l81m to $2 17m. There has been no general increase in postal tariffs, or in telephone local call fee and trunk charges, since 1959. </para>
        <para>With one or two minor exceptions, the increases in charges now proposed are the same as those put before Parliament towards the end of the last financial year. They are to operate from 1st October next. The adjustments proposed are expected to yield in 1967-68 an additional sum of $36m in Post Office revenue, or $17m less than if they had been introduced from 1st July as originally planned. They will yield $64m in a full year. </para>
        <para>Other changes of an accounting and procedural kind are proposed to help the Post Office operate as a business undertaking. The Post Office is required to conduct its operations in accordance with the best business practice. The Government is convinced that this objective would be better served if the financial machinery of the Post Office were changed from the standard Treasury and Departmental system to a commercial form more suited to business requirements. After a thorough study the Government has decided to create a Post Office Trust Account into which Post Office revenues will be paid and from which its expenditures will be met. The Department's net requirements for capital purposes each year will be provided annually under one-line appropriations from the Budget and paid to the Trust Account. </para>
        <para>The Department will thus operate its own trading account, but will remain subject to the control of the Postmaster-General and, of course, of Parliament. The new arrangements will, in fact, give Parliament greater opportunities to examine the affairs of the Post Office. Its commercial accounts and annual report will, as now, be tabled in Parliament each year. An innovation will be the tabling at Budget time in Parliament of a White Paper giving estimates of commercial results and expectations, the proposed capital programme, together with the way it is to be financed, and other information on Post Office affairs. </para>
        <para>Further information concerning the proposed new financial arrangements will be given shortly and legislation will be introduced during the current financial year with the objective of having the new administrative arrangements operate from 1st July 1968. </para>
        <para>While it has important national obligations to meet, the Post Office should earn sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs over a period of years. It is reasonable also that its earnings as a business undertaking should make some contribution towards the expansion of the telecommunications network. Some retention of profit for capital purposes is standard business practice. Against this background the Government decided to increase Post Office charges. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In accordance with the policy of progressively recovering from the air transport industry a greater proportion of the large and increasing cost' of providing, maintaining and operating airports and airway facilities, the Government has decided to increase by 10% the rates of air navigation charges payable by all aircraft operators. These increases will take effect from 1st January 1968 and are estimated to bring in $257,000 additional income in 1967-68 and $893,000 in a full year. </para>
        <para>The rates of air navigation charges have been increased by 10% in each of the last five years. Despite this, the gap between the amount that it costs the Commonwealth annually to provide aviation facilities for the industry, and the amount of revenue received annually from the industry for the use of these facilities, has continued to widen. Thus general taxpayers, rather than the aviation industry and the users of air services, are required to meet the cost of these facilities to an increasing extent. The Government has decided that additional measures are necessary if this trend is to be arrested and {further progress made towards the objective of requiring commercial aviation to meet an increasing share of the cost of facilities provided for it at public expense and properly attributable to it. </para>
        <para>It has therefore been decided, in addition to increasing air navigation charges, to introduce a passenger service charge which will be payable by passengers on both domestic and international air serservices. Details of the scheme will be announced at an appropriate time by the Minister for Civil Aviation. Legislation to give effect to it will be introduced during the current financial year. The charge will be calculated to yield revenue of Between $4m and $5m a year at present traffic levels. </para>

      <para class="block">1 said earlier that estimated expenditures of $6,483m will exceed estimated receipts of $5,887m by $596m. This amount will have to be covered by net borrowings at home and abroad. </para>
      <para>Part of the borrowing requirement arising will be met by net drawings on the credit arrangements for defence purchases in the United States - this year estimated at $123m compared with last year's $91m. That will leave $473m to be borrowed from other sources. The comparable figure in 1966-67 was rather less at $444m. </para>
      <para>We will continue to borrow abroad on acceptable terms but it would be a delusion to suppose that great sums can readily be borrowed overseas. </para>
      <para>So far as our borrowing prospects abroad can be assessed, we would expect redemptions again to exceed new loan proceeds although to a smaller extent than last year when the excess was $82m. The amount then remaining to be covered by net borrowings in Australia should not exceed the net $527m borrowed locally last year. </para>
      <para>We cannot estimate with any accuracy how much of the amount to be raised locally will come from the Australian public. We shall aim at raising as much as we can from that source. We can be sure that a considerable amount will come directly or indirectly from the banking system. In all probability, some borrowing from the Reserve Bank will be necessary- The substantial direct payments abroad financed from the Budget will, however, have offsetting monetary effects. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>We cannot measure precisely either the monetary effects or the economic impact of the Budget. What we can do to assist interpretation is to break down the estimates into economic categories. </para>
      <para>Expressed in the national accounts form, in which form they are comparable with the national accounting statistics for the economy as a whole, the estimates indicate that total Budget outlay will this year increase by 10% compared with an increase of nearly 12% last year. T\his outlay includes direct payments abroad. Mainly because of defence commitments, these external payments are estimated to rise to S652m or $147m more than last year. </para>
      <para>Outlay within Australia is estimated at $5.554m and will exceed estimated receipts by only a small margin. Receipts include an estimated $330m of revenue which is expected to result from the growth of incomes and economic activity. This revenue being itself the consequence of the economic expansion expected this year will not have offsetting effects on those Budget outlays that add to incomes and spending in Australia. </para>
      <para>We are confident that the effects of this Budget, combined with the steady rise in private spending for both consumption and investment, will keep the economy growing at a healthy rate and will keep resources fully employed. The Budget will help us achieve our central aim, which is to strengthen the economy and give greater scope for private spending. </para>
      <para>As the year goes on, the Government will as always be ready to meet particular needs or eventualities. Monetary policy can and will be used as necessary to help keep the economy on the right course. </para>
      <para>In our view businessmen can wilh confidence make plans with the expectation that the economy will continue to grow steadily. Indeed, if we all plan in this way our expectations are the more likely to be realised. </para>
      <para>Even the most cautious amongst us can scarcely fail to be confident of the future of this country. Vast new discoveries of resources are becoming almost a commonplace. In this recent phase, each discovery has inspired further effort and further effort has led to new discoveries. </para>
      <para>As far ahead as we can see Australia has all the potentialities for sustained growth and we in Australia are in truth making creditable efforts ourselves. </para>
      <para>These efforts together with these great natural resources are the source and foundation of growth. </para>
      <para>There are, too, other pre-conditions of growth we cannot afford to neglect and there are many questions we should ask. Our workforce is growing and gaining in competence. Is it growing fast enough for all the tasks now crowding upon us? Management has a critically important task to fulfil. Is management everywhere doing the job national greatness demands? Are we mobilising the capital we are accumulating and allocating it to the right uses? Are we sufficiently conscious of the critical necessity to control costs of production? Are we efficient? To ask these and other questions is not to belittle the achievements of those who are in fact finding the answers to our problems. They simply remind us that if the opportunities that lie before us are great, the efforts they demand are equally great too. </para>

I desire to draw the attention of the Government to the acute state of poverty that exists among a section of our Australian community. In my opinion, the Government is unrealistic in not recognising this fact. The Government praises itself for its achievements in respect of the economic growth and wealth of the country. That acute poverty should remain unobserved amid such wealth would be an indictment of any government. If no redress is to be given to the sufferers in times when we are appropriating money for other purposes, the stage will be reached when revolution or industrial action will be needed to obtain justice for some 800,000 people who are living below the subsistence level in Australia at the present time. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>today outside Parliament House 1 attended a meeting of representatives of pensioners from practically all States of the Commonwealth. After this meeting, I spoke with some of these people privately. I heard of the cases that they have brought forward and of the conditions under which they are living. I heard of people who are receiving an insufficient rent allowance to enable them to meet the demands of a hungry landlord and of those who have mortgages on their homes or who arc renting properties but are not receiving a rent allowance. I heard of the burden of water rates, land taxes and sewerage charges that are levied on these people each year. It is well nigh impossible for them to meet those costs. Some councils, actuated by a spirit of benevolence, allow rates and taxes to accumulate and be a charge upon the estate of the owner of a property at the time of his or . her death. Therefore these people who possibly came into the world in debt leave it in debt also. This is because we are not providing sufficient to enable them to have a reasonable standard of living in our present supposedly prosperous economy. </para>
          <para>Many of the matters that were discussed with me today were discussed also in a television session on Channel 2. Good, respectable women who appeared on that programme discussed their approaches to the problem. They told how they cannot afford to buy the food that they desire to eat. They are restricted to a meagre diet. They can rarely go out and cannot have any amusement other than the amusement that was shown on the television programme which they make in the community for themselves. They cannot buy new clothes, especially the clothes with which we know women like to adorn themselves from time to time. This is the state in which we find a section of our community today. </para>
          <para>This matter possibly is not thought to be important by some political parties as it is not considered that increased social welfare is an election winner. Someone, invariably raises the question of who will pay for increased pensions. While this situation arises from time to time, a stage in the degradation and oppression of these sections must be reached where an uprising will take place in the community and the possibility of an electoral victory Will be lost by the Government because it has not met the changing conditions of the times and given these people a reward comparable with what they were receiving some years ago. The value of the £, or the $, has been destroyed and what these people receive today by way of pension has not the same value as it had in the past. We have moseys to pay for overseas ventures to stop some forces of independence, but we have not money to pay to these deserving Australian citizens. Possibly some of these people are relatives of ours. There may be among them the parents of some honourable senators on the Opposition side, if not on the Government side. Those people are living in poverty. </para>

              <para>-  I am fully aware that when my Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> speaks on the Budget he will speak about its inadequacies. Today I attended a meeting at which the pensioners' case regarding poverty was put up. If the matter I am discussing had been included in the Budget, I would have been unable to discuss it tonight. I am discussing something outside the Budget. </para>

              <para>-Order! The matter raised by the honourable senator would be discussed more appropriately during the Budget debate than  on  the motion for the adjournment of the Senate. </para>
