I apologise for the lateness in distributing copies of the amendment, but the fax machines have not been operating this morning. The amendment seeks to take a large chunk out of the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline> and put it in the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The items that we are taking out of the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill are clauses 1 to 2 and 4 to 8. These clauses go to the taxation treatment of co-contributions. Essentially, the amendment ensures that the co-contributions of low-income earners are tax-free and that the tax treatment of co-contributions is fixed up. The Democrats have every intention of insisting on our amendment to the consequential amendments bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other two key elements of the consequential amendments bill are the abolition of the low-income earners rebate, which is worth around $10 million a year, and a series of minor amendments dealing with the payment system of co-contributions to various schemes. We would certainly hope that those matters are dealt with and resolved by the government and us before the end of the financial year when they would need to be in place. We felt that the most important item, in terms of benefit to low-income people, in the consequential amendments bill was the tax treatment of co-contributions. Senator Sherry asked several questions about this topic earlier on in the committee stage. If we are to insist on the amendment to that bill, I think it is essential that we resolve clearly beyond doubt that the co-contributions will in fact be treated as tax-free in the hands of superannuation funds. The amendments which I will be moving to the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 deal with that issue.</para><para>If these amendments are passed by the chamberâand I do hope they areâthen it would be our intention not to insist on the Labor Party amendment to the surcharge rate reduction bill. The reason for that is that we believe the amendments we have moved to the consequential amendments bill are superior. It is worth noting for the record that the amendments which Labor has moved to the surcharge rate reduction bill are identical to the earlier draft of the amendments which the Democrats had circulated and moved to the consequential amendments bill. Subsequent to that, when Labor moved identical amendments to the surcharge rate reduction bill, we revised our amendments to the consequential amendments bill to pick up the issue of interdependent relationships. As a result, the chamber now has before it two sets of amendments dealing with this issue. One is the same sex couple amendment, moved by Senator Sherry, which the Democrats supported and which we drafted. The second is a broader definition which we have put into the consequential amendments bill, which deals both with same sex relationships and interdependent relationships. </para><para>Further, the amendments which we have moved to the consequential amendments bill go not just to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act but also to the Income Tax Assessment Act. In many respects, amendments to the consequential amendments bill are superior to those moved to the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003. By allowing the surcharge rate reduction bill to pass, we are delivering on a very large chunk of the package, which we have agreed to with the government, and by attaching this amendment we ensure that the co-contributions bill will in fact be able to operate as intended as a tax-free payment to superannuation funds. From that point of view, I commend this amendment to the chamber, and I await people's response to it.

I am pleased that Senator Boswell is here because I want to deal with a couple of remarks that The Nationals have made. Firstly, I will deal with the new amendment to the first bill that we are to vote on resulting from the message from the House of Representatives. I remind those thousands of people who may be listening to this debate on broadcast that the first bill we are dealing with is the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. The effect of this bill, if it were passed, would be to deliver an exclusive tax cut on the superannuation of high income earnersâthat is, Australians earning more than approximately $96,000.</para></talk.start><para>The intention, if this message from the government is accepted, is to deliver an exclusive tax cut to the superannuation of high-income earners only. The Labor Party does not agree with an exclusive tax cut to the superannuation of high-income earners. It is an important point of principle and fairness. There would be some puzzlement, some bemusement, amongst Labor Party supporters and members if we were to come into the chamber and support an exclusive tax cut to the superannuation of high-income earners, particularly as the number of high-income earners who would benefit would be five per cent or less of the Australian work force. </para><para>It is not a surprising position for the Liberal Party to put; they are here to represent high-income earners. Labor has put an alternative proposal, which is to reduce the current 15 per cent tax rate that applies to most Australian superannuationâ8Â½ million income earnersâto reduce their superannuation tax burden. I remind the chamber that since the election of the Liberal government in 1996, the total tax contribution collected on superannuation has risen from about $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion to approximately $5.3 billion, which it was in the last financial year. So we have seen a huge increase in the tax slug on Australian superannuation since the election of a Liberal government. In fact, the biggest increase in government tax revenue is coming from workers' superannuation. That has a very clear impact. If you tax workers' superannuation, you reduce the final outcome because for every dollar of tax you reduce final retirement incomes and superannuation by $4 to $5. So Labor does not agree with reducing this tax burden only for those earning more than $96,000. That is not the Labor way and Labor will not support it.  </para><para>We had a bit of a homily from Senator Boswell. It might have been his first speech on superannuation on the last occasion when we were debating this matter. Senator Boswell had basically two themes when he spoke on behalf of the National Party. First, he attacked the Labor Party for not representing the workers of Australia. I reject that because here is the Labor Party refusing to support an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners, and putting a fairer alternative to reduce the general tax rate on superannuation. </para><para>I addressed a meeting of about 25 or 30 shearers in Tasmania on the weekend before the recent contribution by Senator Boswell. They asked about the taxation of superannuation. I explained to them that the Liberal-National Party was supporting a tax cutâbut only for those earning more than $96,000. The shearers, the workers, said to me: `Where is our tax cut? We do not earn $96,000.' They were outraged. Here we have an example of the Liberal-National Party displaying its true coloursâproposing to reduce the tax on superannuation, but only for high-income earners. If this message is passed by the chamber and this tax reduction exclusively for high-income earners comes into effect, I look forward to Senator Boswell defending an exclusive tax cut and excluding the 8Â½ million Australians who earn less than $96,000. </para><para>The second theme of Senator Boswell's contribution on behalf of the National Party went to the successful amendment that removes discrimination with respect to same sex couples. If we vote to uphold the message, then the successful Labor amendment that removes discrimination in respect of same sex couples will be defeated. Senator Boswell made it very clear in his contribution that the National Party is fiercely opposed to removing the discrimination in respect of same sex couples and the treatment of their superannuation. </para><para>From a Labor point of view it is a basic issue of social justice that the current discrimination that applies to same sex couples in respect of their superannuation should be removed. I challenge the National Party to justify why government, why the state, should interfere with personal property rights. In Australia, superannuation belongs to the individual citizen. It is their legal property. Therefore, why should government or the state in any way interfere in the personal arrangements of an individual who seeks to leave their superannuation to whomever they likeâmember of a same sex couple, sister, brother, mother, whatever? Why should government interfere in property rights in this country? We do not, except in respect of superannuation. If a person in a same sex couple has a house or other property we do not interfere in their right to leave that asset, unimpeded, to their same sex partner. Yet we do it in respect of superannuation. The National Party is arguing to maintain interference by the state, the government, in the property rights of individual Australians. It is done in the name of defending traditional marriageâthat was Senator Boswell's justificationâbut that is simply not the issue. </para><para>This bill is not about recognising same sex marriages, as Senator Boswell attempted to argue. It is about removing a clear discrimination in respect of the property rights of individual Australians. Individual Australians have the right to leave their property to whomever they want. We discussed in great detail the sorts of problems same sex couples have in respect of the treatment of their superannuation should they die. I do not intend to go through those issues today. That is why the Labor Party on a previous occasion successfully amended this billâto remove the discrimination in respect of same sex couples. </para><para>We have a further amendment from Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens with respect to the co-contribution and we have another amendment from the Democrats on the consequential amendments bill. That brings me to the new amendment of the Australian Democrats. I recognise reality. I recognise that the Democrats are going to vote down Labor's same sex couple amendment, in all probability. We have not had the vote yet but I recognise that that is likely to happen. Nevertheless, the Labor Party will press its amendment. We believe it is appropriate to insist on removal of same sex couple discrimination with respect to the superannuation surcharge rate reduction bill. We believe that that is the correct approach. </para><para>With respect to the new Democrat amendments moved today on this billâSenator Cherry did me the courtesy of ringing me earlier todayâthe Labor Party will support the Democrat amendments on this rate reduction bill. What I find fascinating, though, is that my understanding of these amendments, should they pass, is that there will be some extra cost to governmentâI am not sure of the amount. I will be interested to see whether or not the government regard these Democrat amendments as a breach of the signed-up deal they have with the Australian Democrats on the bills that we are considering. I will be interested to see whether Senator Coonan on behalf of the government regards them as a breach of that deal. </para><para>I suspect that here Senator Cherry is trying to have a bit both ways. There is a bit of a problem with the same sex couple amendments and not supporting them, and the writing is on the wall at least for Labor's amendment, and Senator Brown's too, I suspect. But Senator Cherry wants to preserve his position on the consequential amendments bill with respect to same sex couples, which Labor will support. If that is carried, that would then allow the surcharge tax rate reduction bill and the low-income earners co-contribution bill, which we will get to next, to pass without disruption, subject to the latest amendments that the Democrats have moved.</para><para>Senator Greig made on a previous occasion a couple of comments that I briefly want to respond to. He accused the Labor Partyâthese are not the exact wordsâof indicating that it would not move a same sex couple amendment to the surcharge rate reduction bill and said that I had indicated that I would move this amendment to the so-called superannuation choice bill. I did indicate I would move it to the superannuation choice bill, but at that time we did not have a Democrat package, we did not have a Democrat deal. We did not have this bill we are currently considering and the next one to amend and we were not likely to have them, because the Democrats did not have a deal with the government. The Democrats came along and did a GST type deal with the government on the superannuation bills and therefore we have to address them, and the first opportunity we have on appropriate legislation we are presented with here today. I stress `appropriate legislation' because the Labor Party in the past, as the Democrats have continually reminded me, has not always supported same sex couple amendments in respect of superannuation legislation. That is true. We look at appropriate legislation to amend in this chamber. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âDid you tell the shearers?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âWe look at the best means to accomplish the goal, Senator Boswell, and the Labor Party has not been in the habit in the past of holding up what it considers to be worthwhile changes to the superannuation system and attaching a same sex couple amendment to remove the discrimination, knowing full well that we will have a blank refusal from the government and a worthwhile measure in respect of superannuation would therefore not pass. But I make it very clear that the Labor Party does not support this exclusive tax cut in respect of superannuation. We do not support it; that is not our position. We will deal with the co-contributions for low-income earners next. The Labor Party does support that bill, but it is the government's choice to link the two together. This government has linked the two together quite deliberatelyâin our view, the good with the bad. But that does not mean we are going to abrogate our principle of fairness in respect of tax reductions and support an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I had two other comments to make, but I think I will make them on the next bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>16736</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is a relatively modest amendment to advantage low-income people involved in what the Democrats are moving with regard to the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, but it does not escape my notice that the real gain is to give away the lever that there is to insist that the package come accompanied with an end to discrimination against same sex couplesâpartners or people living in any sort of relationship: mother-daughter or any sort of dependent relationshipâwho want to have their superannuation go on to that person who is effectively their next of kin. There is a big lever because the government wants this package to go through. The Greens, the Labor Party and the Democrats have moved amendments which attach to all three bills to insist that that discrimination end in superannuation across the board, with minor exceptions, including the parliamentary superannuation scheme. But what has been worked out over the last two weeks, when the Democrats have said they were going to leave the vote on this to put pressure on the government, is that the pressure, as I thought, has effectively worked on the Democrats and they have come up with an alternative scheme which is easier for the government to live with but without pressing for the end of discrimination.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Cherry very kindly explained it to me again. There is a $10 million penalty on the government if the government does not pass the third bill, the consequential amendments bill, and if it does not agree to the end of discrimination in superannuation. Gee! In a budget of hundreds of billions of dollars a year, the Democrats are threatening $10 million if the government again turns down this move by the Senate to end discrimination in superannuation. It is a sell-out. Of course the government can live with that. On behalf of the Greens, I cannot support the rearrangement going on here, because it really is saying to the government, `You get your package,' and it is the Democrats saying, `We tried very hard with superannuation. The government only had to cave in on the third and minor bill and we would have been there, but they're not doing it, the brutes.' The fact is that the Democrats are giving away the leverage where they should have stood, eyeballed the government and said, `If you want this package through, do the decent thing and end discrimination on superannuation amongst Australians.' Do not have the situation where a mother can hand her superannuation on without penalty to her husband but, if he is long gone, not to her son or daughter. If people are married, they can hand on superannuation without penalty, but if they happen to be same sex couples they get a very big taxation penalty imposed on the superannuation and there is not an ironclad guarantee that the superannuation goes to the partner anyway; it can be disputed. </para><para>We have had that debateâI am not going to cover it againâbut I am not going to agree to a series of amendments, no matter what the sweetener, which sells out on this long campaign by the Democrats and Greens to get rid of discrimination in superannuation. At last, Labor have come on board and said they are moving to end this discrimination. They have brought their own amendments in here, along with the amendments of the Greens and Democrats. It has presented the Democrats with a difficult situation. They had a package agreed with the government and suddenly the Greens, the Labor Party and then the Democrats themselves added amendments to get rid of the discrimination in this particular piece of legislation. There has been a lot of work done over the last two weeks to try to get out of that fix, resulting in the prescription we have had today. I am not going to support it, and the Greens will not support it, because we believe the government should be changing the law to end this discrimination. The chamber has the power to do that. The government will back down if we stand our ground, but it only takes one component of this chamberâthe Labor Party, the Greens or the Democratsâto back off and this stand against discrimination is lost. In this proposal, the Democrats are backing off and giving the government an out. They say, `The penalty is $10 million a year,' but that is a penalty the government would easily wear.</para><para>It would be interesting to know from Senator Coonan what the government thinks in response to this. If Senator Coonan gets up and says, `Yes, we will accept all three bills,' I will be first across to my colleagues on my left, the Democrats, to shake their hands. But I do not think that is what is happening here at all. In fact, I think the Democrats are saying they have made some minor adjustments to this legislation in a way in which the government will essentially be able to get its package through while continuing its wall of discrimination in superannuation against people who do not happen to be in a heterosexual relationship, in an age where the Australian community has moved way beyond that. I will be interested to hear the rest of the debate, but I can tell you very firmly that the Greens will not be conceding on the antidiscrimination component by having it all put into the consequential amendments bill so that the government effectively gets its package through unscathed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>16737</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe saw from Senator Brown last week that he is more interested in headlines than in getting the truth out, and that contribution was simply another indication of that. This amendment is trying to ensure significant extra gains for low-income earners. Senator Brown is not interested in extra gains for low-income earners, because he would rather score political points using the gay and lesbian community as his sacrificial lamb. He has indicated that he is voting against this amendment seeking to ensure more money for low-income earners. That is his decision, but do not let him try to hide that by saying that he is standing up for gay and lesbian people while doing that. What he is doing is selling out low-income earners.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Cherry made it quite clear when he moved the amendment that the Democrats are insisting on same sex amendments, yet Senator Brown wishes to portray that as somehow being the Democrats selling out. For over two decades, the clear intention of the Democrats has beenâyou could not get a stronger, clearer or more consistent recordâto explore every opportunity for removing discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. We have had some successes, but we still have some way to go. </para><para>Senator Brown is also wrong in saying that this chamber has the power to remove this discrimination. We do not; otherwise, we would have done so. Certainly in this case, where the majority of the chamber has indicated it wants to remove this discrimination, we are insisting on that, but we do not have that power in our own right. That can occur only if the government agrees. Clearly, the government to date has not indicated that it will agree. I suspect you could block supply in this place and the government still would not agree on removing discrimination against gays and lesbiansânot that the Democrats are advocating that, because we are not a party that believes in acting irresponsibly in the parliamentary system. </para><para>We are clearly indicating here that we are insisting again on removing discrimination against same sex couples. This is only one area of discrimination, it must be said. There is a wide range of areas of discrimination elsewhere, which the Democrats have also consistently sought to address. I can understand it if Senator Brown or the Labor Party do not like this package. That is fine, let them say that, but do not let them use the gay and lesbian community as some sort of pawn to cover up the fact that they are simply trying to sink a package they do not like. That is a fundamentally dishonest approach to an important issue.</para><para>As we have clearly indicated, the Democrats are still trying not only to get the benefits for low-income earnersâif Senator Brown does not want those benefits to go to low-income earners, that is for him to justify, but the Democrats doâbut at the same time to see if we can move forward on the issue of discrimination against same sex couples and people in interdependent relationships. We are continuing to explore those avenues. Others may wish to simply exit from the whole issue and use it for political point scoring; we will simply focus on trying to get some positive gains for the gay and lesbian community. That is what we are continuing to do in both this amendment today and our approach, which we have already outlined, in insisting on the amendments that are part of the broader package of messages that we have to consider.</para><para>Let us get rid, once and for all, of this furphy that somehow or other the Senate can make this happen of its own will and all we have to do is keep insisting. We are continuing to insist. The Democrats have been insisting for decades but, unfortunately, we have not been able to make it happen because of intransigence, particularly on the part of this government, although this superannuation act under which the discrimination exists is part of the previous government. The situation here today is quite clear. Senator Cherry has outlined his reasons for this amendment. It is all part of what has been a consistent approach from the Democrats on this issueânot just with this package of bills but indeed for many yearsâof trying to explore every opportunity to remove some of the discrimination against gay and lesbian people and people in interdependent relationships whilst also seeing if we can get gains for the broader community.</para><para>That is what this bill and this package is about, and that is what the Democrats will continue to pursue. Let us at least have a debate based on some truth. As I said, we have already seen that Senator Brown is more interested in headlines and stunts than the truth, but the Democrats will take a different approach, as we always have and will continue to do so, because we are interested in results before headlines. That is the approach we are taking here, and that is the approach that we will continue to take. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>16739</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to point out that I do not oppose the improvements for low-income earners. What I oppose is the Democrats not insisting on the amendments that end discrimination. Let us be very clear about that. There is a second package being brought here by the Democrats which says, `We're going to cover the backdown on the end of discrimination in superannuation because we've got a package here which is going to give some advantages to low-income earners.' I say: get the advantages for the low-income earners but do not back down on the amendments to the first two pieces of legislation. When the division comes and the Democrats do not insist on the amendments the chamber has made to those bills, that is the end of the combined strength of this chamber to determine that the discrimination should go and that the government has to back down on that.</para></talk.start><para>There is no way you can get around that. What is happening here is quite clear. I do not care what Senator Bartlett says in his analysisâthat is for him. What I am concerned about are real people who have a real opportunity to have the discrimination against them ended here and the Democrats not standing up to the government on it. That is why we will be insisting on these amendments. Sure, give the advantages to low-income peopleâthe Greens are very strong on thatâbut do not use it as a cover to get around the sell-out that is occurring here in ending discrimination.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>16739</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust to make Labor's position clear in respect of the latest amendments from the Democrats, whilst we will be supporting these amendments, we will not be supporting the government's message. There will be two separate votes. By supporting the government's message, we will be removing the amendments successfully moved by the Labor Party on this billâsupported by the Democrats and Senator Brown on a previous occasionâto remove the discrimination in respect of same sex couples.</para></talk.start><para>I largely agree with Senator Brown. If the cost is $10 millionâand we have not heard from the government yet about whether they are supporting these amendments from the Democratsâthat is small change in the context of a budget of more than $100 billion in expenditure and in the context of the Liberal government being given cover by the Democrats to slide away from dealing with the issue of ending discrimination with respect to same sex couples. For the government and The Nationals, led in this chamber by Senator Boswellânow nicely lit up in the sunâ$10 million, in this case at least, is a small price to pay for not dealing with the issue of discrimination in respect of same sex couples. I find it a bit extraordinary, frankly, but for them it is a small price to pay for their ideological obsession not to front up to this issue of removing discrimination in respect of same sex couples.</para><para>Senator Bartlett has been in this debate on a number of occasions. It is interesting that he has been dashing in and out to make a contribution. Senator Bartlett accused Senator Brown of chasing headlines. For any politician to say that politicians do not chase headlines is, I think, just a touch unfair. Everyone chases headlines at some point in their political career. I want to highlight to the chamber that, on this particular package, I have never seen such an attempt by the Democrats to chase headlinesâexcept on the GST deal. I have all the press clippings here, including Senator John Cherry's press release, and I have transcripts of his media appearances. In fact, when he hatched this deal and put it together, he got more publicity than Senator Coonan. So let us not say that the Democrats are so pure that they do not chase headlinesâthey doâand the bills we are discussing are a good example of Senator Cherry chasing headlines to promote the deal that he did with the government. </para><para>Senator Bartlett did talk about making gains in broader packages and discussions. I do not necessarily agree with the Democrats and the deals they reach. We have not heard from Senator Cherry on this. I think it was Senator Wong who went to the heart of the challenge to Senator Cherry when she asked him whether he on behalf of the Democrats even raised in his negotiations with the government the issue of same sex couples. Did he raise it? Did he even attempt to remove the discrimination against same sex couples when he dashed in, did his deal to get the headlines and agreed with the government and came to a compromise on this package? We have not had a response.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>âWe raised it in the business tax package.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âWe are not dealing with business tax today, Senator Cherry. Let's call a spade a spade: I think you were so interested in chasing a headline, in getting a deal on behalf of the Democrats and yourselfâand we know the challenges the Democrats faceâyou forgot about same sex couples on this occasion when you carried out those negotiations. There is not even an acceptance in principle that the issue be dealt with. I would have thought that at least you could have got some sort of statement from the government that they would examine the issue. It has been overexamined, in my view, but at least you could have tried to deal with the issue. But there is nothing. There are lots of press releases and headlines for Senator Cherry and the Democrats about the latest GST type deal on super, but where were the get in there boots and all negotiations to at least try to get an outcome on this package? That is what disappoints the Labor Party. At the end of the day, we argue these issues and sometimes we win and sometimes we loseâwe know that in politics there are compromisesâbut where is the guts and all attempt, Senator Cherry, to progress the issue on this package, other than the headline chasing?</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>16740</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to respond to Senator Sherry's contribution and the previous contribution by Senator Brown. There are a couple of things that I want to point out. The Democrats have been moving on this issue for some years. Senator Sherry and Senator Watson would be well aware that in 2000âthree years agoâwe got that close to getting an agreement with the government on the choice of funds legislation, but we refused to cross the Rubicon because of this issue, and choice of funds remains stuck on this issue.</para></talk.start><para>We are the only party in this place that has actually pushed this issue in a legislative sense. Senator Brown accused us of a sell-out and a whole range of other things. When has he moved an amendment in this place on this stuff? When, before this debate? Never has he moved in superannuation to recognise same sex couples before he stood up in this place in a great grandstand and said: `The Democrats have done a deal. I'm going to embarrass them. I'm going to move same sex amendments to it.' That is the first time in seven years in this place that we have seen Senator Brown move an amendment in recognition of same sex couples in this area of superannuation.</para><para>The Greens are so concerned about this issue that Michael Organ did not even vote in the other place to insist on this amendment. Let us remember that. There is a chance here for Senator Brown to embarrass meâand I am happy to accept thatâbut certainly we have got the consistency on the issue. Senator Brown says, `Holding up the consequential amendments bill will not be sufficient.' If the government has to pay a penalty for not being prepared to deal with the issue of interdependency, then it has to pay a penalty. That penalty is that the low-income earners rebateâ$10 million a year every yearâwill not be abolished. And that penalty is paid to low-income people. I quite like that. There is a symmetry in that: if the government is not prepared to fix this issue of interdependency and same sex couple relationships, it has to pay the penalty to low-income people. </para><para>In addition to that, the choice of funds legislation remains stuck, as it has been stuck on this issue in this place because of the insistence of the Democrats for four years. In addition to that, the government is on notice that the issue of its spouse co-contribution billâcoming up later this year and currently before a committeeâis stuck on this issue as well. Those are three things on which the government is now stuck. So the price is rising on these issues.</para><para>I am not prepared to sit here and deny a benefit to low-income people. At the end of the day, you have to actually think through the whole issue of discrimination in superannuation. At the end of the day, there is a large amount of discrimination in superannuationânot just against same sex couples or family relationships, as we discussed with Senator Boswell last time we debated this matter, but also against low-income people because the tax concessions massively benefit high-income people. There is also discrimination against women because of their broken work patterns. These issues have to be dealt with as well.</para><para>If you are interested in superannuation, Senator Brown, then look at the whole picture. Look at the entire issue of superannuation and the tax treatment of superannuation and be consistent about it. The whole thing about this package and the low-income earners rebate is that it removes a lot of the systemic discrimination against low-income people because it gives them a break if they are prepared to save. That is worth doing. Probably the worst area of discrimination in the superannuation system is that it discriminates against low-income people. That is what we are trying to fix with this packageâin an imperfect form, in a first-step form, but in an important form. I do not want to see that jeopardised, which is why I have moved this amendment today.</para><para>By the same token, we have to recognise that there is an issue of discrimination against same sex couples and interdependent relationships, but we also have to put that into perspective. We have to remember that the vast bulk of same sex couples and people in interdependent relationships do in fact get access to superannuation. In fact, the four cases taken to the Superannuation and Complaints Tribunalâand I would encourage Senator Brown to read themâhave been resolved in favour of same sex couples. So we have to put this into perspective. At the end of the day, whilst discrimination exists on paper in the Superannuation Act, the primary discrimination remains in the tax act, and that is what our amendments go to.</para><para>I note for the record, while I am discussing various people's views on this, that I have with me here from the other place Mr Albanese's private member's bill on recognition of same-sex couples' rights. This bill was so inadequate it dealt only with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which is the area where, by and large, people get access to their super. It did not deal with the tax side and it did not deal with the public sector schemes. Senator Sherry said that we have not insisted on these matters in the past; we haveâon choice. We have held that up for four years. In addition, the Labor Party has had dozens and dozens of opportunities to raise this issue in this placeâwhether in relation to a superannuation bill or, more significantly, a tax bill, because that is where the worst discrimination occursâbut it has not actually come through. </para><para>We are saying that we want this package to proceed because it is a good package. It is a very good package. It is a good package for low-income people. Senator Sherry forgets, in accusing me of being a dud negotiator, that in discussions with the government we got $460 million of the surcharge cut moved from high-income people to low-income people, and that took 12 months of discussion, debate and negotiation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âWhat were you doing?

The difficulty with the Labor Party's superannuation policy is they want to move that money back up the scale to middle-income people. They want to take the money off those low-income peopleâwith their two per cent tax cut for everybodyâand give it to middle-income people. I do not support that because, if I had $460 million, I would prefer it to go to the low-income people, to the real battlers, rather than to the middle-income people. And that is what I suppose this debate is about to the Labor Party.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I do want to note for the record that the Labor Party have made a great deal of progress on the issue of recognition of same-sex couples at a state level. I note that, in my own state of Queensland and in fact in all states of Australia, it has been Labor governments that have moved for recognition of those relationships. I note Senator Sherry's comments today in support of these amendmentsâcertainly, for the first time in this placeâand I hope that he will join with me and the Democrats when we deal with the choice of funds legislation and the spouse co-contribution legislation to ensure that this issue is in fact brought up in the appropriate place and in the appropriate bills, and that the government do recognise that parts of their platform are not going to move forward until these issues are dealt with. But, for today, we need to get a message out not only that this package is worth supporting and worth going through but also that the amendments to remove discrimination against those in same-sex and interdependent relationships are worth doing and worth going through, which is why the Democrats will be insisting on our amendments when we come to that debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>16742</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Senate is debating the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. This bill is linked with a co-contribution for low-income earners. I commend the stand taken by the Australian Democrats in recognising the importance of this legislation and not going along with the new-found enthusiasm of the Labor Party for a same-sex couples amendment being linked to superannuation. This seems to be the first time the Labor Party have jumped on this particular bandwagonâand we all know their opposition to reforms by the coalition government, particularly reforms to superannuation.</para></talk.start><para>I remind people listening to this debate that the surcharge was introduced when the coalition came to office and inherited a $10 million deficit. It was felt that it would not last all that long. But, at the first opportunity that we have to reduce or eliminate that surcharge, the oppositionâthe Labor Partyâseek to deny that measure. That denial is against a background, over years, of the Labor Party opposing the surcharge and speaking violently against the surcharge. Why should income earners, whether low or high, pay a higher rate of tax on their superannuation than they do on their ordinary personal income? </para><para>The other big problem with the surcharge is that it is not universally applied. For many people it may only apply once in a lifetime, when they break with their employment and get some add-ons because of their reason for leaving, such as a problem associated with their health as a result of an accident. Their income is artificially lifted on account of that and in association with the termination. They do not get that back. It is a payment that once paid never comes back by way of a rebate or a refund. It is a one-off. </para><para>There is a large sector of the work forceâoften people who are in the emergency servicesâwho find themselves having to get discharged from work because of occupational health problems or accidents and suddenly, for the first time, become subject to the surcharge. It is a tax that not everybody has to pay, because certain state judges are now exempt as a result of a constitutional challenge in the courts. This is a very small step towards reducing the surcharge rate but an important one because it does provide a signal of intent to ultimately get rid of the surcharge when the revenues of this country permit.</para><para>But what are the priorities of the Labor Party? They have suddenly come in very strong about introducing a new notion that has not been in the bill and is not related to the billâa foreign notion, of same-sex couplesâin a bid to defeat the legislation. Where are the Labor Party priorities, when the people who are going to benefit from the co-contribution are the low-income earners?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âWe support that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name></talker><para>âIt is all very well to say you support that, but we support it as a package. There is a package of rate reductions. Obviously it is striking a tender nerve. What they are seeking to do shows that the Labor Party now have the priority of abandoning low-income earners in favour of so-called middle-income earners.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I must remind the Senate that the Democrats are the only party that has had any consistent policy over the years on same-sex couples. The Democrats regard this package of measures as so important that, although they have held up a number of other superannuation bills, they are prepared, after a lot of debate and a lot of negotiation, to get this through because it is going to affect so many important peopleâpeople who, for the first time, are going to get a superannuation amount added to their small holdings.</para><para>I applaud the Democrats for their negotiating skills because I think they have got a good deal. The $460 million transfer of the rate reduction extends the number of people who are going to benefit under co-contributions. There will be a dollar-for-dollar contribution payment into superannuation accounts of people whose incomes are under $27,500, and then it will be on a sliding scale that will phase out between $27,500 and $40,000. It is a very generous deal and shows good negotiating skills. One of the good features of the Senate is that these sorts of things can happen in order to get legislation through and to uphold matters of principle that the Democrats think are important.</para><para>It is important that the surcharge is eliminated over time. This is the first opportunity that we have had of eliminating front-end taxes. Of course, front-end taxes were introduced by the Labor Party. It was a terrible decision. I think everyone in the superannuation industry now recognises that. It was sold on a false premise at the time. There would hardly be a voice in the superannuation industry that is supportive of front-end taxes. The concept is that the taxes should be paid when the benefits are ultimately paid outâthat is, on or approaching retirementânot when the moneys go in. If there are taxes as the money comes in, in terms of a contributions tax, it means that for every $100 investedâfor example, put in by the employer under the superannuation guaranteeâonly 85 per cent gets invested in your account. So there is an awful lot of lost investment earnings because of that reduced capital as a result of what the Labor Party did to superannuation as part of their so-called reforms. </para><para>Why did the Labor Party do that? It was because they were money hungry. They were part of this move to increase the amount of taxes on superannuation. Senator Sherry, it was your party that pioneered this grab for superannuation taxes. It was your party that initiated this change to front-end taxes and effectively brought forward the taxes payable on this from where they were previously paid. It was your party that made this grabâthis unholy grabâfor taxes on superannuation. So do not come here and say you are supporting lower taxes and you are supporting the poor. Your amendments today are not supporting low-income earners; you are not supporting measures to try to get rid of front-end taxes. You are true to all the Keating proposals of keeping that grab for money at the front and not helping those most in need. I commend the measures, I commend the Democrats for agreeing to what I believe are some very important amendments and I thank the minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>16744</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to begin by summarising where I think we are all up to. Basically, we now have an opportunity today either to continue to insist or to work to get through what is a very important measure for low-income Australians. I support Senator Watson in what he has just said with regard to the Democrats, and I would like to congratulate Senator Cherry. They have got a very good arrangement with the government: $460 million transferred from high-income earners to low-income earners. As Senator Watson said, the threshold has been liftedâup to $27,500 it is dollar-for-dollar and up to $40,000 it is on a sliding scale.</para></talk.start><para>Again, we have the government saying with these amendments, `No. The Democrats had an original deal.' The government are going to be pushing the Democrats to stick to that original deal. At best, if this Senate passes the new amendments today, we will have a further delay; at worst, we will simply see these bills go into the great hole that the choice bill seems to have vanished into. As has already been said in this chamber, they have been down that hole for four years now. I do not think even a very extensive excavation is going to get those out, particularly as they also have the same sticking pointâa sticking point that Labor has just discovered.</para><para>Labor have a long-term opposition to the bill, and I understand they are voting against it regardless. I think it rather opportunistic of them to start moving these amendments in the hope that they can embarrass others, cause some disruption and, if not delay, fail in this very important measure for low-income Australians. I would say that Labor are at a bit of mischief making.</para><para>I think we have to look at some of the substantive matters, both the sticking points as well as what is actually in the bill. As Senator John Cherry said this morning, the Democrats want this to go through. I say to Senator Cherry: if you are going to insist on these new amendments, it simply is not going to go anywhere. The government have made that very clear. They want the original agreement, and so it is going to stay back. While I acknowledge what the Democrats are trying to do, it is simply not going to work. So I say to the Democrats: enough is enough; the debate has gone on long enough. </para><para>We are talking in particular about discrimination against women. I remember, going back to when the original superannuation discussions were heldâwhen I was in a different partyâthe Keating government in the 1990s. They were very important changes. The superannuation guarantee laws have, I believe, been of great benefit. But, as the only woman senator remaining on the crossbenches who was there at the time, I have to say that for women, they have not been as good as we hoped. That is for a raft of reasons. Going back through the second reading speech and other comments that have been made, all people acknowledge the issues relating to patterns of employment, women moving in and out of the work force, and also to downright discrimination. We only have to look at first-year-out salaries for university graduates to see that there is consistent and endemic discrimination against women in the work force. Women simply do not share the same access as men in terms of pay, employment, super benefits et cetera.</para><para>As women are overrepresented in the groups, as Senator Watson said, of people with incomes under $27,500 and under $40,000, with this legislation we are trying to help undo some of that discrimination. It is extremely difficult, if you have broken work patterns as well as a low income, to get anything significant put aside for your retirement. A lot of women rely on the superannuation of their partner; unfortunately, we only have to look at the statistics to know how many marriages do not survive. More and more women these days also understand that they have to have their own superannuation funds and make some serious effort to contribute towards them. The dollar-for-dollar benefit and the tapered benefit in this bill are extremely important to them. Let us stop the point scoring; let us get down to work and make sure that we vote today in a way that will see this legislation pass.</para><para>I have to say that I do not, in any way, accept Senator Boswell's arguments for refusing to accept these sensible amendmentsâthey are unjustified. I do not want to go back into the old biblical arguments and try to find where on earth he justifies them but, as a practising Christian, I certainly cannot find any justification for them. But I am not going to go down that road again today; I simply agree with Senator Cherry when he says that, even if we blocked supply, The Nationals would not support this logical, sane and sensible change to both tax law and superannuation law.</para><para>I would like to comment now on the Greens' attitude. I have to give Senator Brown one thing here: he is consistent on this issue. But where is the Greens' consistency in the claims that they represent low-income Australians and care about those who are struggling? You only have to look at the Greens' web site. I had a bit of a look over the last week or so in their section on women in the work force. It says:</para><quote><para>The Australian Greens will work towards:</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>e.	ensuring that women have access to adequate retirement income, including superannuation; and </para><para>f.	ensuring continuation of superannuation during parental leave.</para></quote><para>Here we have the Greens' policy in black and white: `The Greens will work towards ...'. Here is a great chance: in this chamber today we are trying to work towards significant improvements for women, in their working lives, to accrue some superannuation. I note Senator Ursula Stephens's work. She is also, I am sure, very familiar with these issues for women. Before coming into this place, Senator Stephens was deputy chair of the New South Wales Women's Advisory Council. A submission to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, specifically with regard to women and superannuation and submitted on 27 September 1995, said: </para><quote><para>The minimum contribution under the superannuation guarantee legislation was enforced from 14 August 1993. It is expected that lower paid women workers will benefit significantly from the introduction of the super guarantee. During 1992-93, the New South Wales Women's Advisory Council undertook an investigation of issues of access and equity for women in super. The report found that women do not share equal access to men in terms of benefits, due to the gender segregation of the labour market ...</para></quote><para>And it goes on to many of those issues that we have discussed. So the Labor Party is also very well aware what this bill is going to do for low-income Australians if we facilitate its passage through this chamber today.</para><para>I will conclude my remarks by asking to have incorporated into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a little table showing the retirement savings gap by age. It says that men in the 25- to 29-year-old age group need an additional contribution of 2.9 per cent; women's by then need 5.6 per cent. By the time we get to some of the older age groupsâfor example, women who are 50 to 54âwe see that men need to put in just over eight per cent and women need to put in an extra 23 per cent to get to a reasonable level of retirement savings.

NATSEM research on the wealth of older households (still in the workforce) shows higher wealth households hold almost all wealth, including non-superannuation financial assets, and almost all of these households would have been excluded through the upper income limit of twice average earnings. This data on non-superannuation wealth is only reported on a family rather than individual basis, so it could not be directly included in the calculation.</para><para>A note on the nature of this calculation.

In her response, it would be appreciatedâI assume this can be doneâif she could give us the cost to revenue of the latest amendments the Democrats have proposed. We are still debating the message in respect of the tax cut bill. This is an example of what I call the old pea and thimble trick that Senator Cherry and the Democrats have fallen for. I go to Senator Cherry's own background paper, amongst all the other press releases he put out about this deal. It does highlight just how the Democrats have been conned. Senator Cherry and the government keep saying that the cost of the low-income earners co-contribution measure, if they find the $1,000, will be $920 million over four years. Correct. They say the cost for the exclusive tax cut for high-income earners will be $475 million over four years. Correct. On initial analysis it looks as though there is almost double the benefit going to low-income earners through the low-income earners co-contribution compared to the exclusive tax cut for high-income earners. That is what it looks like on a superficial, first-call analysis.</para></talk.start><para>But look at the outcome in the fourth year, 2007-08. Senator Cherry's own background paper shows that the cost to revenue of the exclusive tax cut in 2007-08 is $200 million for high-income earners and that the cost of the co-contribution for low-income earners is estimated to be $215 million. In the fourth year the benefits in this package flow almost equally between the high-income earnersâthose who earn more than $96,000, who get an exclusive tax cutâand the one in 10 low-income earners. Over time this package proportionately benefits higher-income earners through the tax cut surcharge proposal. The Democrats and the government have front-end loaded the co-contribution and back-end loaded the tax cut for the fourth year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>âFrom your two per cent.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âFrom 2007-08 on, I suspectâalthough we do not have the figuresâSenator Cherry, that the benefit to high-income earners will be greater than the benefit to low-income earners.

I predict that in 2008-09 the cost of the exclusive tax cut for high-income earners will be greater than the benefit of the co-contribution for low-income earners. The package will initially have a two to one benefit to those low-income earners who benefit from the co-contribution. Over time, it will have an almost equal benefit. Beyond the forward estimates period, it will have a greater benefit to high-income earners. Senator Cherry, you have fallen for the old pea and thimble trick. On a superficial analysis of the figures it looks better than the original government proposal but over time the exclusive tax cut is of greater benefit to high-income earners.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would be interested to know whether you have raised this in the negotiations. I would be interested to know whether you have the figures for the cost to revenue of these measures beyond 2007-08. I would be interested to know whether the minister has those figures.

The Labor Party are not uncomfortable with that. Should the Democrat amendments be passed, we do not see that as creating uncertainty in respect of the outcome of the other three messages, which we will vote on separately.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>16748</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was hoping not to speak again in this debate, but I have to respond to Senator Sherry. I point out that his tax proposal includes a two per cent tax cut for everybody on their superannuation co-contribution. That goes to high-income people as well as to low-income people. He talked about a two to one margin in favour of low-income people in our package in year 4. In his packageâunder his two per cent tax cutâthose same categories would be four to one in favour of high-income people, because they have more superannuation contributions than low-income people. I point out to Senator Sherry that we are not dealing with just what I have negotiated; we are dealing also with the comparison of his policy's two per cent tax cut for everybody. That is something I think he should bear in mind.</para></talk.start><para>I want to deal very briefly with the comments made by Senator Lees and with the question of whether we will ever get progress on the issue of recognition of interdependency in same sex relationships. I personally believe we can and we should, because the law is almost there. At the moment the law recognises under both the Superannuation Act and the tax act partial financial dependency as well as financial dependency. That means that the majority of relationships are covered under current tax and superannuation lawâthat is, that people can access superannuation and can receive the tax benefits. In moving to cover the next category of interdependent relationships, which include same sex relationships, we are trying to push it just a little bit further. It is not a huge step in terms of the tax impact or the superannuation impact, but for those people affected, it is a huge step in terms of fairness, equity and respect. That is why I think it is important.</para><para>Senator Lees suggests that we leave it on this bill. I think we can deliver the bulk of this package and still ensure that pressure is kept on the government to deal with interdependency and same sex relationships. We can do that by ensuring that it happens on one of the key funding mechanisms for this packageâthat is, the abolition of the low-income earners rebate. As I indicated, it is worth only around $10 million a year and about $100 per person to low-income people. I think it is reasonable to keep the pressure on government to deal with interdependency.</para><para>Part of me has thought with respect to this debate that it is not that big a step from where we are, recognising partial financial dependency, to recognise interdependency. People ask, `Why are you bothering?' I ask: why is the government holding it up? It is such a simple step to take to the next category of relationships. Why is the government holding it up and being so intransigent? This is one of the things I cannot understand, which is why I would like to addâand I ask Senator Lees to support us on thisâto the issues under dispute not just choice of funds and the spouse co-contribution bill but the low-income earners rebate. That way, we will have more pressure on government. I believe we can reach agreement on it; I really do. I believe we can reach an accommodation with government on this issue over the course of the next six to 12 months. I listened to Senator Watson's contribution to this debate, and he made it quite clear that there is merit in what we have been arguing for. I believe we can get there. There are clues in the message from the House that the government acknowledges to some extent that interdependency should be in some form recognised in law. We can get there. We need to keep the pressure up but we need to get this package through as well. </para><para>If, indeed, we come out of this debate with the co-contributions bill passed, the surcharge rate reduction bill passed and the consequential amendments bill held up, then we will have delivered 95 per cent of this package. But we will have held up five per centâwe will have added it to the list to keep pressure on the government to go that extra half-mile and deliver recognition of interdependent relationships. That is something that the Senate should do. All of us have to make choices at various times about how much leverage we have and how to use our balance of power position. It is a hard choice at times. I have found it very difficult in this debate to decide on the best way to deliver a good package while keeping pressure on to get rid of discrimination in superannuation relationships. I believe the proposals we have put up today will ensure that we deliver the bulk of this package so that it can be put in place from 1 July next year. In the meantime, they will also ensure that we keep pressure on with respect to this other issue. I think that is the best way to go, because we will ensure that we get this package up and remove discrimination against low-income people, while keeping pressure on the government to deal at some stage with interdependency. I believe that they can and they will, because eventually we have to get there.</para><para>I also point out to the Senate that if the government decides not to accept the amendments to the consequential amendments bill we will be insisting on, dealing with interdependency and same-sex relationships, then the penalty it will probably pay in the next financial yearâif this is not sorted out by thenâwill be, as I said, the abolition of the low-income earners rebate. That will mean that $10 million extra will flow to low-income earners. What is wrong with that? Senator Lees spoke about the discrimination against women in the current superannuation scheme. What is wrong with putting another $10 million in their back pockets? There is nothing wrong with that at all. From the point of view of the penalty clause, in terms of keeping that bit of extra pressure on government, I think it makes sense. Using what leverage we have in this place is not a bad way of getting through what has been a very difficult issue for the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>16749</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are dealing with three messages from the House of Representatives on the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003</inline>. I want to make it perfectly clear that we should deal with this matter on its merits. I am concerned, as a person who knows a large number of low-income earnersâparticularly people who are working part-timeâthat we should deal with this, as I said, as a start. </para></talk.start><para>The government has made a start on recognising the fact that, unless they are given a boost, low-income earners will not have satisfactory superannuation when the time comes for them to give up work. Quite frankly, here is an opportunity to accept the government'sâfirst-time ever, I thinkârecognition of the need to provide this boost. It is dollar for dollarâup to $1,000 a yearâon incomes of now up to $27,000, then on a reducing rate for incomes up to $40,000. That is very important. If I did not support it, I would not be able to hold my head up high or hold my own at the next meeting I might have of shop stewards in the shop assistants area, nor amongst colleagues who are fighting to improve wages and working conditions in the retail industry. They are getting increased wages and better working conditions, and here is an example. For the first time, as I say, the government is doing something practical in an area which is of great importance to them. The matter was referred to by Senator Lees, and I support what she said. I am not going to do anything today which would mean that a benefit to those people would be lost. </para><para>Also, I think that we ought to deal with this matter on the principle and the merit of the situation, and deal with the question of the extension to same-sex couples. Let me say this perfectly clearly: I do not believe that this legislation equals discrimination against homosexuals. In fact, superannuation treats everyone in our society equally and has made the judgment that there should be positive discrimination in favour of married couples or persons living in a marriage-like relationship. This decision is not against other groups but in favour of a particular type of relationship, which has been deemed to be important to the Australian community because of its ability to provide a safe and stable environment for children. It recognises the social good of marriage, that children need the protection of marriage and that children are the future of our community.</para><para>There are many other relationships, such as gay relationships, that are not the beneficiaries of this positive discrimination. There are a whole variety of relationships that could be identified as being based on loveâand in some, but not all, cases involve sexual relationsâwhich would find it convenient and beneficial to have this special recognition, but they are not relationships which have the same claim as marriage. They may be interdependent relationships, but my understandingâand it was confirmed, I think, by Senator Sherry in his quotation from the superannuation tribunalâis that trustees of a superannuation policy have a broad discretion as to whether they will award superannuation to a particular beneficiary. I think it is also the case that a trustee may decide that it is not appropriate to agree to a husband or wife being the beneficiary of a superannuation policy taken out by their spouse. I am happy if there is preferential treatment for married couples and a presumption that the married partner will be the beneficiary. This is not discrimination against others; it is an explicit recognition by the community of the importance of marriage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>16750</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Harradine is of course wrong on all counts. The fact is that superannuation was introduced in a way that had absolutely nothing to do with the institution, preservation or protection of marriage, but rather as a means for people to save for their retirement. That was the purpose of super. If you go back over the Senate and House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline> when superannuation was debated over the years, particularly when it became compulsory in the Keating years, you will find no reference whatsoever to superannuation having been instituted or cemented as a means of preserving marriage. It is a nonsense.</para></talk.start><para>More importantly, the reality is that superannuation paymentsâdeath benefits payments and reversionary pensions where they applyâare made to people who are not married: they are made to a surviving de facto partner. You cannot argue in any serious, intelligent way that the purpose of superannuation benefits is to protect marriage when significant numbers of payments are being made to people who are not married. Equally, it is not the case that a marriage relationship is the only one in which you will find children. Many de facto, non-married, opposite sex partners may be raising children. So, again, it is not valid to argue that superannuation is a way of looking after people who are raising children within a marriage, because many people have children outside marriage. </para><para>Perhaps more pertinently to this debate, Senator Harradine's contribution ignores the fact that many same sex couples have childrenâand the number doing so is increasing. More often than not that is the result of one partner in a same sex relationship having previously been in an opposite sex relationshipâa de facto or marriage situation. They may come with a child to a new, same sex relationship, so you have a new family unit. Equally, there are increasing numbers of lesbians having children either through adoption, now lawful in Western Australia and soon to be lawful in the ACT, or through IVF or surrogacy. Regardless of your particular personal moral position on that, the fact is that it is happening and the reality is that we, as a parliament, have to acknowledge that and respond appropriately with law.</para><para>Under Senator Harradine's scenario, to continue to specifically deny same sex couples automatic, full access to superannuation results in financial discrimination against that couple and their children, should they have any. My question to Senator Harradine is: why does he believe that specific financial discrimination against children being raised by same sex couples is appropriate? To put it another way, given that I believe firmly that the personal is political: why is it the case that, if I were to die, my partner of 18 years in Perth should be denied access to my superannuation, yet, if Senator Harradine were to die, his superannuation would go automatically to Mrs Harradine? My question specifically to Senator Harradine is this: how is it that denying my partner superannuation death benefits improves the marriage between Senator and Mrs Harradine?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>16751</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday we are dealing with three messages from the House of Representatives about three bills which have now been subjected to many hours of debate concerning what might be regarded as a red herring. We are dealing with the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, which is straightforward and will enable those who might need some encouragement to do something about saving more for their retirement. The second substantive bill we are debating, the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline>, is, I think, an overwhelmingly positive way in which this government has addressed the need to encourage low-income earners, and those who otherwise would have little incentive or inclination to save for their retirement, to at least make a start on putting away what they can, so that they will not be entirely dependent on the pension system. Together, these two measures address a very serious need for Australians, as a society, to look at the fact that we are an ageing population and to ensure that, wherever possible, we are making contributions for the benefit of our own retirement.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003,</inline> which is now the subject of a proposed amendment by the Democrats, delivers the tax machinery so that the arrangements will function, be coherent and enable both the surcharge and the co-contribution to work. Without the tax treatment and many of the measures in the consequential bill, you would simply have a dysfunctional system which does not deliver the co-contribution in the way that the government intended the policy to operate. </para><para>The bills are reasonably straightforward. The policy position I think is overwhelmingly a good one and has found favour with the Democrats. The government and the Democrats have been able to reach an agreementâindeed, a fair compromiseâto enable us to put these bills before the Senate for debate. The compromise realigns the benefits so that something in the order of two-thirds of the benefits will go to the co-contribution and low-income earners and the balance to reduction of the superannuation surcharge.

In Sydney yesterday, the Australian Federal Police, ASIO and the New South Wales Police undertook joint operations in connection with the arrest in France of a French national on terrorism related offences. The Australian government was advised by French authorities on 22 September that Mr Willie Brigitte, a French national, who reportedly participated in military training in Pakistan and Afghanistan, may have entered Australia in May 2003. I can confirm that Mr Brigitte entered Australia on 16 May on a tourist visa. On 7 October this year, further information was provided by French authorities, who expressed concern that Mr Brigitte might be in Australia in connection with terrorist related activity. Mr Brigitte was taken into custody in an immigration detention centre on 9 October for breaching the conditions of his visa. He was returned to France, under escort, on 17 October this year. On his return to France he was questioned and is now being held in custody in accordance with French law in connection with possible terrorism related offences. The Australian government has reacted swiftly and decisively in relation to this serious matter.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>âThe opposition might not think this is serious, but I can tell you that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, certainly thought it was serious.

It is timely to remember that just over a week ago, the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, launched the National Threat Assessment Centreâa keystone in our enhanced security arrangementsâand announced more than $50 million worth of funding to be spent over five years to enhance the operation of this important centre.

But there are community expectations and expectations of the government that the livestock trade be conducted humanely. In recent years, the government has joined with industry to ensure that the welfare of animals in the trade is treated with extreme importance.

We have also had very direct contact with relevant veterinary authorities in overseas markets. Our involvement in that is influencing a change in animal welfare outcomes, which have vastly improvedâalthough as a nation we have to be very sensitive to the cultural differences of our trading partners.

We think this is a useful and effective means through which we can put our views to China on human rights issues and hopefully influence China towards better practices in that regard. No-one disputes the importance of human rights; the issue is how best a country such as Australia can influence China in the right direction. We do believe that offering positive reinforcement as well as negative from time to time is the right direction, and the opening up of China that is occurring is consistent with a better human rights direction.

That is certainly the decision of the government. That has been discussed at great length with the industry, and the industry are supportive of that.

Furthermore, it condemned even the principle of it; it argued against bilateral attempts to open up markets for the benefit of Australian farmers. Here is an instance where the current Australian government, under Mr Howard, is endeavouring to open up US markets to Australian farmers. What the Labor Party ought to do is get behind the government in this attempt, because by doing so it will be benefiting Australia rather than trying to make cheap points. Nobody appreciates a Labor Party that just carpsâcontinually complains, continually acts so negatively.

It is a very important question following on from the question that was asked of Senator Minchin earlier and Senator Minchin's explanation and discussion about Labor's alternative policies. When we came to government in 1996 we inherited a $96 billion debt. It was costing Australians $4 billion in interest alone. They probably do not like to hear thatâ$4 billion in interest alone. The Labor Party were living beyond their means and beyond Australia's means. They were irresponsible. As I have said and I will say over and over again in this chamber, they were borrowing from the next generation to pay for short-term gain. That is what they were doing: borrowing from the next generation, not for deep infrastructure but to actually pay for short-term gain. Record high interest rates were eroding family household budgets and, coupled with the recession that we had to have, there were nearly one million people unemployed. You could not expect anything else from a party that cannot balance the books without relying on debt. Senator Minchin has explained already how they would be heading in that direction if they were ever to get their hands on the government levers again. </para></talk.start><para>Since we came into office we have delivered effective and targeted policies to increase the prospects of job seekers finding employment and to increase the wellbeing of families. The fairer tax system has not only decreased effective marginal tax ratesâtherefore putting more money in Australian workers' pocketsâbut also increased government family assistance by about $2 billion a year. Since March 1996 we have increased average real disposable incomes of low-income households by eight per centâinstead of being down at five per cent between 1992 and 1996 when, I remind honourable senators, Labor was in government.</para><para>We have replaced 12 payments for family assistance with three payments, providing around two million Australian families with additional assistance. We have made it easier for parents to make the decision to go back to work by spending more than $7 billion on child care in the first six years in office. This is a 70 per cent increase in real terms over and above what Labor spent in its last six years in office. We have produced 190,000 additional places since we came into office. With regard to the baby bonus, we will put $170 million into the budgets of households with a new firstborn child this financial year.

Labor say it is going to high-income families, but the data shows in the last year for which we have figures that the majority of people had incomes of $20,000 or less. The opposition said they will remove itâand that will be another tax on families.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If you look at the family tax benefit, under Labor when parents underestimated their incomes they were not eligible for a top-up.

Together with other assistance the Howard government will provide an estimated $19 billion to families this financial year. I remind honourable senators that one of benefits to families has been the assistance with their health insurance payments. One of the other things we have done is taken real action to reduce unemployment. I remind honourable senators that the last time unemployment was below six per cent, interest rates were below five per cent and the CPI was below three per cent was 35 years ago. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16765</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Long-term unemployment has also dropped since we came into office by 17.6 per cent in the last five years. We are now spending $2.2 billion annually to support more than 380,000 young people through the youth allowance, enabling them and encouraging them to take up training and to study. We are delivering a real difference for Australian job seekers and their families.

This is the fourth round of talks commencing this week, so it is very important that the Australian public and community have a clear indication from this government of what our objectives are, what we are prepared to give up and what we are not prepared to give up. That is what is at stake.</para><para>The government is starting to show worrying signs of backsliding on previous commitments on local content. It has long been clear the US government wanted, in this area, a thing called `standstill'. That is, Australia could retain the existing local content rules for film, radio and television but would trade off the right to either increase local content quotas or apply them to new media in the future as the mechanism for delivering programming changes. Until recently the government appeared to accept the vital importance of retaining the right to regulate local content in new forms of media. Earlier this month Australia's chief negotiator, Stephen Deady, told the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee:</para><quote><para>... it certainly is wrong to say that our offer is a standstill offer, because it is not.</para></quote><para>But the government has shifted ground following the visit by President Bush just last week. Minister Vaile warned that it would not be easy to resist US demands for no local content rules on new forms of delivery. Then the Prime Minister told the President that Australia would accept a more liberal regime to apply to the Internet and other new media. Yet when Senator Hill is asked about it today, what does he say? To use the Prime Minister's current favourite word, flummery is all we got from Senator Hill. The recently concluded Singapore agreement includes the provision:</para><quote><para>Australia reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure relating to:</para><para>the creative arts(1), cultural heritage(2) and other cultural industries, including audio-visual services, entertainment services and libraries, archives, museums and other cultural services ...</para></quote><para>If such a protection is deemed necessary in an agreement with Singapore, how can it not be essential in a free trade deal with the United States, the home of the largest film and television production industry in the world? </para><para>The other area where backsliding appears to have begun relates to market access. There is no more critical point in these negotiations than this one. Labor maintains that any FTA with the US must deliver significant and tangible benefits to Australian farmers. At the commencement of negotiations, the government committed Australia to seeking the removal of tariff rate quota restrictions on Australian exports to the United States, especially those affecting beef, dairy, sugar, peanuts and cotton. Last week the US Trade Representative, Mr Zoellick, announced in Bangkok that under the latest offer only 21 per cent of US agricultural products would be opened up to competition from Australian producers immediately once the agreement came into effect. Why is this important? In the last two weeks the Prime Minister has proudly announced that the Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement had been signed and put out a press release. He said:</para><quote><para>More than half of Thailand's five thousand tariffs will be eliminated as soon as the Agreement enters into force. Virtually all the remaining tariffs will be eliminated by 2010.</para></quote><para>Let me read that again:</para><quote><para>Virtually all the remaining tariffs will be eliminated by 2010.</para></quote><para>When the agreement is announced you get a press release from the Prime Minister so that the Prime Minister gets lots of nice kudos and lots of support publicly, and that is what is in the papers the next day. But, when you get to see what the agreement actually says, you see that the Prime Minister failed to mention the following facts. For beef, pork, butter, cheese, potatoes and sugar, it will be not by 2010 but by 2020 before we get free access. For some of our biggest exports it will be 2020. The killer, though, is that for milk, cream and skim milk powder, the year we get free access will be 2025. We have a Prime Minister who says on the one hand:</para><quote><para>Virtually all the remaining tariffs will be eliminated by 2010.</para></quote><para>On the other hand, the tariffs on our biggest exports into the area will not be eliminated until 2025. This is a government that you cannot trust. It says one thing and does another.

We have a very strong export culture. You can see that in the free trade agreement with Thailand that was announced last week. That provides a market opportunity of an additional 63 million people for Australian manufacturers and primary producers. The negotiations were concluded with the fastest-growing economyâand a stand-out economyâin South-East Asia, Thailand. We feel very strongly about these bilateral arrangements.

If we did not get a deal that is acceptable to the Australian government, to the Australian manufacturers, to Australian farmers and to the Australian film industry, why would you think for one moment we would conclude the deal? We would not and we will not. The government aim to deliver a world-class agreement.</para><para>As has been made very clear in the media this week, the penultimate stage or round in the negotiations is taking place in Canberra this week. We have a world-class FTA negotiating team, and I am very confident in what they will do. They have the support of the government in their efforts to deliver a world-class agreement. They do aim for finalisation this year. If you listened to what President Bush said last week, you would know that he reconfirmed the United States' commitment to this deadline. The Prime Minister told President Bush that Australia needs to see a good deal in agriculture for the FTA to be acceptable to us because we are a leading exporter and producer of agriculture. We produce five times the amount of food we can consume ourselves. We believe very much in providing access to Australian markets, but in return we require access to the world markets and we are prepared to work very hard to achieve that.</para><para>The Prime Minister and President Bush further agreed when they met last week in Canberra that following negotiations in Canberra this week Mr Vaile and the US Trade Representative, Bob Zoellick, would meet in the United States before Christmas. We need to wait and see what the US negotiators put on the table this week. It is very foolish to prejudge outcomes, because we all know in trade negotiations that what appear to be impossible and difficult sticking points can be worked out through goodwill and by trade-offs. But I think it is fair to say that Australia is aiming for improvements in the US offer across the board and that we expect to receive more detailed US requests on a range of issues. This has been quite a long process. There have been two full negotiating rounds, which are still to be completed. The government have been very keen to seek stakeholder and industry support.

I remind senators and the public that, also on that occasion, there were protesters assembled outside the parliament. There were a lot more of them than there were here last week.

It is interesting, in the light of the debate we are having now and the questions that were addressed to Senator Cook, that today the NFF is once again making it clear to the governmentâthis time to a coalition governmentâthat they are not happy with the situation and with the view adopted by the United States with respect to this free trade agreement.

I recall that people like Graham Blight from the National Farmers Federation, and others from the agricultural and rural sectors of this countryânot the natural affiliates of the Labor Partyâwere fulsome in their praise of the efforts of Peter Cook and others as ministers for trade when we were in government. Of course, we were also the prime movers in establishing APEC. So, while ministers in this government ask what we did in 13 years, our record is incredibly strong in terms of what we did to promote trade liberalisation.

Let us talk about free trade for a second.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Gough Whitlamâfor all his failures, for all his mistakes and despite a really appalling government in the 1970sâdid one thing that was right: he cut tariffs. Do you know why he cut tariffs? He said tariffs were a tax on the working class. Anyone who supports tariffs supports taxing the working class. When you talk about tariffs, the people who suffer the most are not the Labor Party and their union friends. It is not them. Do you know who it is? It is the poor, it is those in the developing countries and exporters. They are the ones who suffer the most. So when you get this sanctimonious stuff from the Australian Labor Party, this reflexive anti-Americanism that they always foster, it is based on this. The fact is Mr Whitlam knewâeven if the Labor Party today does not knowâthat tariffs hurt the workers. If just that point gets through this afternoon, perhaps this debate will have been worth while. Mr Hawke, Mr Keating and indeed Senator Cook, for all their failures, understood that message as well. So when people like this get out there and support all these losersâwho wrecked the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattleâor at least play footsy with the far Left, all they are doing is causing workers and poor people to suffer. But of course that would not worry the Labor Party these days. It certainly would not worry all the inner-city swingers.</para><para>The reason Australia fundamentally has done so well in the last 20 years, particularly in the last seven years, is not just because of our marvellous policies. Despite the failures of the Labor Party, the one fundamental reason why Australia has done so well over the last 20 years, and particularly over the last seven, has been the reduction in tariffs. That is the principal reason. And now, of course, the opposition thinks: `Oh, we need an issue to belt the government with. Maybe we can just foster a little bit of fear.' You see, they need something to get back to their working-class constituency, because of their absolute, abject failure to connect with the working class.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name></talker><para>âThe battlers now support us, Senator Forshaw, because of your absolute failure to engage with them.

The artists of Australia are not losers. People who have concerns with this issue should not be described by you, in a very deprecating and insulting way, as `losers'.

Show some concern about this particular treaty when it comes to the sovereignty of Australia. Their concerns go to social policy, cultural policy and economic policy. Australians realise that they have a fawning, obsequious government, not concernedânot reallyâand not understanding that there is a major economic power balance in these trade negotiations. They are concerned that this government does not see that, as my colleague Senator Conroy showed, the immediate benefits to Australia are likely to be limited. They can see a government that cannot see what the rest of Australia, the rest of America and the rest of the world can seeâthat is, real concessions, particularly in the farm sector, will not be realised, particularly in an election year in the USA. President Bush relies on those southern farming states for his support. He cannot afford to lose them. Do you reckon he is going to shaft his farmers in the interests of ours? Absolutely no way at all. The farm sector in this country is smart enough to see that, but their representatives in this place call them `losers'. That is the sort of debate we have from the other side of the parliament. They are falling over themselves to shake President Bush's hand and, in the meantime, are about to make major concessions to the US. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Hill and I know what the Americans are like when it comes to international negotiations. We were at The Hague conference on reducing greenhouse gas emissions a little while ago. We could see that, on the one hand, while the rest of the world was trying to get an agreement on environmental grounds to protect the environment, the Americans were trying to find every opportunity possible to introduce non-tariff subsidies for their farm sector. As Minister for Consumer Affairs just a few years ago, I took a decision to ban the import of smokeless tobacco into this country.

I am very disappointed that Senator Mason has not remained, because I was going to speak about the danger of moral relativism and some of the problems that some people in the country have in equating human rights problems of Western regimes with the human rights problems in China. It is a point that Senator Mason frequently makesâin fact, he seems to make it every time he stands up to speak, and I was surprised that he did not manage to fit it in this timeâwhich is consistent with what happened last week during the visits of the two presidents to Australia. Unfortunately, we had significant public protests on the Thursday against some of the policies of the Bush regime in the USAâprotests that the Democrats support and concerns that the Democrats share, I might say. But, on the Friday, during the visit by a president who is the representative of a regime that has human rights abuses far in excess of those of the United States, there were minimal protests from the general public and I think that was very unfortunate. It sends a message that the public are more concerned about the human rights and the broader record of the US regime than they are about the Chinese regime, even though there is clearly a greater degree of human rights abuses by the Chinese government over many years.  </para><para>I would have thought that Senator Mason would be applauding the fact that that discrepancy has been brought to public opinion and applauding the fact that President Huâwho is still, let us not forget, the heir of Chairman Mao, whom he goes to great lengths to abuse and criticise, quite rightlyâwas in Australia last week. Yet there was not as much public outrage about the degree of human rights abuses of that regime as there was towards the US regime. The Democrats have been consistent on this issue. We expressed strong concerns both in the lead-up to and on the day of President Hu's visit and subsequently about the human rights abuses of the Chinese regime. </para><para>I note the minister's extra information that he provided at the end of question time saying that the Prime Minister did raise human rights issues in his one-on-one discussions with President Hu, when he was here in Australia last Friday. He did not indicate what issues he raised or in what way they were raised. Nonetheless, the fact that human rights dialogue was noted and raised needs to be welcomed. The minister's extra answer seemed to suggest that the issue of Tibet was specifically raised and the Democrats are very pleased about that. We also would note and support some of the positive advances that have been made in recent years, such as the dialogue that China has now initiated with representatives of the Dalai Lama regarding the future of Tibet. This was raised by the representatives of the Tibetan community and supporters of the Tibetan cause in a letter that was signed by a number of parliamentarians, prior to the arrival of President Hu, indicating our support for those initial advances by the Chinese regime and encouraging them to go further. However, it has to be drawn from the minister's two answers that broader issues of human rights abuses in China were not raised. It is good to emphasise the positive and, as the minister said, give credit where it is due, but that should not be used as an excuse to sweep what are still very extreme human rights abuses under the carpetâhuman rights abuses that are much wider than the issue of Tibet, although I do not seek to diminish that issue at all. </para><para>Let us look at some of the facts of the issues which are affecting not just Chinese families but Australian families. In the weeks leading up to President Hu's visit, the Democrats met with Australians whose families are being subjected to persecution in ChinaâAustralians who live in daily fear for the welfare of their mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters. More than 1,600 people have been tortured or beaten to death in China and more than 500 people have been given prison sentences of over 20 years, simply for exercising their freedom of belief and their freedom of religion. This is unacceptable. It has to be raised. We cannot ignore these issues simply because there are trade opportunities. The Democrats support exploring trade opportunities, but that should not be used as an excuse to not raise uncomfortable or important issues. It is unfortunate. Indeed, it should be condemned that the Prime Minister did not raise these issues.

In 1997 the Chinese threatened trade sanctions unless we removed human rights from the focus of the bilateral dialogue and did not involve ourselves in UN discussions relating to violations of human rights in China. That is the genesis of the government now saying that human rights in China is an area of discussion we should not be involved in. We are already involved in it. A number of academics have studied the process of the annual dialogue. They have shown that, generally speaking, there are no publicly stated benchmarks and an irregularâor non-existentâprogram of evaluation. There is very little transparency in the process. Partners are more open about claiming positive results, although it is often hard to link these results directly to the dialogue.  </para></talk.start><para>I am very pleased to be part of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. That committee is going to request that the government approve the matter of the human rights dialogue and how it can be improved as a subject for inquiry.

I hope that this is the case, and we can satisfy the fundamentals of a proper dialogue, rather than just having the dialogue as an excuse for not confronting the particular leaders when the opportunity arises. </para><para>I will not go into the gross violations of human rights in the PRC.

To recognise that policy, particularly in higher educationâfrom which much of Australia's economic and social development will be driven, certainly for the first quarter of this centuryâwe will need to adapt to economic and social changes in Australia that see this country moving from agrarian, land and labour intensive industries increasingly into services based industries.</para><para>Learning how to learn and to produce ideasâand from them technologiesâwill increasingly need to be applied not only to traditional commodities and industries to maintain economic and environmental sustainability but also to new and emerging ones and those that, today, we may not know even exist. Australia's universities, Australia's 38 publicly funded universities in particular, are in need of reform.</para><para>The case for reform rests on two inescapable but unpalatable truths: the first is that Australian universities need access to more moneyâand a lot more of it in the long term; the second is that money is only half the problem. The way in which universities are regulated, managed and administered is as much at the root of the challenges facing Australian higher education as is the level of resourcing. </para><para>Australiansâwherever we live; whatever our circumstancesâhave nowhere to hide from the winds of change. The pressures for the international benchmarks against which Australian universities will be judged are increasingly drawing down upon us. Those pressures include: the move from elite to a mass form of higher education; a revolution in telecommunications; globalisation with sweeping economic and social change, which many Australians still feel ill-prepared to face; and, importantly, the move to lifelong learning where the next generation can no longer expect to do one form of education and think that it will equip them for 40 or 50 years of a working life.</para><para>This government has recognised that, in order to build an economic and social legacy for the next generation in which we can have confidence, it is essential that Australian higher education be reformed. The government announced early last year that there would be an extensive review of Australian universities. On behalf of the government I established a reference group to give me advice through the course of the review. Seven discussion papers were released, 49 focus groups were held to which 800 people were invited and over 200 hours of evidence was taken from the length and breadth of Australia. More than 700 submissions to the review were received. The Productivity Commission was commissioned to examine the funding, administration and management of universities in North America and Europe and to compare them with that in Australia. The review process was also informed by a two-day session in Canberra comprising a variety of individuals and organisations including businesspeople, unions, academics, school-teachers and everyday Australians.</para><para>The result of the review process is that, today, we introduce a piece of legislation that is absolutely essential to equip Australia for the 21st centuryâeducationally, culturally, socially and economically. This legislation gives effect to the government's budget announcement that in the next four years it will invest $1.5 billion of additional public funding in Australian universities, and over the next 10 years there will $10.6 billion additional public funding invested in universities: $6.9 billion of it directly and some $3.7 billion additional support for students.</para><para>The reforms are complex, and necessarily so because of the complexities of the issues that face the sector. In no particular order, the problems that we are seeking to address include the fact that every university in Australia is currently funded and administered in exactly the same way; that under the current policy framework the country cannotânor ever willâboast a university in any international top 50 or 100 league table; we face a situation where the sector has students that are overenrolledâwe have university students who are overenrolled by about eight per cent across the sector; we have some 30,000 to 40,000 students, in recognised private higher education institutions, who receive no form of public assistance whatsoever despite the fact that they are Australian taxpayers.</para><para>We currently fund and run every university in exactly the same way. Sydney University and the University of New South Wales compete with one another, but increasingly they are competing with the rest of the world. Australians need to know that already universities in Singapore, North America and increasingly Europe are seeking to recruit the best and brightest Australian students to their universities on the basis that if they want `a world-class university education they will need to leave Australia'. I ask Australians to think about how they would react if other countries were recruiting our best swimmers or athletes on the basis that the only way that they would be able to receive world-class training would be to go to another country.</para><para>Charles Sturt University, Sunshine Coast University, Edith Cowan University and University of South Australia are all outstanding institutions, but they are all different. Under the current policy framework, we do not recognise nor fund the increasingly onerous and complex community service obligations that are being placed upon non research intensive universities that are in the regions of Australia. This package seeks to address that.  </para><para>The financial barriers that students face are not those of tuition fees, which are met through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme once they have graduated; the costs that students meet are compulsory union and guild fees, computers, textbooks, living expenses and a whole variety of things for which they receive Youth Allowance and Austudy on an income-tested basis. The government is seeking to provide further financial assistance to students whilst they are students.</para><para>At the moment, the commercialisation of intellectual property in Australian universities is patchy at best. Only 0.16 per cent of university revenue is derived from royalties, trademarks and licences; world's best practice would take it to about five per cent. Even with cashed-in equity, we peak at around three per cent. </para><para>We also have a very narrow range of remuneration for Australia's academics in this sectorâsome 38,000 of them. Whilst the Productivity Commission report found that by international standards Australian academics are relatively well remunerated, the range of remuneration is relatively narrow. In addition, the government have recognised the need to increase the resources available for the training of teachers and for the training of nurses. We also found, unfortunately, that academics in Australian universities are appointed and promoted not on the basis of their ability to do what Australians need them to do and do wellâthat is, teachâbut rather on their ability to attract and maintain research activity and resources within their own universities.</para><para>The government is also determinedâin the words of Dean Mary Kalantzis, the President of the Australian Council of Deans of Educationâto `bring students from the periphery to the centre of the higher education experience'. In this bill, the government is introducing measures that will see much greater emphasis placed on quality of teaching and learning in higher education. There are also significant challenges to be met in ensuring students from lower income backgrounds get access to university education âand no more so than amongst Indigenous Australians.</para><para>In response to requests from every one of the Vice-Chancellors of Australia's 38 universities, the government has also recognised that it is important that universities respond positively to the request that they need the flexibility to determine the value of their courses and to set HECS charges. The government has said that, whilst it will not allow any increase for the 14 per cent of students in universities who are undertaking teacher education or nursing, it will allow universitiesâfor the first time in Australiaâto determine the value of the HECS charge levied on the student on the courses which are undertaken. </para><para>This package comprises many components and each is interlinked. It is not possible to maintain the fundamental integrity of the package by removing key elements from it. What the government is seeking to do with this package is to change the fundamental way in which universities are being fundedâto move the universities to a discipline mix for funding; to fund the universities on the basis of what they actually do provide and deliver to studentsâso that a student undertaking a course in one university, whether it be business administration, nursing, veterinary science or law, will receive the same level of public support as does a student in any other university.</para><para>An additional $404 million will be available in the first three years under what will be called the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, which will represent respectively over the first three years a 2.5 per cent, a five per cent and then a 7.5 per cent increase in core funding to universities. In addition, the Commonwealth will be making $122.6 million available to universities and campuses in the regions of Australia. Some 32 universities in more than 55 campuses will receive an additional loadingâfrom 1.5 per cent for the University of Wollongong through to 30 per cent for the Northern Territory University and Batchelor College in the Northern Territoryâto recognise that those universities are operating from a much narrower commercial, industrial and economic base. </para><para>The government will also require that, in order for the first $404 million extra money to be available, two things must be undertaken. Firstly, there must be governance reform of the universitiesâthe universities must be compliant with national protocols for best practice in governance. We cannot say today that governance and administration arrangements that were appropriate for the early and mid parts of the 20th century will equip institutions for the 21st century and a world that is quite different. </para><para>University governing councils have business expertise which ranges from zero to 64 per cent. Commercial expertise is sadly wanting in most university governing councils. Council size average is 21 but can be as high as 35 for the University of Queensland. The government does not consider it appropriate that working members of parliamentâwhatever their respective merits might beâshould be serving members of university governing councils. There should be professional development provided for people going on to university governing councils who will be running budgets of up to almost $1 billion a year.</para><para>The second thing that is very important is that the universities be compliant with the government's workplace relations policies. That means that any employee of a university should be free to have negotiated on their behalf an enterprise agreement by the organisation or union of their choice. Equally, any employee should be freeâas they currently areâto negotiate a common law contract or an Australian workplace agreement. Once those two conditions have been met in governance and workplace relations, the universities will then be able to access the first $404 million of additional public investment.</para><para>The government is also investing $40.4 million, representing a 7.1 per cent increase in funding, for the training of nurses to assist them in leaving university to spend more time in hospitals training for the careers of their choice. The government will also be increasing, by 9.7 per cent, the money that is available for the teaching of teachers, so that education students can spend more time in classrooms.</para><para>The number of HECS places will be increased in this package. At the moment, on average, eight percent of the students in the university sector are overenrolled. Almost 40 per cent of the students at Charles Sturt University are overenrolledâin part because of arrangements with the police academyâranging down to 2Â½ per cent at the University of South Australia. In the package that was announced in the Budget, the government said that it would allow the universities to overenrol only up to two percent.</para><para>In response to arguments that have been put to us by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and Mr Mullarveyâwhom I commend for his advocacy on behalf of the Vice-Chancellors who argue that that overenrolment range is too narrowâthis legislation will enable universities to at least have a tolerance band of up to five per cent. The government will fully fund, at a cost of $347.4 million over four years, 25,000 of those currently overenrolled places in Australian universities. One of the reasons that students are packed in like sardines in university lecture theatres is that in many cases the students are overenrolled.</para><para>The government will also be funding 1,400 additional growth places, at a cost of $10.9 million, in 2007. There will be 1,400 additional medical school HECS places over the first five years, there will be 574 places specifically for nursing in regional universities and there will be 745 priority places in nursing and teaching; these are extra places. In addition, the Commonwealth will be locking in on a long-term basis the 655 places in teaching and nursing at Avondale College. The government will also be funding a further 2,850 growth places in 2008.</para><para>One of the most important changes in these reforms is the recognition that, as the world and the needs of Australian universities are changing, Australians should be no less free to take up, if they are academically qualified, a full fee paying place in an Australian university than a citizen from another country. The government will allow the universities, once they have filled all of their HECS places and if they choose to, to then offer a full fee paying place to an Australian citizen who is academically qualified and considered to be so by the university. For the first time, the Commonwealth government will lend those students money on the same income contingent arrangements as HECS, except there will be a 3.5 percent interest rate added to the CPI indexation of that debt. The interest rate will be capped at 10 years, and the loan to the student will be $50,000. </para><para>Students will also be able to take those loans to recognised, private higher education providers. So, for the first time, students who may not currently have the resources may choose to go to Bond University, the University of Notre Dame, the Australian Institute of Music in Sydney, Tabor College, Christian Heritage College or a myriad of other excellent higher education providers. </para><para>In relation to regional loading, this bill will respond to another request from the Vice-Chancellorsâthat external load also be counted in terms of receiving additional funding. Students who are enrolled externally will also receive additional resources. </para><para>One of the other important pieces of reform is that, for the first time, a signal will be sent to Australian students that they cannot repeatedly go on doing undergraduate courses. Four per cent of students who enrolled in an undergraduate course last year already had an undergraduate degree. We cannot allow a situation to continue where some students perpetually enrol in one undergraduate degree after another. That causes a logjam in the system and denies places at the other end to young people and not so young people who are trying to get into university.</para><para>A Commonwealth learning entitlement will be introduced. It will be for five years or whatever is the minimum period of time for a vocational qualificationâand for courses that are five years or longer, an additional year will be added. Beyond that period of time, if students wish to continue doing undergraduate degrees, they can continue to do so, but they will be able to access a loan from the Commonwealth government. </para><para>The loan schemes provided by the government will be renamed in this bill to the Higher Education Loan ProgramâHELP. There will be HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP, for full fee paying students and those who go to recognised private higher education institutions. Also for the first time there will be OS-HELPâoverseas HELP. One of the critically important things for us is to not only attract foreign students to Australia but also encourage Australian students to spend some of their time as undergraduates studying in universities in other countries. So, for the first time, up to $10,000 will be lent to students by the Commonwealth governmentâagain on an income contingent basisâto allow them to spend some time undertaking some of their undergraduate studies in another country.</para><para>With this package, the government will also be undertaking a number of important reforms to support Indigenous participation in higher education. An additional $10.4 million will be added to the Indigenous Support Fund. The government will require universities to ensure that there is Indigenous participation in decision making in universities and that outreach programs are being run to support and encourage Indigenous students to enrol and to support them once they have enrolled. </para><para>The government will also ensure that an Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council be established to give advice to the Australian government on what initiatives it should take in relation to supporting Indigenous students. With this bill, the government will also be announcing a further $6.9 million of additional support over the next three years for equity programs. Universities will be required to run outreach programs to support equity students. </para><para>The universities will also be required to run a scholarship program within their own institution and to manage the Commonwealth's scholarship programs. One of the other major problems, which I outlined earlier and which is addressed in this bill, is the financial support of students. A Commonwealth learning scholarship program will be introduced, and 25,100 scholarships will be made available to students over the first four years at a cost of $161 million.</para><para>Students from low-income families will for the first time have available to them scholarships to support their education costs. There will be 17,665 scholarships, each worth up to $8,000 over four years. In addition, there will be 7,550 accommodation scholarships, which will each be worth some $16,000 over four years to students to support their accommodation costs.</para><para>This bill will also recognise a number of performance issues that were argued to us throughout the review. The first is that, to improve the quality of teaching in Australian universities, universities will for the first time have access to $138 million over the first four years for a quality learning and teaching performance fund. In order to access that fund, universities must have systematic student evaluation of the quality of teaching in that institution and it must be published. Probation and promotion within that university will depend as much on teaching as it does on research.</para><para>There will be $55.4 million available for a workplace performance pool. For access to that, universities will need to ensure that there is a genuine performance based pay scheme available in their university and a genuine culture of performance and rewarding performance.  </para><para>There will also be a $36.6 million collaboration and structural reform pool, the intent of which is to support, for the first time, universities undertaking innovative projects which, for example, co-locate universities with TAFE and senior secondary college; importantly, the government will be focusing on proposals which have the support of the business communities and/or state governments. The process of examining research in Australian universities is currently under way with a number of reviews. I will be announcing on behalf of the government early next year the outcome of a series of reviews looking at the way in which Australian research is funded.</para><para>This package also gives focus to arts, humanities and social sciences with the establishment, amongst other things, of an advisory council in support of it. The government will also be establishing a higher education business advisory council, and I will shortly be announcing its composition. There is currently a process under way being led by Treasury to examine innovative ways of funding Australian universities, again at the request of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and others within the sector. </para><para>Throughout the debate on this package, an argument put repeatedly by those who are opposed to it will be that students who get a place at university should do so only on merit. There will be those who will argue stridently against opportunities in full fee paying places in Australian universities being offered to Australian citizens that are currently offered to foreign studentsâwhom we welcomeâand against the government for the first time providing loans in support of them.</para><para>I say to the parents of Australia, not only as Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training but as a parent myself, that it is critically important that we realise we will do our children and our future no service whatsoever if we leave them a higher education sector which is racked with mediocrityâwhere access might readily be available but the quality and the standard of the education being provided is ranked poorly by international standards. </para><para>This package increases substantially the number of publicly funded places in universities. It ensures a significant increase in public investment in universities. The Australian taxpayer will continue to pay almost three-quarters of the cost of providing university education, and those who benefit from that university education, once they have graduated and are earning in excess of $30,000 a year, will subsequently pay back their HECS contribution.</para><para>For the very first time, the universities will have to sit down and decide themselves what is the value of their courses to prospective students. Meaningful information will have to be available to prospective students and their families about the quality of what is being provided. The maximum possible increase that students could face being added to their HECS debt per year is $2,000 if they are training to be a lawyer, a dentist, a vet or a doctor; $1,600 if they are training to be an economist, an engineer or a scientist; $1,200 per year if they are training in arts, humanities or social sciences; and absolutely no change whatsoever if they are undertaking teaching or nursing.</para><para>For every last dollar that is invested in the universities by studentsâevery additional dollarâthere will be at least two extra taxpayer dollars, and every last dollar will be spent on improving the quality of the education that will be received by the current and the next generation of Australian students. The HECS cut-offs are determined by competition, not by academic merit. </para><para>One in 15 students who got a place at university this year did so not on merit; they got there because they were educated in difficult educational circumstancesâand I support that. But let us not as a country then turn our backs on those who missed out on a HECS place with an entry score of 99 and deny them the opportunity, if they choose, to take up a full fee paying placeâan opportunity that is offered and taken up by foreign studentsâand force them to do a HECS place in a course that they do not want to be in.</para><para>These reforms are critically important to the future of our country. I implore Australians to go beyond what is being said by the opponents of this package and look for the truth. I implore parents in particular to examine the best interests of their children and their children's future, and to look in particular at what needs to be done to put Australian higher education on a sound footing for this century. It is my belief that when they do so they will appreciate that, whilst not all measures in this package may be popular in all sections of the community, they are long overdue and are needed.  </para><para>âââââ</para><para><inline ref="R1909">HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</inline></para><para>I have just introduced the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 which proposes the most fundamental changes to our higher education system in over 20 years.

The first is to amend Commonwealth legislation to confer appropriate law enforcement powers on the proposed Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission and the office of Parliamentary Inspector of the Corruption and Crime Commission. The second is to amend the Interception Act to allow law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Federal Police, to obtain warrants under the Act to assist in the investigation of offences involving people smuggling aggravated by exploitation, slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting. </para><para>In February 2003, the Government of Western Australia announced its intention to establish a new body, the Corruption and Crime Commission, to address corruption and organised crime in Western Australia. The establishment of the Commission, which will eventually replace the existing Anti-Corruption Commission, will implement a recommendation of the Royal Commission into the Western Australian Police Service undertaken by the Hon G A Kennedy AO QC. The Parliamentary Inspector of the Corruption and Crime Commission, also to be established by the Western Australian Government, will in turn investigate and report on allegations of misconduct directed at the Commission.</para><para>The Government believes it is appropriate for the proposed Corruption and Crime Commission to be provided with those law enforcement powers which are necessary to carry out its functions. The proposed powers are consistent with those available to the Anti-Corruption Commission, the body it will replace.</para><para>The amendments will enable the Commission to receive information collected by telecommunications interception conducted by other agencies relevant to the performance of the Commission's functions. </para><para>The amendments will also enable the Commission to be declared an agency for the purposes of the Interception Act, allowing it to apply for and execute telecommunications interception warrants in its own right. The declaration of the Corruption and Crime Commission as an agency under the Interception Act is a separate process that may be initiated by a request from the Premier of Western Australia and cannot occur until I am satisfied that State legislation subjects the new body to appropriate record-keeping requirements and accountability measures. Telecommunications interception has proven to be an extremely valuable investigative tool for law enforcement agencies and anti-corruption bodies. These amendments will ensure that the Commission receives relevant intercepted information and in due course is able to seek declaration as an agency for the purposes of obtaining and executing warrants in the conduct of investigations by the Commission.</para><para>The amendments will also allow the Parliamentary Inspector of the Corruption and Crime Commission to receive intercepted information relevant to the performance of its functions. The Parliamentary Inspector does not require the ability to apply for and execute telecommunications interception warrants in its own right and it is not intended that that office become an agency under the Act.</para><para>The bill also amends the Crimes Act to allow authorised officers of the Corruption and Crime Commission to acquire and use evidence of an assumed identity in the course of investigating corruption and serious criminal activity.</para><para>Finally, the bill amends the Financial Transaction Reports Act to allow the Commission to access financial transaction reports information from AUSTRAC.</para><para>Access to this information is a valuable investigate tool in the fight against serious and organised crime and corruption.</para><para>The second object of the bill is to amend the Interception Act to allow law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Federal Police, to obtain warrants to assist in the investigation of offences involving people smuggling aggravated by exploitation, slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting set out in the Criminal Code. The trafficking of people into Australia and the exploitation of those people is an issue of significant concern to the Government. The Government has been working to develop a strategy to arm law enforcement agencies with the capacity to investigate these offences and to facilitate prosecutions where evidence of illegal activity is uncovered. </para><para>The nature of trafficking means that victims often fear that speaking out will result in action against either themselves or their family. The availability of telecommunications interception warrants will provide law enforcement agencies with a valuable tool to assist in the collection of information that may not otherwise be available in relation to these very serious offences. </para><para>The Government recognises that telecommunications interception is an intrusive method of investigation and reaffirms its commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals using the Australian telecommunications system.

I now want to address some remarks on the government's agreement with the Democrats. As I started to say when I was last speaking about it, the agreement represented a fair compromise and an alignment of the benefits so that low-income earners do get the lion's share of the superannuation pie. Indeed, it was a flexible arrangement and it was one that the government were pleased to negotiate with the Democrats. It certainly preserved and delivered on the government's election promises, whilst we listened to and responded to some of the comments we had received about the package. The agreement was not only verbal, reached over a period of time; it was also formalised in an exchange of letters. The compromise that was reached between the government and the Democrats was very well publicised and, I am very happy to say, very well received by those who have been waiting for some considerable time for these measures. Absolutely no-one has contacted me and complained about the substance of these bills. </para></talk.start><para>I have to say to the Senate that there was no mention at all in the negotiations of the Democrats' insistence now that there should be some amendments that relate to same-sex couples and other relationships. This did not surprise me because, no matter how you look at these bills, there is no conceivable discrimination in any of them. No matter how you look at it, it is not possible to find any discrimination against anyone on the basis of family or same-sex arrangements. So obviously I was not surprised when the Democrats did not raise this issue during our negotiations. It formed no part of the negotiations and indeed does not form any part of the formal agreement that we reached.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âSo they didn't raise it!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>âI can hear Senator Sherry tut-tutting over there. What we saw from the Labor Party, on the other hand, was an attempt to create mischief in relation to these bills. We know that the Labor Party have largely dealt themselves out of the debate on superannuation. They have made themselves utterly irrelevant to any of the issues that were debated. As we have now been debating them over several days, I think it would be fair to say that the Labor Party are getting very close to tedious repetition of their points on these bills. But they knew that their stance on same-sex couples would embarrass the Democrats. They also knew that, with respect to these bills, the government would not move on the amendments because there is no possible discrimination to respond to in relation to these bills. Every single person in this chamber knows that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Last time these bills were debated, the Democrats said that they would insist on an amendment to the consequential bills but would not vote on it when the bill was returned from the House of Representatives. Today, at the heel of the hunt, we have seen an ill-judged attempt by the Democrats to try to preserve some financial leverage over the government for another day and for another bill by seeking to move the tax machinery in the consequential bill to the surcharge bill. It will not really work like that, and I will tell the Senate why very shortly.</para><para>They are seeking of course to do something very clumsy, and that is to retain the existing tax rebate that will continue to be paid and eventually provide a double benefit. The problem with these heroics, however, is that the Democrats are in very grave danger of being hoist with their own petard here. Firstly, the Democrats have welshed on their deal. There is no other word for it, no other charitable way of putting it, no other colour or gloss to put on itâthey have simply welshed on their deal.</para><para>Secondly, this welshing on their deal raises the very serious question for all Australians: just what is the worth of the Democrats' word? This is a very serious issue that everyone listening to this debate and following this debacle must be asking themselves. What is the Democrats' word worth? We have a signed agreement, a signed letter. How dishonourable is it for the Democrats to now try to slide around and do something different on two occasions now. Not only did they try to do something different after the agreement was reached; the last time we debated there was another dealâand now there is another deal. The government is not going to deal on this kind of basis with the Democrats when they welsh on their word. It does indicate that the Democrats are untrustworthy when it comes to reaching an agreement and sticking to it. </para><para>Political parties, and particularly minor parties in this place, need to be able to honour their agreements or no-one will want to deal with them. Nobody will want to deal with them if they welsh on their deal and do not stick to what they say they will do. Welshing on the dealâand I might just say this a little more broadlyâalso brings the Senate process into some disrepute. Over the last few weeks we have had some considerable debate about Senate reform and I think that everybody recognisesâand, indeed, democracy demandsâthat the winner in the political process does not take all. Indeed, it is appropriate on occasions that there be negotiations and compromise, and of course that is exactly what we do here in the Senate and we do it day after day.</para><para>It is a very different issue if, instead of negotiating about the government's policyâwhich was clearly taken to the election, voted on and budgeted for and which is a sensible, well thought out policyâyou get into this place and you find that you are negotiating about what a minor party see as something that they want to substitute. In other words, substituting their own policy preferences is hardly what negotiation in the Senate is all about. It does bring the whole process of proper scrutiny in this place into disrepute. It makes it impossible to negotiate if what you are negotiating is not the government's policy but a substitute policy that a minor party might seek.</para><para>I think it is not an enviable reputation to have in this place that your word cannot be trusted. I do hope that the Democrats will listen very intently to this. I think, and I will continue to think, that there are opportunities for sensible and very appropriate compromises to be done on legislation with people who are honourable after you have reached an agreement. I do hope that this is just an aberration and that by the time this debate comes to a conclusion the Democrats will have come to their senses.</para><para>Thirdly, the real disappointment in this matter is for those people waiting for these bills to be passed. People on low incomes and people who would otherwise have no real incentive or opportunity to save for their retirement should get the lion's share of this package and the Democrats are prepared to put that in danger in relation to a principle that does not even arise in the context of these particular bills. The Democrats appear to be prepared to jeopardise these benefits that are going to flow to a great number of Australians for a principle that simply does not arise in the context of these debates.</para><para>It is not a very efficient way to run the Senate to try to deal with these kinds of amendments on the run. Lest it be said that the government is simply being stubborn about this, I just want to put on the record that the failure of the Senate to pass the consequential amendments in the way in which they have now been tabled here for our debate creates many problems. They includeâbut they are not limited toâthe fact that the co-contributions will be taxable contributions for funds. This will reduce the value of the co-contribution by the 15 per cent contributions tax. That is hardly an outcome that was intended.</para><para>It also affects the contribution paid directly to a person, for example a recent retiree. The co-contribution will be taxed in that person's hands. Was that an outcome that was wanted? Some Commonwealth public servants and Defence Force personnel will not be able to receive the co-contributions into their employer funds. Non-working spouses and non-working children could potentially qualify for the rebate using contributions that may be sourced from assets shifted from their spouse. The existing rebate will not be repealed and will continue to be paid, potentially providing a double benefit to recipients. Whilst the Democrats have said they think that is a great idea, playing Robin Hood in here is hardly a very good way to make policy. </para><para>The co-contribution scheme administration for superannuation funds may require an overhaul of reporting arrangements at a significant cost to industry. I would have thought that would not be a desirable outcome. People could not use the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal for the purposes of complaining about their fund's reporting of contributions for co-contribution calculations. It would potentially require the ATO to establish new arrangements for unsuccessful co-contribution payments as the Australian tax office should not use the superannuation holding accounts reserve as a last resort.</para><para>So it is pretty obvious why the government has opposed these amendments. Even if you look at the amendment that is now being proposed by the Democrats, it is not a very clean and not a very efficient way to do it because it only deals with the taxation of and eligibility for the co-contribution payments. In other words, the Democrat amendmentâthat is, the latest amendment todayâdoes not deal with repeal of the tax offset so a double benefit is still payable. The payments to public servants and defence personnel employer funds are not dealt with. There is still a problem with allowing the Australian tax office to use SHAR as a last resort for co-contribution payments. Allowing the complaints tribunal to be used by members is also an issue.</para><para>So it is not very efficient to be moving an amendment of this kind that simply seeks to retain some advantage, as some kind of leverage against the government, without looking at what you are really trying to do. It really does bring the whole Senate process into disrepute. There is no reason why these consequential amendments should be supported at all. The Democrats may yet be saved from themselves on this amendment; it is yet to be seen how the Senate votes. If it does pass without the amendmentsâLabor's mischievous amendments, the Greens' amendments and the Democrats' amendmentsâit will be no credit to the Democrats who have now, single-handedly it would seem, been prepared to shoot themselves in the foot over this issue and to welsh on their agreement at this point.</para><para>In the few minutes that I have before somebody else has a go, I want to reiterate that the government's position in relation to these bills is crystal clear and always has been. There is no possible discrimination in relation to reduction of the surcharge or eligibility for a co-contribution. If you are an eligible person for these benefits, you are eligible no matter what your family arrangements are. I think Senator Cherry has pretty much conceded throughout the debate we have had on this that issues to do with interdependency are very complexâlet us not fool ourselves about this. A moment's reflection would reveal that the issue has cross-portfolio implications for Defence and Attorney-General's, for the public sector and for judges, and it has significant implications for taxation.</para><para>It does need very careful and very clear appraisal. People can sit in this chamber and say what they like. You can have any kind of wish list, but when you are in government you have to be responsible for the people you make legislation for, be absolutely certain about the consequences of the legislation and make sure that the legislation has the intended policy effect. This is certainly not the time and place for stunts of any kind. It is far too important for the people of Australiaâfor those who have been waiting for a co-contribution, and to get some of the pressure off the surcharge so that we can all get on with saving for our futures. It is an absolute disgrace that we are still having this debate weeks after we reached an agreement. The government will not be supporting this amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>16796</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thought I had been a bit tough on the Australian Democrats! We are faced with the fairly extraordinary situation in the Senate chamber where, according to Senator Coonan, we have a signed deal between the government and the Australian DemocratsâI assume they are Senator Cherry's and Senator Bartlett's signatures on the bottom of this signed dealâyet Senator Coonan has now accused the Democrats on at least four or five occasions of `welshing' on this deal. She said that the Democrats are `untrustworthy' and that their word cannot be trusted. They are pretty scathing criticisms of a political party that has just entered into a dealâsigned, sealed but not deliveredâin respect of the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, which we are discussing. I would like a copy of this signed deal to be tabled in the Senate. It has not been presented publicly yet.</para></talk.start><para>I thought it was interesting that Senator Coonan at least had the honestyâdespite the fact that on at least two occasions I have pressed Senator Cherry on this issueâto disclose that in the discussions on this package Senator Cherry did not raise the issue of same-sex couples. He did not raise it in negotiations. We will now have a test in the Senate. The government has accused the Democrats of welshing on the deal; we will see what they do. I hope the Democrats do not welsh on the attempts to remove same-sex discrimination. We are going to put it to the test and attempt to remove the discrimination that applies in respect of superannuation and same-sex couples.</para><para>Senator Coonan made a plea to the Senate that the issues of same-sex couples and discrimination in superannuationâand issues that generally deal with interdependenceâare complex. I agree with that; they are complex. But what positive steps have the Liberal government taken to even start to address these issues? Not one. If it is not in this bill, when will it be? I have challenged Senator Coonan in previous weeks to at least give some indication of what the government intends to do with this issue. She can claimâI do not accept itâthese two superannuation bills have nothing to do with discrimination in respect of same-sex couples. If we accept thatâand I do notâwhat is the government proposing to do in respect of the discrimination against same-sex couples in their so-called choice of super? What is the government proposing to do on the splitting of superannuation contributions for couples? We need a deal on those two measures fairly soon. I look forward to dealing with them.</para><para>Some 27 years ago, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper of Friday, 19 September, apparently Senator Coonan, who was then a fiery young solicitor, was shoulder to shoulder with the gay rights movement demanding equal superannuation treatment for same-sex couples. That was 27 years ago. Here is the minister today and she has not even indicated that she has done one thing in 27 years, despite the fact that she is now the Assistant Treasurer of the country. She, along with her Liberal Party colleaguesâand we know the position of The Nationalsâhas done nothing about it. There has been not one word of reassurance on future legislationânot even the fallback position of some sort of inquiry. There has been absolutely nothingânot one thing. So I hope the Senate votes to reject the Liberal government's message, which we will be voting on shortly, and insists that now is the time: this is an appropriate bill in which to remove the discrimination against same-sex couples. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>16797</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will try to be reasonably brief, because I think it is about time we voted on this issue. I shall try not to make it personal, although this is obviously a matter of some game playing on behalf of the government and various other political parties, and maybe that is what they feel they need to do. </para></talk.start><para>This government has a record of breaking agreement after agreement including written agreements, agreements given to the Senate, commitments given to the Senate, commitments given to the Australian publicâit would take me the rest of the day to go through the litany of agreements that this government has made and certainly the rest of my 15 minutes here to go through the ones that it has broken with the Democrats. So for this government to suggest that it is appalling for another party not to keep to an agreement and to complain about any approach the Democrats have taken to reach agreement, frankly, it is hard to take the government seriously.</para><para>Nonetheless, what the Democrats do take seriously is keeping our agreements. We have indicated repeatedly that, while we are sticking to our agreement, we are also looking for the opportunity to further build on that agreement. This occurred via what I would have to say was an unexpected development in that, while Labor has consistently opposed Democrat amendments in this place on recognition of same-sex couples under superannuation, the Democrat amendments now have their support. That took us by surprise because opposition had been the consistent approach for many years and had been repeated by the Labor Party as recently as June. But, when the door opened and the opportunity appeared, we very keenly embraced it and sought to see whether it presented opportunities to finally move things forward for the gay and lesbian community who, whilst having had significant advances at state level in the removal of discrimination, have certainly been frustrated by many years of lack of movement at the federal level.</para><para>I certainly do not see that as welshing on an agreement; I see it as the Democrats doing our duty not only to get a good outcome for low-income earners but to explore what, as I have said, was an unexpected although welcome opportunity to seriously address discrimination against people in interdependent relationships, including same-sex couples. Maybe the government feel that they need to say those things. I and other members of the Democrats have been extremely open and frank with the government about our wishes in a range of areas but, if the government are seriously saying that their view now is that this brings the whole Senate process into disrepute and they will not be able to negotiate on this issue seriously, that will be their loss. It will be a loss for the Australian people as well. If they are just going to say, `We're not going to talk to anybody now and you can take it or leave it on everything', that is the sort of obstructive approach that we have seen in some other areasâalthough not obviously in this areaâfrom the government. Until now, the current minister has indicated a willingness to negotiate, otherwise we would not have the gains that we have achieved for low-income earners before us today for debate. But basically the ball is in the government's court on this issue, as it always is on issues that are to be considered by the Senate and the parliament. </para><para>I do not want to get sidetracked today on the debate about the role and powers of the Senate. Senator Coonan personally has made some comments on that in other contexts over a number of years and again quite recently in Brisbane a few days ago. That is a separate debate and the Democrats' views are pretty clear on that as well. We will leave the debate on whether or not things should change for another day, but the reality now is that the Australian people have elected a Senate that does not give the government absolute power and the government need to negotiate and get the support of other senators if they want to get legislation through. That is the way I think it should be and clearly it is the way the Australian people think it should be. If the government do not want to play ball with the system the Australian people have chosen, as I have said, it would be their loss and it would be a loss for the Australian people, but I do not think that is the approach the government would take. I certainly hope it is not, not just for their sake but also for the sake of the Australian people.</para><para>Although Senator Cherry does not need defendingâand I do not want to speak for himâI think it is undeniably clear what the Democrats' views are on recognition of same-sex couples, not just in superannuation but in just about every area of federal law that you can think of. It is an issue that we raise regularly with virtually every bill, although whether or not those words got before the current minister in the context of this current package of bills I cannot say. As I have said earlier, given what until recently had been a very consistent position from the Labor Party not to support any amendments in this regard, it hardly gave us much leverage until now. This is a welcome and, I hope, consistent development in that it does give the Senate extra leverage on these issues. It would be remiss in the extreme for the Democrats, given our record and consistent commitment to the issue of removal of discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, not to explore those opportunities given the apparent change in Senate dynamics. We will continue to do so in the context of this current debate and also when future opportunities arise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>16798</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to comment on a few things which we have heard today and which I think have not been covered or perhaps need to be covered again. There is one key point I would like to make at this stage because it has been said often in recent weeks in the media and in here today from all sides of the chamber that this has regrettably, either deliberately or inadvertently, come down to an issue perhaps of low-income earners versus same-sex couples. I want to make the point those people could be one and the same. I know I have said this before but I think it is worth repeating: you cannot quarantine low-income earners as if they are somehow separate and distinct and different from same-sex couples. There are many same-sex couples who themselves are low-income earners. It would be regrettableâindeed, quite nastyâif we were to reach the point where there was a nasty piece of wedge politics playing out here, where the lesbian and gay community was being set up as a whipping post for those people who might feel frustration at this bill not passing and thereby providing opportunities for low-income earners. That would be regrettable. I think we need to acknowledge that that outcome should be avoided and that there is no particular distinction between same-sex couples and low-income earners.</para></talk.start><para>It is a strong mythâand I have spoken on this in other forumsâthat somehow gay and lesbian people are all wealthy or privileged. You may have heard of the notion of the so-called `pink dollar'. I think the gay community is itself much to blame for promoting that mythology. But academic research, particularly a recent comprehensive study into poverty in Ireland, showed that there were significant levels of poverty amongst the lesbian and gay community as a result of discrimination and disadvantage in financial institutions and in employment opportunities. I say to the minister: there would be many low-income earners who would be lesbian or gay and in same-sex relationships but who would still be very passionate about these amendments being insisted upon and the bill being passed in that form. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>âThey are entitled to the co-contributionâyou know that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>86X</name.id><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name></talker><para>âYes, I accept that, but this is where I think you are wrong, Minister: the discrimination kicks in when, at some point in the future, those people in same-sex relationships who have taken advantage of this legislation, should it proceed, then try and bequeath their fund to their surviving partner. That is when the discrimination kicks in, so it is a nonsense to say that this bill does not relate to discrimination because it does. It is not just specifically quarantined to individuals because those individuals may be in relationships or may go on to be in relationships and at some time down the track, whether it is in 10, 20 or 30 years, they may want to leave their co-contribution funds. If they have been putting in $1,000 a year for many years and having that matched by the government, they will have a nice little nest egg. If they should be killed in an industrial accident or some such thing, it is then that the discrimination kicks in. Yes, it is true, as I have said already, that there are few, if any, examples where a same-sex partner has ultimately been unable to leave their money, but the tax impost applies. That is where the unfairness comes in, because it is a tax on being gay. That is where I take issue again with Senator Harradine, who argued that the existing discrimination against same-sex couples in a broad range of superannuation laws is not really discriminating against one group but, rather, advantaging another. As far as I am concerned that is just heterosexist supremacy. That is just like saying the government of South Africa was not really discriminating against blacks; it was just upholding the rights and privileges of the whites. It is not acceptable.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is not looking good, I must say, for the government to now indicate that it may, some time down the track, look at perhaps dealing with these issues in a broader interdependency categoryâsomething which I would like to seeâwhile at the same time Mr Mal Brough, speaking only yesterday and in relation to Defence Force issues, argued in favour of discrimination against same-sex couples in the military in areas of resourcing and accommodation. When pressed on this matter by the journalist from the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline>, he argued the point that the government was committed to the definitions of marriage and de facto status that exist in legislation. There is absolutely no sign, even as of yesterday, that cabinet is prepared to move on this. As to the indication from the minister now that it might: forgive me if I take that with a pinch of salt. If there were some kind of stronger indication from the minister or, better yet, from the Prime Minister, that would be different.</para><para>I also want to make a point on Senator Harradine's argument about this particular discrimination being there to advantage marriage. Consider the nonsense of that statement when we are talking about a partnership where one person is dead. If you have left your superannuation death benefit or reversionary pension to your surviving partner then you are dead; one person from that relationship is gone. A marriage where one partner is dead is really not a very good marriage; it is not a very sustainable marriage. So it is a complete nonsense to argue that death benefits are structured to advantage marriage. They are nothing of the sort. </para><para>Senator Boswell has said in this placeâhe is not here now; this was in a previous contributionâthat his electorate did not want this, his constituency did not want this, the people of Queensland did not want this. I am paraphrasing and do not mean to put words into his mouth, but he argued strongly that his electorate was opposed to this. I would make the point that at a state level, in his electorate of Queensland, this has already happened, not just in superannuation but in a broad range of antidiscrimination measures and partnership recognitions, so there has effectively been a referendum on this issue broadly across his electorate. He cannot present the argument that the people of Queensland do not want this because they have had no particular objection to the current Beattie government and the previous Goss government having moved on these areas.</para><para>I feel strongly too about making the point that while I am genuinely delighted that Labor have budged on this issue, I regret what I would argue are the cynical circumstances under which this has happened. While it is good to see Labor now moving these amendments and actually uttering the words `same-sex couples' in this place, we should not forget that it was Labor which introduced these anti-gay measures; it was Labor which cemented, during the Keating years, the discriminatory provisions in superannuation. So I would ask them not to be too pious about this.</para><para>I am keen to make the point also that superannuation is not the only area of discrimination against same-sex couples and that for many in the gay and lesbian community it is the one which least concerns them. But, for a variety of social and political reasons, I guess super has risen within the gay and lesbian community, through the myriad of problems and dilemmas and ranges of discrimination, to be a kind of icon issue. I think this is principally for two reasons. Firstly, it is an issue which, within the community, really came to the fore during the mid-eighties and early nineties when so many gay men were dying from HIV-AIDS, so it was then that they were confronted and our community was more confronted with the discrimination that does exist. Secondly, superannuation is compulsory, so you can understand people being affronted and concerned about having to sign up to a compulsory superannuation system which then discriminated against them.</para><para>You would have to say also, I think, that the gay and lesbian community have been extraordinarily gracious in as much as for a long time, rightly or wrongly, this is pretty much the only issue on which they have asked for and in some cases demanded reform. There is no great push in all the other areas, although there really ought to be. That does mean, once again, that we need comprehensive universal reform. But let us not forget that this discrimination still continues in the Defence Force, the Federal Police, taxation, social security, immigration, veterans' affairs and industrial relations. I will not go on but every piece of Commonwealth legislation that deals with relationships discriminates against same-sex couples, and some of that discrimination is really appalling. We have heard much about what that is in super but from my observation some of the worst areas are immigration and the Defence Force. So it seems incredibly unfair to me that we have heard in various contributions from coalition senators and the minister that this is not the appropriate bill or this is not the issue on which these issues should be fought out. I find it strange that, if the suggestion inherent in that is that it should be done in other bills, then God knows there is enough to do. </para><para>I come back again to my plea to the government and to the opposition to allow time to properly debate the Democrat Sexuality and Gender Identity Discrimination Bill, which goes to the heart of this and other issues. That bill would flush out all those issues so that we would not have to deal with them on a piecemeal basis. When Senator Sherry has argued on 11 previous occasions that Labor does not want an ad hoc response to this kind of discrimination but a more global view, I point again to the Albanese bill and now the Plibersek bill in the House of RepresentativesâMs Plibersek's bill deals with a discrete piece of immigration lawâwhich are in fact illustrations of ad hoc reform. They are not in any way comprehensive reform. As Senator Cherry pointed out earlier, Mr Albanese's bill is quite inadequate in a range of areas.</para><para>I am also reminded that the minister said that there was a deal and that the deal should be adhered to. There is some merit in that. But I too remember the Prime Minister going to the election two polls ago saying that he wanted to govern for all Australians. I do not see that reflected in the legislation. More recently he went to the polls campaigning on a fairer and more tolerant Australia. I do not see that reflected there. I think the Prime Minister has welched on his commitment to govern for all and on his commitment for a fairer and more tolerant Australia. If we are serious about governing for all then you cannot exclude some people in the community. If you do want a fairer and more tolerant Australia then it is possible and appropriate to look at both low-income earners and same-sex couples, keeping in mind that they are often much the same thing.</para><para>The amendments before us are appropriate. They are not outrageous or unacceptable in my view. Every state and territory with the exception of the Northern Territory has moved on this, although I note with interest and approval that even now the assembly of the Northern Territory is about to embark on some sweeping reforms in that jurisdiction to address this and other issues including an equalising of the age of consent and broader partnership and antidiscrimination laws. You could argueâI wouldâthat there has effectively been a national referendum on these issues because every state and territory has or will have addressed these issues within the next few months. Plunging into my memory, there has never been, to the best of my knowledge, any electoral backlash on any state or territory government which has progressed on this reform. That, I think, is the challenge for the governmentâto explain why it is that it insists so strongly, so fervently and so militantly on this discrimination. I simply do not understand the argument I heard again today from the minister who said that no cases of discrimination had come across her desk. I think they were the words the minister used. If it is the case, and I am prepared to accept that the minister may not have had correspondence on thisâI certainly haveâthat discrimination is not happening, how could you possibly object to that principle being cemented into law? Why would you instead take the reverse argument and argue on the one hand approvingly, presumably, that this discrimination is not happening but then fervently campaign against any possibility to cement that in law? If it is the case that it is not happening now, perhaps through loophole, why would you not accept the argument that it might happen in the future? It certainly can. The more important point is that it is happening now.</para><para>I do not recall whether I said in an earlier contribution a few weeks ago that only a matter of weeks ago I was contacted by a woman in Melbourne whose name escapes me and whose female partner of seven years had just died. Her partner had been a long-term public servantâI am not sure whether it was in the Commonwealth or state public service; I understood it to be in the Commonwealth Public Serviceâand, while she did inherit with little difficulty her partner's death benefit, there was a 33 per cent or 35 per cent tax impost on that, which led her to phone me, pleading with me as to what could be done about this. I said there are only two things you can do about this: firstly, raise the issue as best you can to the extent that you are prepared with the relevant authorities and the relevant governments and, secondly, get in contact with a state based lawyerâI nominated oneâand see whether there is any legal avenue that could be pursued. But there ain't.  </para><para>The only other thing we can do is continue to champion the cause in the parliament. I am very proud of the role that the Democrats have taken in doing that. I do not think it is unreasonable of me to suggest that one of the key reasons we are having this debate, one of the key reasons Labor has budged on this issue and one of the key reasons the government is showing some slight indication of moving is that we have been dogged in thisânot just me but my party as a whole, politically. It would be fantastic to get resolution on this not just for gay and lesbian people but because it is a human rights issue and it makes Australia a better place for all of us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>16802</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Bartlett, on behalf of the Democrats, has at last declared to the Senate what the Democrats intend to do. The Democrats and this Liberal government intend to support the message and deliver an exclusive tax cut to high-income earners on their superannuation who earn more than $96,000 a year. The effect of the vote will be an exclusive tax cut to high-income earners who earn more than $96,000 a year. Where is the tax cut for the 8Â½ million Australians who earn less than $96,000 a year? Where is the tax cut for lower- and middle-income Australia? A Democrat-Liberal government deal to deliver an exclusive tax cut guaranteed to all of those who earn $96,000 a year is going to be passed by the Senate. </para></talk.start><para>The Democrats have argued that this is a balanced package. Low-income earners earning up to $27,500 a year may receive $1,000 from the government. We know from the Liberal government's own figures that only one in 10 Australians earning less than $27,500 a year get a benefit from this package whereas all the high-income earners earning more than $96,000 a year get an exclusive tax cut. Australians earning between $40,000 and $96,000 a year do not get one cent. That is not a fair and balanced approach. To cap it all off, the Democrats are going to agree to the Liberal government's message to remove discrimination against same-sex couples in Australia. </para><para>For the reasons I have outlined, the Labor Party will not be supporting these messages. This is an unfair package, an unfair deal. It is unfair in the dollars that are delivered to the groups I have outlined. When this government was elected in 1996, the total tax collection on superannuation was approximately $1.6 billion a year; in the last financial year it was $5.3 billion. Since the Liberal government has been in power, the extra tax collected from Australian superannuation has now reached $3.7 billion a year, and the Liberal government and the Democrats are proudly announcing that they are going to give back $400 million a year. They have collected an extra $3.7 billion a year in tax and they are going to very generously give backâI say that somewhat sarcasticallyâ$400 million. That is not a fair approach. The outcome that we will now inevitably proceed to vote on is not fair. The Labor Party is not supporting it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>16803</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appeal to the Labor Party to pass the <inline ref="R1815">Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, the <inline ref="R1816">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1812">Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. </inline>This legislation will advantage low-income workers.

When dealing with the question of same-sex partners, I have been scrupulous to avoid any reference to the personal lifestyles of participants in the debate. I invite honourable senators and others interested to look at my latest contribution at 1.46 p.m. today. Senator Greig in his speech brought my wife into the debateâand it is the second time that he has personalised the debate. My recollection is that Senator Greig asked why my wife should get the benefits of my superannuation yet his same-sex partner may not. I do not want to comment on that; I do not know the circumstances. This ultimately will be for the trustee and the appeals tribunal. But I do know about my wife: she has never done any paid work in her life. She has been involved in raising 13 kids and does marvellous community work and all the rest of it. I reckon that, if I cark it, she is entitled to my superannuation, but I will leave it at that.

The bills deal with eligibility, and a gay or lesbian person is just as eligible as a heterosexual person. I can say to the Senate with absolute confidence that there is no discrimination in these bills.

I do not want it to be said that I have made some commitment along those lines, in case there is some problem with the schedule, but I can say to the Senate that my attention to choice in the bill and to issues to do with choice has been very much exercised. The bill is at a very advanced stage and ready to be introduced as soon as possible. I think it is appropriate to put that on the record. Certainly there is no reason to hold these three bills up.

In relation to the last vote, given that we have further votes coming up, it seems clear to the Democrats that there was confusion in terms of the count. As senators all noted, we had an extension to ring the bells for four minutes for the sake of certain people who were outside the chamber. No-one extra appeared. The explanation, for those who may be wondering, is that Senator Harris was not present for the count. He may be legitimately abstainingâI do not knowâor he may have other commitments. But his not being here should have meant an odd count rather than a tied vote. That concerns the Democrats in terms of what the actual will of the Senate is, and that was the reason we wanted to reject the committee's report, and to go back into committee to figure out what was actually going on. Either way, to flag this for future votes, we want to make sure we get those numbers right. I do not know whether the senator was legitimately abstaining or not, but if there is one person who is not paired and who is not here then we should have an odd count, not an even count. That is part of the concern the Democrats have, but we are not seeking to revisit the previous votes; we are just making that point.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>16807</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust for the record, the Democrats will not insist on these amendments because we think the amendments have very little consequence.

On that basis, given this amendment is a fairly trivial one, we do not think it appropriate to insist on it at this stage.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>16807</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWould the minister mind giving some clarification of the connection between this amendment and the purpose of the bill?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>16807</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank Senator Watson for the question.

An eligible individual is an eligible individual irrespective of whether they are gay, lesbian, in some family relationship or indeed any other combination of same-sex couples. If you are an eligible individual under co-contributions legislation you are eligible. There is no possible or conceivable impact on your eligibility whether or not you are in a same-sex couple.

At an earlier time in this debate we did canvass in some very great detail the structure of the co-contribution package and provided an analysis of who would benefit and who would actually receive it. I will just briefly recapture some of those points and, if Senator Harradine needs to revisit some of this information, of course we would be in a position to do that.  </para></talk.start><para>The Treasury has estimated that 540,000 people will receive the co-contribution in the 2004-05 budget year. That is a very good start because the co-contribution was designed to replace the tax offset with a much more generous measure. It is targeted at low-income earners and it is a very good way in which to deliver a benefit to those who otherwise might not have the inclination, ability or the incentive to make some contribution for their retirement. It is obviously targeted at helping those who otherwise may have no benefit other than the social security safety net. Clearly, it is in everyone's interest and, as an ageing population, it is in Australia's interests that as many Australians as possible be encouraged to save. I do think it is fair to say though that because this is replacing the tax rebate the co-contribution was not targeted at the whole population. The measures are aimed at reducing very serious disincentives faced by those able to save for their retirement and at boosting the superannuation savings of lower-income earners.</para><para>Earlier in the debate it was said that there are others who do not get the benefit of the co-contribution because it phases out at $40,000. I want to remind the Senateâand I think it is a very important point that Senator Harradine has raisedâthat there are other elements of the government's superannuation package that would be available to those on other income levels. For example, there is the splitting of superannuation contributions between spouses, the continuing superannuation contribution to age 75, the increase in the fully deductible for the self-employed, the choice of superannuationâwhich is very importantâand portability. This government is very exercised about providing benefits for Australians to reduce some of the disincentives and to encourage all Australians to save for their retirement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>16809</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat last statement from the minister is absolute rubbish. She is claiming that having passed an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners earning more than $96,000âthey are all guaranteed a tax reduction on their superannuationâwe now presumably are going to pass a low-income earners co-contribution for Australians earning up to $40,000. It is voluntary, so we know from the government's own figures that one in 10 Australians earning less than $40,000 will benefit. We support that, albeit it is a very watered-down version of Labor's. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âWe support it, Senator Harradine, and I might point out that the government is delivering $200 million after 2007-08. But those Australians earning between $40,000 and $96,000âand there are a lot of them; there are at least 2Â½ millionâdo not get a cent from this package. It is incorrect to talk about the deductibility for the self-employed, the splitting of superannuation contributions and contributing to super up to age 75. Those things are not in any significant way benefiting the millions of Australians who earn between $40,000 and $96,000 a year. And they are not in any significant way benefiting the nine out of 10 Australians who earn less than $40,000 who, on the government's own figures, will not benefit from this package.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue at point is the Senate insisting on the amendment that we passed in respect of same-sex couples. The Labor Party supports the amendment that has previously been passed by the Senate and we support the low-income earners co-contribution. But let us have an air of reality about it. Senator Ian Campbell in a previous incarnation claimed that this was going to turn Australians into millionaires. That is absolute nonsense. We know that about one in 10 low-income Australians will benefit because of the problem they have with disposable income to save, and we know about a guaranteed tax cut for high-income earners earning more than $96,000 a year. </para><para>So the package is not fair and balanced because the government has deliberately combined the introduction of this measure with their exclusive tax cut. It has not been presented to the Senate by itself. I conclude my remarks there by drawing the contrast with the government's favoured treatment to high-income earners who will all get the tax cut. Presumably, this measure will pass the Senate. The one in 10 low-income earners will pick up a benefit, and those who earn between $40,000 and $96,000 do not get a cent from this package. It was nonsense of the minister to claim that those other measures she outlined significantly benefit the millions of Australians earning between $40,000 and $96,000, because they do not.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coonan's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator J.J.

They are very crucial.

This is the important change, consequent upon the changes inherent in this legislation, that the majority in this chamber have been insisting upon. We must not demur to the House of Representatives, which effectively means the government, on this matter. </para></talk.start><para>I will not go through the issues again except to say that there are hundreds of thousands of Australians being discriminated against in superannuation by the lack of amendments such as these. These amendments reach out to superannuation schemes in the private and public sectors, although not to those superannuation schemes covering politiciansâthat will be for a later dayâand they get rid of the discrimination against people who are dependants. We have had those debates. It is extremely important that this discrimination end. It is a very deep discrimination that is being practised by the Howard government here.</para><para>I appeal to the Independents, who are crucial in this matter, to stand their ground on this. It is very easy to say, `The government has got a package here which is going to help some people who are on low incomes.' We do not deny that. There are going to be many more people on low incomes who are not going to be helped, many more. I have argued before that it is people on low incomes who are in relationships with people on high incomes who are going to best be able to take advantage of the legislation. Nevertheless, we support the copayments; we oppose the cuts to taxes to the rich but we are alsoâand this is a time-honoured positionâalong with the Democrats, vehemently in favour of ending the discrimination.</para><para>The Labor Party has chosen this moment to support the amendments and we have a suite of amendments here from the three parties on the opposition side, which must be insisted upon by the Senate. This is extremely important legislative innovation coming from the Senate. This is why we say that the Senate is so important. The government has failed on this matter. We are insisting upon it, we have brought up; it is the government that is being obstructive and that is why we want to reform the House of Representatives. What we are doing here is insisting and there are many people who are dependent upon that. I note that our friends in the Democrat party have said that the government is moving on this. Here is where the government has to move and there is no way we should relent on the matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>16811</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will be insisting on the amendments to this bill. We note that there are two sets of amendments: there are the set of amendments that we have moved and the amendments which the Greens have moved. For the simplicity of the debateâalthough it looks as if we are going to loseâwe will insist on all of the amendments. The key point for us is that the amendments we are moving today are, in our view, landmark amendments. We have moved on 11 previous occasions to recognise the issue of same-sex couples in superannuation and other areas of law and, on 11 occasions, we have lost. </para></talk.start><para>On this particular occasion, we have moved not just on the issue of same-sex couples but also on the issue of interdependent relationships. That actually picks up a very important area of law that currently is almost there in superannuation and tax law but not quite. At the moment under superannuation and tax law if a person can prove partial dependence on another then they are entitled to their superannuation on death and they are entitled to tax concessions relating to that. Partial dependence under superannuation and tax law has been found to require only token dependence or token payments. </para><para>The next level is what we call interdependent relationshipsâpeople who are living together who have made a genuine emotional and financial commitment to each other but are not necessarily financially dependent on each other. These relationships are recognised at the moment under the Migration Act, and they are recognised under state law in Tasmania and New South Wales as appropriate relationships for the purposes of property law. It seems appropriate to us that they should be recognised also in superannuation and tax law. As we said earlier in the debate, and I do not want to go through the arguments again other than very briefly, this is about people's property and it is about trying to decide when and under what circumstances people should be entitled to leave their property to whom they choose to leave it. In our view, if a person has made a commitment to someone in terms of an interdependent relationship then they should be entitled to leave their superannuation to that person and that person should be entitled to receive that superannuation tax free on the same basis as all other dependants.</para><para>It is a fairly straightforward issue. In her earlier contribution, the minister said that it is terribly complicated and difficult and all the rest of it. It is not. It is a logical extension of the current law. To shift from partial financial dependenceâwhich is recognised even in the message which came back from the Houseâto interdependency is a very small step. In fact, when you read the message from the House it implies that financial interdependence is, in fact, picked up by the current law. But the case law suggests otherwise and, certainly, the rulings of the tax office suggest otherwise. That is why the Democrats have moved these amendments and that is why we are insisting on them.</para><para>We do not think it is a huge issue. We do not think it is a deal breaking matter; we never thought it was a deal breaking matter. We think it is a small clarification of an area of law that causes significant hardship to a small but important group of Australians, and those are people in same-sex relationships or interdependent relationships. This could pick up the situation of family members who are in a genuine relationshipâwho are living together and sharing their lives with each otherâand it could pick up the situation of same-sex relationships. It is an important amendment because it is extending the law just a little step further.</para><para>I did note that the minister indicated she may agree to canvass this issue in the choice of funds debate. As the minister would be aware, the Democrats raised this issue in the choice of funds debate last time we dealt with it, and the bills fell over on this particular issue. She would be aware that I have raised this issue with her personally in relation to the choice of funds debate on several occasions over the last six months. She would be aware of the views of the Democratsâwe believe this issue should be dealt with and we do not believe it is a huge, significant, dramatic change to taxation or superannuation arrangements. It builds on current lawâit simply extends that current law and makes it a little bit fairer in who it applies to. But for those people who are actually affected by this it is a very significant change. I do not think it is going to cost the government much in tax. It does cost the government in lost tax benefits, but I think they are inappropriate taxesâtaxes on death benefits. The whole notion of taxing on death benefits is something the government needs to look at again more fundamentally. The other amendments which we are dealing with also deal with definitions of same-sex couples, which we have moved on 11 previous occasions. </para><para>I do want to deal briefly with the argument raised by the minister earlier in the debate about whether we are welshing on a dealâand there is an issue of discrimination against the Welsh, which one of our Welsh staff members asked to be noted for the record. We reject the view that we are falling away from a deal. The amendments we are pursuing here on interdependency areâin terms of cost in the budget, people affected and the already existing structure of recognising partially dependent relationshipsânot a huge advance. The government can make that small step to recognise these people at small cost to itselfâin fact, at no cost to itself. Yet for the people affected by this it is a huge advance. It would give an enormous amount of confidence to people who are facing uncertainty about whether they may or may not have their relationships recognised if they die. That uncertainty which breeds in the sector has to be dealt with.</para><para>This could actually improve confidence in superannuation. It could ensure that the surcharge cut and the co-contributions actually are of full value to all Australians, regardless of the sort of family relationship they are in. It could ensure that they have confidence whilst they are willing the superannuation. If they want to will it to somebody else then they can be confident that that will be recognised and respected by the government, the Taxation Commissioner and the superannuation fund trustees. From that point of view the Democrats will be insisting upon these amendments. I would ask Independent Senators Lees and Murphy, and in particular Senator Harradine, to seriously consider insisting upon these. </para><para>We have now passed the co-contributions bill and the surcharge bill. The deal we have done is now 95 per cent through the Senate. What is being dealt with in the consequential amendments bill are literally consequential matters. They are the tax treatment of the co-contributions, the abolition of the low-income earners rebate and some arrangements in respect of payments of co-contributions in more complicated cases. We have until 30 June next year to sort out these matters. The co-contribution does not flow into people's pockets until the next financial year. There is no urgency to deal with these matters here today.</para><para>The Democrats are committed to delivering this deal in full. But we want to ensure that the government is put under maximum pressure to actually deal with the issue of interdependency. We recognise that probably the most appropriate place to deal with that may end up being the choice of funds legislation, as the minister suggested, in two weeks time. But we should put maximum pressure on the government to ensure that those amendments are dealt with when that choice of funds bill comes around. That, to me, includes trying to use what leverage we have got in this situation to push that deal along a little bit further. That means certainly tying up the abolition of the low-income earners rebateâthe $10 million penalty clause, as I call itâin this bill.</para><para>From that point of view I think it is reasonable to insist upon these amendments. The government can proceed to plan and superannuation funds can proceed to plan on the basis that this whole package will apply from 1 July, because the surcharge cut and the co-contributions bill are through. They can certainly rely on the commitment given by the Democrats here in this debate that by 1 July next year the rest of this package will be sorted out. If we put pressure on the government through this bill, through the choice of funds bill and through the spouse co-contributions bill then I believe we can reach a resolution on the issue of interdependency. I urge the Independents to seriously consider following the Democrats in insisting upon these very important amendments, because for that very small group of Australians who are affected these amendments are important and will reduce an enormous amount of pressure. From the point of view of cost to the government and extension of the current legal arrangements I believe the government can in fact cop the amendments that we are pursuing today. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>16814</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI believe the amendments should be insisted upon. I make a particular appeal this evening to Senators Harradine and Boswell, because in previous contributions both of those senators have made mention of other non-conjugal relationships which they believe have suffered discrimination under superannuation law. We have heard from Senator Harradine three, four or five times over the last few years talking about the scenario of maiden aunts and the discrimination that might apply there within superannuationâand he is right. We have heard also from Senator Boswell, who has talked about what happened following the tragic death of his son. The tax imposed on his late son's superannuation death benefits went, I understand, to his nephew. Senator Boswell is right.</para></talk.start><para>The interdependency amendments moved this evening as drafted by Senator Cherry and advocated by the Democrats would take care of that. They would address those particular non-conjugal relationships in a broader sense than has been addressed in the more specific amendments that go to the heart of same-sex couples, but all would be incorporated. In that sense, the Democrat amendments are doing little more than echoing the interdependency definition that currently exists and operates within the immigration act. I find it hard to believeâI find it nonsensicalâthat the government would vehemently argue against this interdependency definition on the grounds that it is not in the government's interest or ideological position to do so, when it currently operates effectively in immigration. In some ways what we are seeking to do is simply move that same definition across into superannuation.</para><para>We have heard from a Senate committee looking into discrimination against same-sex couples and others in this place. It was a committee that was heavily represented by the industry and superannuation funds. They have no difficulty with this reform. They embrace it and would support it if only the government would give the nod to it. In fact, it has been suggested to me that there is some discomfort within sections of the industry in that, while they are invariably making these death benefit payments to surviving same-sex partners, there is legal uncertainty with them in fact doing that. They would like certainty.</para><para>We have also had an independent report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which has investigated this issue and long advocated reform. The time to fix this is now. Human rights is always now. These amendments must be insisted upon. This is an issue the government must address and it is embarrassing in this day and age that the federal government continues its belligerence on this issue when every state and territory has addressed it, or is at least going to, and the matter at a state and territory jurisdictional level will be resolved in the next few weeks.</para><para>Limping behind that human rights reform which has largely swept the country is the Commonwealth, and it is time we caught up. We are one of very few Western countries that has no national antidiscrimination on the grounds of sexuality. We are the only Western democracy without a bill of rights. Both of those things would go some way towards addressing this issue but in the absence of those things it needs to be done on a case by case basis. This legislation provides us with but one opportunity to do that, and should be embraced.  </para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coonan's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator J.J.

As I understand it we are due to move immediately on to the debate on the sale of the remaining 51 per cent of Telstra so I think it is apposite and pertinent that I make some comments now. It is very important that people in this chamber understand that the government has just tabled the legislation committee's report into the sale of 51 per cent of Telstra. Now we are immediately moving on to debate the bill. If I were a member of the public listening here today or an Independent senatorâsuch as Senator Harradine or Senator Murphy, both of whom are in the chamberâI would be most perturbed about the process that has been undertaken. Independent senators, and maybe some other senators who do not have a fixed view with respect to this, have had no time at all to consider what is in this report before being immediately confronted with dealing with the legislation. I think most in the chamber would have a view with respect to this legislation but some may not and some may be considering whether they intend to support the government's legislation predicated on the legislation inquiry, on whether there are sufficient safeguards for rural and regional Australia, on what the government intends to do with the proceeds, and on what kind of process was undertaken with respect to the legislation.  </para><para>Anybody listening to the Senate needs to understand this: the report from the legislation committee has just been tabled. The government is insisting that we proceed immediately to debate the bill. This means there is no time for people to consider the content of the report. I point out at this point that there are two dissenting reports: one from the Democrats and one from Labor. The reality about a legislative process and the reality about committees is that the committee system is supposed to look at legislation in detail and then report to the Senate on its view with respect to the legislation. The government's view has not been impacted on one iota by the hearings that were undertaken and by the non-government comments in the report that has just been printed and tabled in the Senate. This is a perversion of the democratic process. It is not supposed to be how the Senate operates. The haste is, to say the least, unseemly. Even if a day had expired between the tabling of this report and the bringing on of the legislation, that would have been better than nothing.</para><para>I also point out that the legislation committee has tabled this report early. The legislation committee was not due to report until 30 October and all parties, with the best will in the world and generally being cooperative, have agreed to table it early. Why have we done that? The reason is that the government has no other legislation. Because we are a cooperative opposition and because we are keen not to play into the government's mistruths about the fact that the Senate is somewhat tardy on occasions, we have brought the report forward and we will agreeâbecause I know leave has to be soughtâto bring on the Telstra legislation for debate. Why are the opposition doing that? We are doing that because we are very clear on our position with respect to Telstra: we do not believe that one single share further should be sold.</para><para>With respect to the process, I believe it is an insult to the people of Australiaâto the 127 who took part<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>and to the many hundreds of thousands more who have strong views about the Telstra sale and who feel that the Senate undertakes a good role and that the scrutiny the Senate undertakes with respect to legislation is germane, is relevant, in this day and age. I believe that we have here effectively a contortion of the result. We will not be denying leaveâand I understand that the government has to seek leaveâto bring on the debate on the Telstra sale, but I point out the lack of time between the tabling of the report and the bringing on of the legislation: I think the legislation will be brought on when I sit down. What kind of democratic process is that? The views of the people who made those submissions, who had input into the report and who made the effort to come along to the hearings count not one jot as far as the government is concernedâjust as the two minority reports submitted by the Labor Party and the Democrats count not one jot. </para><para>The government may have no other legislation. That is fine. The government may have a major hole in its program. That is also fine. But to bring on a piece of legislation of this gravity without even a cursory 24-hour examination of the views of the people who made submissions, many of which are quoted in the report, is a total contortion of the democratic process. It is symptomatic of the government's attempt to rush this legislation through; it is symptomatic of the government's attempt to bury the issue of Telstra, to get it out of the way as quickly as it possibly can; and it is symptomatic of how out of touch the government isâparticularly the Nationals senators, none of whom participated in any hearings at all on the Telstra sale.</para><para>To those who are listening and to the Independents who may or may not be in the chamber I say that the government will have given you, by the time I sit down, 30 seconds for considerationâfor you to read and absorb the report and form your own views before the legislation is considered. I suspect that it will be called on virtually the moment I sit down. With those few comments I will sit down so that we can start debating the Telstra legislation, but on behalf of the Labor Party I put down a marker that we are not happy, and the people of Australia ought not to be happy, with the relative contempt with which the Senate has been treated in this matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>16817</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is quite a significant report, and I commend it to the Senate.

It deals with a very important issueâthe proposed sale of Telstra, a $30 billion plan by the government. What came through the evidence of those 168 submissions and the seven days of hearings was that the government has comprehensively failed to make out a public interest case for the sale of Telstra. The inquiry found that competition has not developed as extensively as was generally expected after full competition was introduced in 1997 and that various telecommunications markets are not yet effectively competitive. It found market failure and an imbalance in market power. It found that Australian household consumers are still paying too much for their services; that services are not equal between urban Australia and regional and rural Australia; that there are no future-proofing mechanisms to ensure meaningful outcomes; that Australia specific research and development is dissipating; that networks are not being developed and used to their full potential; that the current regulatory system needs improving; that there has been no independent, authoritative study of structural separation, despite such a study being recommended by the OECD and required under subclause 4(3) of the Competition Principles Agreement; and that this bill contains nothing that will improve competition but instead removes part 3 of the Telstra Corporation Act 1991, which gives the minister power to intervene in the public interest. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is also noteworthy that the evidence given to this inquiry dealt with the significant power Telstra has in respect of the customer access network and of the media market through its Foxtel partnership, particularly in regional markets, and through its control of the universal service obligation. The ACCC gave evidence to the committee that the bill will in no areas improve competition and instead will reduce the ability of government to monitor and intervene in market power abuse. Throughout the inquiry a compelling case was made for the implementation of a mechanism to future-proof rural and regional Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

Despite recommendations by the National Competition Council, the ACCC, the OECD and various other experts, the government has not yet explored the competitive advantages, costs and benefits of improving competition through means such as structural separation; nor has it responded to the report by the Australian Communications Authority on improving network reliability frameworks; nor, indeed, has it dealt with the issues of future proofing raised in a whole range of rural and business submissions. All the committee's evidence shows very clearly that the government has not made a clear case based on the public interest for selling Telstra and that a whole range of things will need to occur before the 80 per cent of Australians who are opposed to the sale of Telstra come round to the government's point of view.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Steve (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hutchins)</inline>âThe question is that the Senate take note of the report.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>16818</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>16818</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><para>That, on Tuesday, 28 October 2003:</para><para>(1)	The hours of meeting shall be 9.30 a.m. to 12.45 p.m., and 2 p.m. to adjournment.</para><para>(2)	The routine of business from 9.30 a.m. to 12.45 p.m. shall be government business only.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>16818</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the debate and commend the motion to the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>16818</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western AustraliaâManager of Government Business in the Senate) (7.31 p.m.)âI move: </para><motion><para>That the government business order of the day for 30 October 2003 relating to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 be called on immediately.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16819</page.no><id.no>R1840</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>16819</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 21 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Troeth</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>16819</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI might open my contribution to the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> by noting in passing that the opposition, as always, is a pinnacle of cooperation. We have given a significant number of extra hours to the government already, prior to the commencement of the debate on this most significant agency, so that the government can do its timetabling properly and there can be full discussion on this important matter. So I state the claim at the outset that the opposition, as always, is cooperating with the government.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> repeals the provisions of the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 that require the Commonwealth to retain 50.1 per cent of equity in Telstra, enabling Telstra to be fully privatised. Labor have always opposed the further sale of Telstra and we will maintain our rock solid opposition to its further sale in the Senate this week. The government is trying to steamroll this bill through the parliament. The ink has barely dried in the Senate report tabled less than an hour agoâin fact, the printers are still warmâand here we are debating this most critical issue. The government wants to sell Telstra as soon as possible to satisfy its ideological obsession with privatisation at all costs.</para><para>Labor oppose the sale of Telstra because we want Telstra, with majority government ownership, delivering decent telecommunication services to all Australians regardless of wherever they might live in this country. Ownership does matter in securing this outcome. Not only do we oppose the sale of Telstra; we also reject this bill in its entirety. This bill, which purports to future proof regional telecommunications services, does nothing of the sort. The inquiry into this bill discovered that the future-proofing arrangements in the bill are a sham. There is no future proofing at all. Former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Senator Alston has done a magnificent sales jobâindeed, a con jobâwith the Nationals on this bill. He did initially have some trouble getting this bill through the government's party rooms, but he really did manage to sell the Nationals a turkey this time.</para><para>The provision for an optional regional licence condition leaves the terms of such a condition entirely at the discretion of the minister. This provision cannot be described as future proofing as there is no guarantee of any particular level of regional services in the section. There is not even the mention of the word `adequate' or any other like words in the bill. In the words of one submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:</para><quote><para>The regional licence provisions in the Bill are so qualified as to be virtually meaningless.</para></quote><para>When the government's own department was asked by Senator Mackay whether Telstra could maintain one regional shop in Gundagai and one technician in Kalgoorlie and still comply with the terms of the bill, the answer was an embarrassed yes. This bill does not even guarantee Telstra's existing service levelsâservice levels which in some places might include no mobile phone coverage, excruciatingly slow dial-up Internet speeds and constant Internet line drop-out. Let us not forget that the department also admitted that the regional licence condition in this bill is optionalâit is not even mandatory. </para><para>The bill's other supposed future proofing mechanism is a review of regional communications every five years by a committee appointed solely by the minister. The minister will be able to appoint to this committee whomever he or she might want. This reminds us of the appointment of Nationals member Dick Estens to last year's sham regional telecommunications inquiry. After this inquiry, Mr Estens somehow managed to produce a report favourable towards Telstra's regional service levels. This was despite his inquiry receiving hundreds of submissions from ordinary regional Australians complaining about poor Telstra services in areas like mobile phone coverage, Internet speeds and Internet line drop-out.</para><para>Under this bill, once the regional telecommunications review is published there is no requirement for the minister to do anything with the review other than table it in parliament and respond to it, as the minister of the day, as might be seen fit. This provision, therefore, cannot be described as future proofing as, again, there is no guarantee whatsoever of the provision of decent regional telecommunication service levels.</para><para>The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 allows the timing of the sale to remain open. If the bill is passed, the coalition will be able to sell Telstra whenever it wants to, regardless of whether services are up to scratch. In fact, the Prime Minister has recently been saying that services are pretty much up to scratch, despite overwhelming and repeated evidence to the contrary. Evidence presented to the Senate inquiry into this bill and to the Senate's Australian telecommunications network inquiry confirms that services are below par in regional Australia. Even Mr Estens admitted as much when asked whether regional services were up to scratch during the Senate inquiry in Dubbo a few weeks ago. During the course of this inquiry, Australian Communications Authority figures that the government had been parading around as evidence of decent regional service levels were exposed as grossly misleading. The ACA has painted Telstra's network reliability figures in an overly favourable light. The CEPU submission to the inquiry into this bill outlined evidence of a dilapidated regional network suffering from years of underinvestment and staff cutbacks. Telstra has cut back staffing numbers by tens of thousands since the Howard government came to power. Capital expenditure, which peaked in 2000 at around $4 billion per annum, is now projected to fall below $3 billion. Just in last three weeks, the near collapse of sections of Telstra's BigPond email service has shown us what can happen when Telstra underinvests in its networks and staff. </para><para>The government's own mantra of not privatising Telstra before adequate regional telecommunications levels are in place has not been achieved. Even if this precondition is ever achieved, a privatised Telstra could never be regulated to deliver such services into the future. The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 removes the ministerial power of direction over Telstra once the government's share falls below 50 per cent. This removes an important reserve power for the government to ensure that Telstra acts in the national interest. Under the bill, Telstra would also cease to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act once the Commonwealth no longer has majority ownership of Telstra. Telstra will cease to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by way of Senate estimates and other such measures. Similarly, Telstra will no longer be required to provide their employees with legislated Commonwealth employee standards for long service leave, maternity leave and occupational health and safety once Telstra is sold. </para><para>The bill includes a provision empowering the government to create and sell sales-scheme hybrid securities in the Telstra sale process. These are sometimes complex financial instruments, with a mixture of debt and equity characteristics likely to appeal to institutional investors. There is no restriction in the legislation as to the amount of equity that may be sold by way of hybrid securities. Department of Finance and Administration officials have confirmed that issuing hybrids may have the effect of increasing the government's net debt position. This contradicts the government's position that it is selling Telstra to reduce government debt. </para><para>The bill's explanatory memorandum assumes a sale cost of between 1.1 per cent and two per cent. Assuming the remaining Commonwealth share in Telstra is worth $A30 billion, this would mean between $330 million and $600 million would be handed to investment bankers and corporate lawyers in any further sale of Telstra. It is ironic that the suits and the big investment banks and law firms in Sydney and Melbourne will be rolling in money from the Telstra sale but, under the terms of this bill, The Nationals and country Australians get nothing. We know The Nationals have secured nothing for regional Australia under this bill because the finance department stated that it is government policy to spend any Telstra sale proceeds on reducing government debt or funding Commonwealth liabilities. The finance department further confirmed that spending the Telstra sale proceeds on infrastructure would worsen the budget balance. Yet, despite this, The Nationals debated how they would spend the Telstra sale proceeds at their recent national conference. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, allowed this debate to occur, even though it is government policy to spend any Telstra sale proceeds on debt reduction. The Nationals appear to be oblivious to the fact that spending the Telstra sale proceeds on regional infrastructure would worsen the budget balanceâmost likely put the budget into deficitâand be in defiance of its own government's policy. National senators are voting this week for a bill that gives regional Australians nothingâno decent regional service levels and no Telstra sale proceeds. This bill will allow a fully privatised Telstra to leave town faster than the banks. Yet again, The Nationals have sold out on regional Australia.</para><para>No cogent arguments have been put forward supporting the privatisation of Telstra during the course of the Senate inquiry into this bill. Only six of the 160 submissions to the Senate inquiry supported the bill: two were from investment banks that stand to gain hundreds of millions of dollars in fees from any sale of Telstra, and one was from Telstra, whose executives stand to gain millions in extra remuneration if Telstra is privatised.</para><para>Telstra's submission to the Senate inquiry gave us some idea of what we could expect from a privately owned Telstra. Telstra's submitted that it should not be subject to Telstra-specific regulations and that these regulations were discriminatory. Current Telstra-specific regulations include price controls, untimed local calls, the universal service obligation and free directory assistance. By suggesting that these regulations are discriminatory, Telstra is foreshadowing the possibility that it will use whatever means it has at its disposal to remove these regulations once privatised. Timed local calls, price controls and directory assistance will all be under threat. Price controls on our airports were abandoned following their privatisation in 2002, and there can be no doubt that a fully privatised Telstra will seek the removal of Telstra's price controls. Telstra also stated in its submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill that any optional regional licence conditions imposed on them `should not be unduly prescriptive or burdensome and should be broadly compatible with Telstra's commercial interests', as stated in recommendation 8.1 of the regional telecommunications inquiry. This statement demonstrates that a fully privatised Telstra would only seek to service regional Australia when and where it was profitable to do so. </para><para>Labor believes that Telstra should remain a majority publicly owned company delivering high-quality telecommunications services to all Australians. Majority public ownership of Telstra ensures Telstra acts in the public interest, while also providing value to its two million shareholders. A fully privatised Telstra would be a huge private monopoly that would be too powerful for any government to effectively regulate. A fully privatised Telstra would prioritise shareholder value and profitability above all else. It will leave town faster than the banks. Under this bill, Telstra's regional service levels would be entirely at the discretion at the minister and the government of the day. There are no guarantees whatsoever for future regional service levels in this bill.</para><para>Selling Telstra will not benefit the Commonwealth financially. Once Telstra is sold, the public dividend, around $1.7 billion in 2002-03, is lost forever. Telstra is critical to our nation's future. It is a key national asset. A privately owned Telstra would neglect its social responsibilities to the detriment of all Australians, especially those in regional Australia. Keeping Telstra in majority public ownership will ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they live, will receive decent, adequate and equitable telecommunications services into the future. Labor believes Telstra should not be privatised. Labor opposes the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003. We call on the crossbenches to back our stand and vote against this bill so that we can keep Telstra public for all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>16822</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian Democrats will be voting against the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> because the government has failed to make out a case that this bill is in the public interest. Evidence to the Senate committee revealed lack of competition, continued dissatisfaction with services, high telecommunications prices, gaps in services between city and country Australia and a reduction in infrastructure investment. This is all contrary to the 1996 coalition policy on privatisation, which said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>The Liberal and National Parties believe privatisation should only occur where it is demonstrably in the public interest.</para></quote><para>Under its Charter for the National Interest, the coalition argued that privatisation should require evidence of a clear public benefit to be derived from the privatisation of a particular sector; a focus on benefits to consumers, including protection of consumer interests; and a commitment to maintain community service obligations, recognising the special needs of rural and regional Australians. Yet the Senate inquiry into this billâand I attended every hearingâshowed that, on all key criteria, the government has failed to make out a case that the sale is justified and in the public interest.</para><para>In addition to the Senate inquiry, Senator Bartlett and I undertook a survey of people from regional and rural Queensland, asking how they felt about the government's agenda, supported by The Nationals, to sell off the rest of Telstra. This activity was inspired by comments made by the Leader of The Nationals, John Anderson, when he said that Telstra's services were up to scratch and The Nationals were prepared to sell it on that basis. We surveyed residents in four Nationals electorates and in three Liberal electorates covering Bundaberg, Coolum Beach, Dalby, Gladstone, Hervey Bay, Mackay, Maryborough, Nambour, Warwick and Thuringowa. The response was huge, with 13,000 responses. The results showed an overwhelming opposition around regional Queensland, with 80 per cent opposed to the further sale of Telstra. </para><para>The Nationals member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott, voted to sell Telstra. In his speech to parliament on the further sale of Telstra, he said:</para><quote><para>I have always said that I would only support the full sale of Telstra once services in the bush were up to scratch.</para></quote><para>Yet our survey of the people in his electorate of Maranoa found that 80 per cent disagreed with his view that the government had improved the level of telecommunication services to such a degree that the sale should proceed. More than 78 per cent believed the standard of services provided by Telstra would decline if it were fully privatised. More than 83 per cent believed the further sale of Telstra would not benefit them. The Liberal member for the electorate of Herbert, Peter Lindsay, also voted to sell Telstra. In his speech to parliament on the further sale of Telstra, he said:</para><quote><para>The electorate wants to see the full privatisation of Telstra.</para></quote><para>Yet the survey of his electorate of Herbert showed that 85 per cent of Townsville respondents did not support the further sale of Telstra. More than 80 per cent believed the standard of services provided by Telstra would decline if it were fully privatised. More than 80 per cent disagreed with the government that telecommunications services had improved to a level that should allow the further sale of Telstra. These results were reflected in the seats of Fairfax, Fisher, Longman and DawsonâDawson, very interestingly, is De-Anne Kelly's seat and, again, over 80 per cent were opposed to the sale of Telstra. Yet all of these sitting members supported the sale of Telstra. Importantly, the survey also asked people whether they thought the Senate was doing the right thing in preventing Telstra from being sold off, and 80 per cent believed the Senate was in fact doing the right thing. So that is the view of the people of Queensland.</para><para>The government's view is that privatisation will increase competition in the domestic markets. Despite partial privatisation of Telstra in 1997 and 1999, the ACCC's view is that:</para><quote><para>Competition has not developed as extensively as generally expected after full competition was introduced in 1997 and that various telecommunications markets are not yet effectively competitive.</para></quote><para>In fact, during 2001-02 the ACCC reported that progress towards achieving competitive telecommunications markets slowed. The ACCC gave evidence that there were some existing and potential emerging structural impediments to the development of effective competition in potentially contestable markets and that one of the key factors was that Telstra dominates the market in all major telecommunications services. In addition, Telstra remains in almost total control of the customer access network, and it is the only supplier of territorial fibre infrastructure into many regional areas. In relation to the Internet, Telstra not only provides the connection service for the vast majority of subscribers but is also the biggest single ISP. Through Foxtel, Telstra dominates content and distribution of pay TV services. Australia is the only developed country where the incumbent telco is also allowed to operate the cable TV network.</para><para>In their report on emerging market structures, the ACCC identified that, without competition between telecommunications infrastructure providers, it was likely that networks would not be developed and used to their full potential. Not only does the bill reduce the ability to monitor and intervene in market power abuse; the ACCC gave evidence that no areas of the bill actually improved competition. Further, there is little evidence around the world that reducing public ownership improves customer outcomes, particularly in markets where the former government telco retains strong market dominance. </para><para>Comparing public ownership with the OECD's price for domestic phone charges comparator highlights this relationship. Three of the four countries with the cheapest phone prices have majority publicly owned telcos, while three of the four with the highest prices have private ownership rates of their telcos in excess of 90 per cent. The Democrats believe that the government have provided no evidence to support privatisation as a means of reversing the slowdown in competition and benefits to consumers, as observed by the ACCC. We would argue that further consideration needs to be given to the structural impediments and to further regulation before any further privatisation is even considered.</para><para>On the topic of structural separation, the committee in the course of its inquiry received considerable evidence on whether the telecommunications markets in Australia can ever be fully competitive if Telstra is not structurally separated. The OECD has recommended that structural separation should be considered as a means of promoting competition in utilities and as a preferred alternative to regulation. The National Competition Council in Australia adopts a similar view to the OECD which is reflected in the Competition Principles Agreement. Similarly, the ACCC, in its report to government in July on competition telecommunications, concluded that the structural power of Telstra precludes regulation being fully effective in ensuring fair competition and pricing.</para><para>Several models of structural separation could be considered. The OECD, the National Competition Council and the Competitive Carriers Coalition mostly focus on what is called vertical separationâseparating out the wholesale network from the retail service provision. It has been acknowledged by several commentators, however, that such an option carries with it high transitional costs. The ACCC and Professor John Quiggin have argued instead for horizontal separationâseparating out whole parts of Telstra's businesses with the potential to compete against the rest of the business. The ACCC has recommended to the government that the Foxtel HFC, or hybrid fibre cable, network be divested, which, it argues, could form a new competitor for Telstra.</para><para>For Australia to ensure that the opportunities for competitive outcomes are maximised, we need to ask fundamental questions about whether the current structure of the telecommunications market is optimal and whether the power of a vertically and horizontally integrated Telstra will kill off competition into the future. It is disappointing that, despite the recommendations of the NCC, the ACCC and the OECD, the government has not yet explored the competitive advantages, costs and benefits of the various structural separation alternatives. We certainly recommend that this needs to occur.</para><para>A further key argument raised for the sale of Telstra is that 49.9 per cent private ownership leaves the company half pregnantâalready required to act in the commercial interests of all shareholders, but restrained by public ownership from making full commercial decisions. However, Telstra in its evidence acknowledged that the government's 50.1 per cent ownership allows it to decide the composition of Telstra's board of directors. If a director fails to satisfy the government it could easily vote them off, which remains a powerful control mechanism for all majority shareholders. As Professor Bob Walker, a shareholder activist, told our committee: </para><quote><para>Majority shareholders have a controlling interest, and are capable of calling the shots on the financing and operating decisions of corporationsâregardless of the pious sentiments expressed in the Corporations Act.</para></quote><para>Professor Quiggin argued that Telstra's majority public ownership, in acting as a brake on offshore investment, probably saved the company and taxpayers a large amount of money, in that it was unable to participate in the dotcom bubble during the 1990s and that, as a percentage of GDP, Australia's losses were small compared with those of the US and elsewhere. Government officials acknowledged to the committee that majority ownership has resulted in a high level of reporting and interaction between the department of finance and Telstra management. Finance department officials said:</para><quote><para>The CAC act sets out quite an intense overlay of reporting to the government as the majority shareholder in terms of annual reporting et cetera that private sector companies do not have, and that generates interaction. There is a lot of interaction.</para></quote><para>Under the bill that is being considered, a range of public accountability measures, including the application of the Freedom of Information Act and the requirement for Telstra to appear before Senate estimates committees, will be removed. The minister's power to direct Telstra in the national interest will cease to apply when the Commonwealth's equity has fallen below 50 per cent, as will the application of FOI and the application of Commonwealth public sector employment and occupational health and safety laws. When the Commonwealth's equity falls below 15 per cent, the bill will repeal the power of the minister under the act to require Telstra to provide financial reports to the Commonwealth, the obligation of Telstra to notify the minister of significant events, the obligation to keep ministers informed of the operation of Telstra and its subsidiaries, the obligation to provide the minister with its corporate plan and the obligation to provide the Commonwealth with prior notice of any action which may dilute the Commonwealth's holding.</para><para>As can be seen, majority public ownership does have a significant impact on Telstra's ability to operate, notwithstanding the obligation on the board to maximise profits. This bill substantially reduces the requirements of Telstra to interact with the government and the parliament and thus properly fulfil its public interest obligations. It is clear that customer dissatisfaction with telecommunications is on the rise. An analysis of the results of consumer awareness and information needs surveys conducted by the Australian Communications Authority paints a worsening picture of consumer confusion and distrust in the telecommunications marketplace. As the Australian Consumer Association noted:</para><quote><para>... all comparable indicators show a decline in consumer regard for the market. There is an explicit and progressive deterioration in consumer confidence.</para></quote><para>Recent figures from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman show that complaints against Telstra rose by 2.9 per cent in the year to 30 June. The Australian Communications Authority has reported that customer satisfaction with telcos in Australia fell from 74 per cent to 60 per cent in 2002. The 2003 <inline font-style="italic">OECD Communications Outlook </inline>showed that Australians were paying more for their phones than most industrialised countriesâ44 per cent more than the British, 35 per cent more than Canadians and 11 per cent more than the Americans. The ACA's <inline font-style="italic">Telecom</inline><inline font-style="italic">munications Performance Monitoring Bulletin</inline> also showed a downward trend in all indicators of customer service guarantees in the most recent quarter. Indeed, there has been a marked change in performance, particularly in urban areas. For example, the percentage of faults cleared by Telstra within CSG time frames rose from eight per cent in June 2001 to 18 per cent in June 2003. Nationally, the percentage of faults repaired by Telstra within CSG time frames fell from 93 per cent in June 2001 to just 86 per cent in June 2003. </para><para>The ACA has indicated that it is concerned by Telstra's urban faults performance and has sought assurances from Telstra that they will take the necessary steps to raise the level of performance, but it remains to be seen how effective that will be. The Communications Workers Union has questioned the effectiveness of the benchmark of CSG faults, arguing that the emphasis on statistics has resulted in quick-fix temporary work being done to clear faults without dealing with underlying problems. Whilst the ACA acknowledges that this may be the cause of some of the recurring faults, it says that the new network reliability framework will allow the regulator to be able to work out where recurring faults were, what problems were being exhibited and do something about them. But the network reliability framework is still in its early stages. It could yet prove to be a powerful tool to require the upgrading of the network. For example, as a result of the Estens report the authority was required to prepare a report on improving the effectiveness of the network reliability framework. That report was handed to the minister on 30 September. The Democrats urge the government to respond to that report promptly and support further enhancement and enforcement of the network reliability framework.</para><para>The fundamental problem remains the regulatory environment in which the ACA operates. By legislation the ACA is obliged to be a `light' operator, relying heavily on self-regulatory industry codes. Certainly it raises questions about whether it can regulate a monopoly infrastructure provider, particularly through a future-proofing requirement. According to the evidence to the committee from Telstra, it will cost Telstra $5 billion to increase Internet speeds across Australia from the 19.2 kilobits per second mandated by the Estens report to the 56 kilobits per second standard that would bring urban and rural Australia to the same standard. In contrast, the government's response to the Estens report provides only $181 million in new funding, which falls well short of the amount required to deliver rural services. Even Dick Estens conceded to the committee that it will require progressively increasing levels of government regulation to push up rural standards. He said that 19.2 kilobits per second was a minimum baseline that will need to be lifted as time goes on.</para><para>The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts emphatically disagreed with this approach, arguing that it was not practicable to say there should be some kind of mandated service upgrade because services change so quickly. This is simply a cop-out. It is worth noting that between 1995 and 2000 Telstra's capital investment averaged between 22 and 27 per cent of its revenues. By 2003 it had slumped to just 15.5 per cent of revenue and it is projected to fall to less than 14 per cent this financial year. This compares with the OECD average of around 23 per cent of revenue. If Telstra were required to restore capital expenditure to 20 per cent of revenue, a level it held for all but the most recent years, it would increase capital spending by $1.35 billion a year, which would allow on Telstra's estimates a full overhaul of the network to a 56 kilobits per second standard in just four years. The Democrats believe that it would not be an unreasonable ask for the minister to use his powers under part 3 of the Telstra Corporation Act to direct Telstra, in the national interest, to upgrade its full network to that capacity. </para><para>In summary, the Democrats report recommends that the Telstra bill be rejected by the Senate. We do not believe that the government has made a case that there is a public benefit to be had from proceeding with this bill. In the meantime, we urge the government to ensure that the telecommunications market is substantially improved. We recommend that regulation to protect consumers, increase competition and improve network reliability be strengthened before any further privatisation is considered. We recommend that, in accordance with subclause 4(3) of the Competition Principles Agreement, an independent authoritative review be undertaken on structural separation, including consideration of the ACCC's report on emerging market structures in the communications sector, before any further consideration is given to the full privatisation of Telstra. We recommend that a comprehensive analysis of Telstra's investment in infrastructure be undertaken and that Telstra be directed to increase its investment in infrastructure to meet tougher performance standards.</para><para>If the government is interested in and serious about trying to turn around that 80 per cent opposition to the sale, it needs to acknowledge that the public is not convinced that the government has put up a case that this sale is in the public interest. If the government wants to convince that 80 per cent of people that this sale is a good idea, it needs to address the issue of infrastructure. It needs to address the issue of competition. It needs to address the issue of rising fault rates around Australia. It needs to address the issue of the gap between city and country services. It needs to address the concern about future-proofing of new services. It needs to address the huge gap between Telstra's current delivery of broadband Internet services and the public's expectation of what is reasonable. It needs to address the issues contained in this report and to convince the Australian people that this particular sale is appropriate.</para><para>The problem to date is that the government has not been prepared to do any of those things. We have a sale bill that will reduce the financial benefit to the public sector in Australia. It will increase rather than reduce the problems with competition policy and telecommunications in Australia, and it will do nothing to guarantee future-proofing of rural services or improvement in the declining fault clearance rate in urban services in Australia. From these points of view, the Democrats are adamant that this bill should not be supported by the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>16827</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is no doubt about two things in relation to the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. They are that the government has solidly canvassed the option of a full sale of Telstra over consecutive parliamentary terms and that the community opposition to such a sale, primarily in the rural and regional areas of Australia, is a potent political presence with which the government must deal. To that extent we agree with some of the contributions made by Senator Cherry and the Democrats, but that is the extent of our agreement in relation to that point, particularly consultation.</para></talk.start><para>I obviously support this bill as sound public policy. It amends the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to repeal the provisions of that act that require the Commonwealth to retain 50.1 per cent of its equity in Telstraâthat is, in the pejorative terms used by opponents to governments getting out of ownership, privatisation at its most basic. There is a viewâand, whatever else, we must recognise that it existsâthat is forcefully held by many people that governments should run public utilities. It is said by proponents of that policy that government ownership guarantees that services will be universally available. It does not, of course. Ultimately economics decides such questions. </para><para>The era of universal service by government utilities is gone. We have only to look at the railways to see the truth of that. Governments, in my view, are far better employed to ensure that the economy is responsive to and reflective of the real opportunities for economic advancement and social growth that exist for Australia as an integral and vital part of the global system. That is the basic proposition that this government advances: public utilities must have mandated obligations in Australia because of the nature of our dispersed population and the varied conditions in which people live. For example, we need to boost the inland. We need to ensure that Australians have the free choice to live, work and raise families where they wish. That must always be a fundamental element of a national policy. But these things, so far as they impose an additional cost on the public purse, are far better managed by defining a universal service obligation and paying a private entity to meet that obligation. Schedule 1 to the bill provides:</para><quote><para>... any licence condition made by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and Arts requiring Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural or remote parts of Australia may empower the Minister or the Australian Communications Authority to make decisions of an administrative character.</para></quote><para>That means imposing and paying for a universal service obligation. It is there in black and white. It states that the licence condition will provide a high degree of certainty and reassurance for regional, rural and remote communitiesâin other words, that an effective Telstra presence be maintained and that Telstra maintain the right to manage its regional operations autonomously and in its commercial interests.</para><para>This is an important point to understand. It is crucial to understanding the government's position. It is particularly important that Australians who live in regional, rural or remote areas appreciate what we are saying. I say that particularly as a senator for Queensland. My state has 3.7 million people and the highest proportion of Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas. It is our most decentralised state. It is a place that demonstrates daily and in a unique way within our Federation the absolute necessity for federal governments to continually monitor and consult with the parts of our country that lie outside the Canberra-Sydney-Melbourne triangle. This government does so, and it has been doing so particularly in relation to the bill that we are debating tonight. In my view it does it better than most of the governments that have held power since Federation. It certainly does it betterâmuch betterâthan its immediate predecessor.</para><para>At the same time we must recognise that, on the arguments that have thus far penetrated into public debateâfairly basic, black and white arguments, sometimes fuelled by the skewed perspective of, for example, those who take it upon themselves to subjectively poll public opinionâthere is a hefty level of public disbelief in the principle of selling the country's largest telecommunications corporation. Senator Cherry was recently on Brisbane radio talking about a survey the Australian Democrats had done in regional Queensland, which he said resulted in figures of between 77 and 80 per cent opposed to selling the rest of Telstra. We heard him again repeat those figures in his arguments this evening in this place. It was unashamedly a political exercise. </para><para>It was the sort of survey the Democrats and others like to dress up as serving the higher purpose of policy when in fact they are seeking a political answer and, as such, it is skewed to the outcome its originators wanted. It surveyed public opinion on the Sunshine Coast, in Townsville, and in the four federal seats that the National PartyâThe Nationals, as they now areâhold in Queensland. Let me say this: it is reasonable for people to be concerned that, if the rest of Telstra is sold and as the Democrats put it the government loses the ability to decide who is to be on the board of Telstra, the focus of the corporation will be towards dividends for its shareholders rather than on investment in improved service. That is a genuine concern. It is one that would be shared, I think, very broadly throughout the Australian community. That concern would, I believe, be very largely met if reviews by the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee into telecommunications in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia were conducted every three years. In particular, since the central problem would appear to be one of public perception, that concern would be met by measures to improve understanding of the current system of regulation of the telecommunications industry and the rights of consumers under this regulatory regime. </para><para>The Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee made extensive inquiries into the bill and its effects following on from the recommendation of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee that such an inquiry be conducted. It held seven hearings, two of them in regional centres, and heard from 41 groups of witnesses, including several private citizens. The bill we are debating does not sell Telstra today; it simply keeps the government's options open to maximise the return at the time of sale.</para><para>In relation to the alleged benefits of continued government control of Telstra, so far as these extend to commitments to maintain and improve services to regional Australia it needs to be noted that the high hopes some people profess on that front are not shared by those directly involved in the industry either as direct participants or as regulators. These are people who are talking about actuality at the coalface. They are not quoting from some Fabian primer or from a fundamental misconception of what a government can actually do in terms of repairing your phone or connecting it or upgrading the service. They should be listened to, especially by those opposite.</para><para>The fact is that any uneconomic service that Australians need because of remoteness or size of market needs to be supported by public money. That is the service obligation issue. It is in a very real sense a separate issue from that of whether or not to sell the rest of Telstra. The best way to improve the level of customer satisfaction with service, particularly perhaps with repair services, is to provide competition. The free market is a great driver of competition. In the cities and in the closely settled areas commercial competition is a huge plus for customers.</para><para>We do need to recognise that where remoteness is a factor, where the overall size of the market is a factor in the sense of its being small and therefore not profitable or a market with growth potential, we need to construct a model for service that will not disadvantage people who live outside a metropolitan area or outside a large regional centre. I believe the government has done this with this bill among other elements of the long debate we have had about the future of the telecommunications industry in this country. The Labor Party of course does notâor says it does not. </para><para>It is always difficult to establish precisely what it is that the Labor Party stands for today. From many perspectives, and telecommunications is one, it often looks as if it stands for a retreat to the 1950s or even earlier. This is in stark contrast to the early Hawke Labor government, the one that deregulated the financial markets and floated the dollar. That was good policy and deserves to be credited as such, and we have done so. But as we all know, it then wandered off and began to commune with the fairies at the bottom of the garden. It still has to come to its senses. It still has to realise that we are now in the 21st century. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name></talker><para>âIf you ask about the Democrats then I suppose they could be described in relation to this issue as the fairies that you are communing with. Australia is no longer an isolated and protected place. It is not some sort of independent biosphere. It is not a social laboratory for the self-professed mind readers among us to experiment in. That we now exist in a society that is a fully integrated part of the global economy is unquestionably to our advantage. And it is unquestionably to the advantage of future generations of Australians that this is so. The Labor Party would do everyone a favour if it woke up and argued a case for the future rather than one for the past. The past is a foreign country and the future is our frontier. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The transitional provisions in this bill are far reaching in their effect on how Telstra will eventually move into full private ownership. The bill includes amendments that preserve the rights of Telstra employees with long service leave and maternity leave entitlements or certain retirement benefits under Commonwealth legislation while they remain Telstra employees. That is fair; that is `fair dinkum', to use a term given new currency by an honoured guest of our country who spoke in the other chamber last week at our invitation and to whom Senator Brown and Senator Nettle, to their indelible shame, were unconscionably rude in so infantile a way.</para><para>The transitional provisions require Telstra to continue to deal with any requests made under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 for access to a document in Telstra's possession not finally disposed of when Telstra ceases to be Commonwealth controlled. They also require Telstra to preserve the rights of persons making such requests under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. They will enable the Commonwealth Ombudsman to continue to investigate any complaints in relation to action taken by Telstra that have not been finally disposed of when Telstra ceases to be Commonwealth controlled. The provisions preserve the operation, in respect of events occurring prior to Telstra ceasing to be Commonwealth controlled, of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 and the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. They will also ensure that, from the cessation of Commonwealth control, Telstra's liability in respect of injuries suffered by employees prior to 1 July 1999 continues under section 128A of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. They will remove Telstra from the operation of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 from the time of cessation of Commonwealth control. These provisions are reasonable, sensible and indeed what you would expect to see in a bill of the sort we are debating tonight. There are many other provisions in the clauses but there is nothing that I would characterise as extraordinary.</para><para>In terms of the financial impact of the bill, once in effect, it is true to say that the full financial costs and benefits from a future sale or sales of the Commonwealth's remaining shareholding in Telstra are difficult to quantify at this stage. That is, after all, the nature of a commercial deal with the private market. But, as the explanatory notes make clear, the total market value of the Commonwealth's remaining shares in Telstra, based on the share price on 16 June 2003, is about $29 billion. The amount that would be raised from a future sale or sales would of course be dependent on the sale processes, the structure of the offer and market circumstances at the time. </para><para>The 2003-04 budget papers indicated that the forward estimates included the effect of the sale of the Commonwealth's shareholding in Telstra. They noted that the level of proceeds would depend, among other things, on the prevailing levels of world equity markets at the time of the sale. The government proposes to use the proceeds of the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining shareholding in Telstra to reduce net debt, and it may also be allocated to fund other Commonwealth liabilities. Reducing net debt is sound fiscal policy. We on this side of the chamber certainly understand that. If your debt is low, your benefits rise as a consequence in terms of the true value of Australia to the world. Low debt means good credit ratings. Low debt removes us still further from the dark days of the Keating Treasury when the banana republic appeared to be becoming a self-fulfilling prophesy. Low debt means that we do not have to keep paying extraordinarily large sums of money to service debt.</para><para>I am sure that the Labor Party opposite understand this, or at least that the rational parts of the Labor Party do. I am also sure the Australian Democrats understand this essential fact of life. We do not really know what the Greens might think about it, but that does not really matter; we know they oppose a saleâbut then so do the Labor Party. The Greens oppose it presumably for ideological reasonsâthey do so like to demonstrate. The Labor Party oppose it for political reasons, unless they really have all trotted off to la-la land. Some evidence that this unfortunately might have occurred is to be found in the speech the Leader of the Opposition delivered on this bill in the House of Representatives on 14 August. He said of the debate:</para><quote><para>It is not just a debate about whether to sell a national icon ...</para></quote><para>Telstra is many things, among them a first-class telecommunications company, but I seriously doubt that it qualifies as an icon. I think what the Leader of the Opposition meant was that it was a debate about whether or not to sell the public stake in this country's largest telecommunications company. This is an era in which the value of language is being continually debased by the application of superlatives to the not very extraordinary at all.</para><para>These days we have starsâor so we are continually toldâwhere most people on any objective analysis would only identify the glow of a 60-watt globe. We apparently have icons everywhere we turnâtoday some of them are people. Presumably these are people who like the thought of being a small, primitively executed painting, or at least do not object to the concept. I do not think that the corporate entity that is Telstra would be a feasible devotional object to place on a wall. Nor do I think that the case for not selling Telstraâand there are of course always two sides to any argumentâwill be advanced by declaring it to be a national icon or even a living treasure.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, it is certainly true that at face value it would appear that a very large number of Australians oppose selling the rest of Telstra. Those of us in favour of a sale must recognise this and argue the case for the sale even more strongly and cogently. I believe a much more reasonable and reasoned argument on Telstra was presented by my friend the member for Moncrieff, also on 14 August. He was commenting on the numerous examples cited by the independent member for Calare as reasons not to sell and said: </para><quote><para>I was intrigued because the member made no mention of the fact that these same problems also existed when Telstra was 100 per cent publicly owned.</para></quote><para>I should add that it was 100 per cent publicly owned during the very long time of Labor rule. The member for Moncrieff went on to say:</para><quote><para>The fact is that there will always be examples of how people are adversely affected by poorly performing telecommunications equipment.</para></quote><para>That is a fact. Keeping a 51 per cent government equity in Telstra will not make it possible to eradicate complaints about services, nor will it eliminate reasons to complain. The member for Moncrieff went on to say thisâand I commend his words to those opposite who apparently still believe in the tooth fairy:</para><quote><para>... a privatised Telstra will not have an impact on service delivery.</para></quote><para>I believe that market forces are a far better regulator of service delivery than governments can ever be. There is nothing like the whiff of competition to put some extra zip into performance. It is true that there are some parts of Australia where the full beneficial effect of corporate competition will never be felt. That is why our federal system of government works so well. That is why we are continually hearing from members in the other place and senators in this chamber about the problems that a centralised government would rarely hear.</para><para>Telstra has grasped the reality of today's marketplace for telecommunications. The product it provides is world class. That does not mean it could not be better. Of course it could be better, and Telstra would be the first to say so. One way to be better is to be free of government control. The obligation to provide acceptable levels of service in non-economic markets is an issue for government, not for private enterprise. The Australian public accepts the need to support the living standards of Australians who live in places where some services might be absent, but there is really no argument for the case that government ownership guarantees servicesâfar less that these should automatically and at whatever cost match in every respect those that are available in places where there is the population to support them.</para><para>It is a fact that a half sold Telstra is a dysfunctional creature. It is, in the picturesque words of another era, neither fish nor fowl. But those who argue that a privatised Telstra cannot be compelled within the law to perform certain tasksâand that is the nub of the political argument that is advanced from the other side of this chamberâare talking nonsense and they know it. The Trade Practices Act stands in the way of a monopoly situation developingâanother answer to another furphy that those opposite like to advance as a sensible argument.</para><para>Misuse of market power is a constant element in any economy and regulators must step in to end that misuse. But there is plenty of competition in the Australian telecommunications industry and no reason to suppose that privatising the bit of it that is not already wholly a private enterprise will do anything other than further free Telstra to compete. People who now complain about Telstra service standardsâthe 45 per cent cited by Senator Cherry in his radio interview in Brisbane on 21 October and todayâshould think about where they would be under an organisation that was wholly government owned and operated. The history of the 20th century is littered with examples of government monopolies that looked great on paperâiconic, if you likeâbut which did not perform. We do not want to go back there. Australians do not want to go back there. </para><para>Australians demand choice. This government is about providing choice. We know it is anathema to the Labor Party. That is what the present divide in Australian politics is all about. We provide choice. We provide options. They provide a one-size-fits-all approachâtake it or leave it: options that are nothing of the sort. Competitive conditions and commercial decisions are the best way for both shareholders and customers to benefit. We know that. We have implemented that process right across the economy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>16833</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> but, before I get to the substance of my speech, it is appropriate that I address some of Senator Santoro's points.

I am not sure. Senator Santoro also talked about the fact that he is arguing the case for the future and we are arguing the case for the past. The reality is that telecommunications is about the future. The issue of telecommunications infrastructure cannot be disassociated from the future. The government talks about the issue of future proofing. The future is an unknown country; we do not know what is coming up in the future. How on earth can you future proof for something that you do not know about? There is a great quote from Bill Scales, which I do not have here but I am happy to use at some other time. Basically, he said you cannot future proof because you do not know what the future is going to be. What we are doing is keeping 51 per cent of Telstra as custodians for the Australian people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Santoro also said that this is about reducing debt. That is not what The Nationals are sayingâI think they are called The Nationals now or is it the National Party or the National Country Party? I think it is The Nationals and that is not what they are saying. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, is actually saying that he will be pushing within the party room to allocate millions and millions or billions of dollars for an infrastructure fund. When it was put to him by, I presume, Mr Costello, and perhaps Senator Minchin, that this would put the budget into deficit, a spokesperson from his office said, `C'est la vie', or not quite those words but said, `That is the way it is. We will determine how it is spent and we will determine what the proceeds are used for.' It is interesting that, on the one hand, you have the Liberal Party saying, `This is all about debt reduction.' On the other hand, you have the National Partyâwho we have not heard from yetâwho are still having the big brawl internally with the Treasurer as to where the proceeds will in fact go. The Nationals are right to have that brawl because they know what the feeling is in regional Australia with respect to that. </para><para>Senator Santoro also talked about market forces. I say to Senator Santoro: go out into regional Australia and tell them about market forces; go out into regional Australia and tell them about what has happened with the banks; go out into regional Australia and tell them about how much better off they are as a result of market forces and you will get hounded out of whatever country town you happen to be in. We are saying that market forces and a fully privatised Telstra will mean fewer services for regional Australia and they know it. They are not stupid. They do not buy the government's line with respect to this. They know that a fully privatised Telstra will spend money where there is money to be made. They will go where the profits are to be made. And let us be blunt: in many areas of regional Australia there is not a profit or a quid to be made. That is the reality.</para><para>Having dispensed with some of the fairly specious arguments of Senator Santoro, I will return to what I would like to say as deputy chair of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. We will not support this bill. We have always been opposed to the full privatisation of Telstra, and we will remain so. We said when the first tranche of Telstra was sold that this was a bad idea, and the government said, `Look, it's okay. You can be fish and fowl.' The government said this. I have a quote from Peter Costello sitting in my office saying that a partially privatised Telstra can work. I have got quotes from Senator Minchin sitting in my office in which he said that this is a good thing, that you can have a partially privatised Telstra. And now we have the governmentâ`truth overboard'âsaying you cannot do that now, that you can be neither fish nor fowl. Get your rhetoric right.</para><para>Nothing I read or heard with regard to the inquiry suggested anything other than opposing the bill as the only reasonable position to hold. The government set up a quick and dirty inquiry, having been forced to do so by the non-government parties. They rushed through the inquiry, they rushed through the hearings, they rushed through the reporting and now they want to rush through the debateâand I would take people to the comments I made prior to dinner. Labor senators were concerned from the very start about the exceedingly tight time frame for this inquiry. This is a critical piece of legislation which has the potential to touch the lives of every Australian. It has particular relevance to the lives of those living in rural and regional Australia. One would therefore expect that those who would be most affected would be consulted on their views as to the legislation. Did we go to Western Australia? No, we did not.</para><para>The time frame for the report meant that there was very little timeâand seemingly no plan on the part of the governmentâto visit virtually any part of rural and regional Australia. The initial plan for the hearings was to take evidence in Sydney, Canberra, Dubboâand there was a bit of a tick for thatâand either Brisbane or Melbourne. There was no plan to visit Senator Lightfoot's home state of Western Australiaâyou did not hear anything from him. There was no plan to visit South Australia, no plan to visit the Northern Territoryâand I am sure my colleague Senator Crossin would have been most welcoming of the committee thereâno plan to visit any regional areas in Victoria or Queensland and certainly no plan to visit my home state and Senator Sherry's home state of Tasmania. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âOutrageous!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âIt is outrageous, Senator Sherry.

If I were a Tasmanian wishing to put in a submission opposing the full sale of Telstra, I certainly would not be sending it to Senator Barnett. In fact I have serious concerns about the propriety of this offer. The correct process, of course, of putting submissions to a Senate inquiry is for the submission to be sent to the committee secretariat, not some senator's office. I may take further advice and report back to the Senate on this.</para><para>I notice that currentlyâwith due deference to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watsonâthere is not one Tasmanian Liberal senator on the speakers list for this bill. Senator Barnett and his ilk are happy to take people's submissions. I do not know what they do with them. Hopefully they are read and hopefully they are passed on to the secretariat. I might make inquiries with respect to that. Neither he, nor any other Liberal senator from Tasmania, can be bothered turning up here and putting the views of the constituents in the submissions that he and other Liberal senators received. What on earth is that about? This is a critical issue for my home state of Tasmania and about which Tasmanians have a very strong view. They do not want to sell the remainder of Telstra because they know what will happen. After the deal that was done last time with Senator Harradine, within six months the government had ratted on that deal. If I had time I would go through in very explicit detail how the government did rat on the deal with Senator Harradine. I do not think that Senator Harradine has forgotten that in a hurry.</para><para>We were not happy that the people of Kalgoorlie, in Senator Lightfoot's home stateâwho have significant telecommunication problems and no mobile coverage on any of the highways out of townâdid not get a chance to speak to the inquiry. We were not happy that we did not get to Katherine so we could hear about the problems with Internet connections, which were brought to our attention by Senator Crossin, or about how the staff at the local health centre in Port Keats find it very difficult to access vital health information as a result of the Internet and intranet problems, or about how prisoners are held much longer than should be necessary because the Port Keats police station has to wait up to two hours for a bail application to come through. We were not happy that the people of Gippsland were denied the opportunity to voice their concerns about mobile coverage or Internet speed. We were not happy that Tasmaniansâwho experience major mobile phone coverage problems within half an hour's drive of the capital of Tasmania, Hobart, and who have recently discovered that their fixed line network is rotting in the ground, wrapped up with tape and plastic bagsâdid not get the opportunity to raise their concerns either. </para><para>All we got, after much pressure from Labor and Democrats senators on the committee, was an agreement that we could visit Nambour in Queensland. Our visit there showed how sensitive the government is with respect to gagging people in the regions. There is no way the government would have been able to continue with its plan to sell off its remaining share in Telstra if we had gone out to regional Australiaâit would not have been able to sustain the argument. In Nambour, in Senator Santoro's home state, we heard from a number of people, all of whom had terrible stories to tell, about being regularly without phones because of stormsânot an uncommon occurrence in Queenslandâabout being denied a phone by Telstra because it was too hard to get a phone there or too expensive, and about the cost to business and human relationships of being without reliable telecommunications services.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator Brandis</name></talker><para>âHas that got something to do with whether or not the government owns half of it, Senator Mackay?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âSenator Brandis, I would invite you to read the evidence.

I will tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we impose on Telstra price controls, untimed local calls, the universal service obligation and the free directory assistance. Are they the sorts of regulations that Telstra wants to be free of? I think they are. They said in their evidence that they would seek to be free of as many regulatory measures as they possibly could. That is what will happen with a privatised Telstra. Get rid of these regulations and how much will it cost to make a phone call in regional Australia then? How much will it cost to have the phone put on if you live out in the regions? We do not need to worry about that because according to the government the market will regulate it and competition will save the day. What competition?</para></talk.start></continue><para>What will be left is a huge private monopoly that will be hell bent on returning profits to shareholders. That is fair enough. Nobody is complaining about that. That is what big businesses do. So what? But we are not here to assist Telstra give money to its shareholders. We are here to assist the people of Australia and to ensure that they have a good telecommunications service and one that will actually go with us into the future and one that we can be proud of. Added to that, we have the risk that rural and regional Australia will be forever the poor cousins of metropolitan Australia when it comes to Internet access and speed, and it is, I reiterate, impossible to see how National Party senators or any senator representing regional Australiaâand I specifically include the non-speaking Tasmanian Liberal senators oppositeâcan possibly support this bill.</para><para>We have a guarantee from the Prime Minister that Telstra will not be sold until services in rural and regional Australia are `up to scratch'. I do not want to stand in this chamber for a minute and suggest that the Prime Minister would not be true to his word on that. I am sure that the never ever GST and the children who did not get thrown overboard were a mere aberration in his otherwise complete reliability on matters of truthfulness! However, I am not sure that everyone feels the same way as I do. For the purposes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, I am being facetious. In fact, most of those who gave evidence at the inquiry seem to think that not yet `up to scratch' was somewhat an understatement. It is actually inequitable access to telecommunications infrastructure and services around and across Australia. Getting services up to scratch implies a bit of buff and polish, a bit of new paint and we will be right. What is actually needed is a massive capital expenditure and a massive employment of field technicians together with a watertight regulatory environment to ensure that Telstra cannot renege on its obligations to regional Australia. The only way that that can be guaranteed is to keep the 51 per cent that is left in government hands, in the hands of the Australian people who own it.</para><para>What does the bill contain? Does the bill contain those sorts of guarantees? No, it does not. There are no caveats in the bill relating to service standards being acceptable before a sale can go ahead. There is nothing to suggest that Internet services will be incorporated into the universal service obligation. There is nothing. There is no future proofing. The minister of the day has complete discretion as to what an acceptable regional presence would be. No benchmarks, targets or standards in relation to this have been set. It is totally at the minister's direction. The advisory group that the government talk about is simply thatâit is advisory; it is not binding on the minister. All the minister has to do is table a statement in parliament saying why he or she disagrees with the advisory committee. Even had such standards been set, it would be hard to know how Telstra's performance would be tested or measured against them. We were shocked to hear of the evidence from the Australian Communications Authority, which Senator Bishop referred to: if you cannot trust the independent regulator, who can you trust? They themselves said that they felt their methodology may have been somewhat flawed and they undertook to fix that. </para><para>We are being asked here to support a bill that delivers nothing to the people of rural and regional Australia. In fact, I think things will be worse under a fully privatised Telstra and the bill makes no guarantees that they will not be worse. The Labor Party will be opposing this bill yet again and will be opposing the third tranche. The Nationals may be prepared to sell out rural and regional Australia but Labor will not. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>16839</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak briefly on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. I will speak not so much about the detail of the bill but on a very important issue that is associated with it: the bill goes to a very basic but very essential service. It is a service that is not a luxury; it is a service that is essential in the communication era that we exist in. I think that was touched on in the contribution by my colleague on the other side Senator Santoro, when he referred to a fully integrated global economy. I think that he is quite right. We are in a world that is totally expansive, where one must be a player no matter where one is. If one accepts that telecommunications is at the very heart of being a player in that fully integrated global economy then one must have real fears about the full privatisation of Telstra because the services are currently not up to scratchâas has been outlined in the evidence adduced by my colleagues and can be seen in their minority report. Whilst the government might claim otherwise it seems to be very much open to conjecture that the services provided by Telstra are up to scratch. Certainly in the rural and regional areas in a state such as Queensland, which is an expansive state, the services do not meet those that would be required to enable the people there to participate in a fully integrated global economy. That is the reality of life.</para></talk.start><para>If this bill takes Telstra to be a fully privately owned company then there certainly will be no guarantee that services will be available for those people as the communications field develops rapidly into the future. I think all of us around here would concede that even in the last 10 years the communications field has expanded into enormous new areas. I can recall when the first mobile phones arrivedâthey were chunky, big and cumbersomeâand today we have almost micro mobile phones available for use by almost everyone except those in rural and regional areas in Australia, where many of Telstra's services do not adequately reach. In my contention we are dealing with a very fundamental, basic service that will affect a lot of peopleâtheir future, their ability to operate in society and their ability to participate in society. Their capacity will be wrecked socially, educationally and from a business point of view if there is not a proper telecommunication system out there to enable them to participate in society.</para><para>One must have the latest communications systems availableâand I am not just speaking about telephone communications, because there are many systems of communications coming out which are not directly linked to telephones, such as SMS. Five years ago, who would have thought that a person such as I would have even contemplated what an SMS message was? Yet today SMS has become a vital part of communication in our society, particularly amongst younger peopleâas I have found out from my children who communicate regularly with me by SMS. I cannot say it is reciprocated as much as I would like. But that still does not mean that technology is not there, is not useful and should not be made available to people such as me. Ignorance or lack of skill alone should not mean that the technology should not be made available. </para><para>The important thing in society is that what is done is done for the common good. That must be elevated in this debate about the full sale of Telstra. If the sale is to be done then it must be done for the common good, and if it is not being done for the common good then the sale should not proceed. Obviously the government have come to the conclusion that the sale will be for the common good. From the evidence that I have adduced it is obvious that it will not be for the common good. As has already been mentioned here today, the sale will undoubtedly benefit those people who live in peak areas. It will benefit people in the Sydney-Melbourne-Canberra triangle and major centres such as those around the south-east corner of Queensland, where there is almost wall-to-wall housing now. It will benefit people in places such as Perth, maybe Adelaide, parts of Tasmania and the ACT. The sale must benefit all the community. If it is not going to benefit all of the community and if people in rural and regional areas are going to be denied access to the telco providerâand they should have been provided access through the likes of the majority publicly owned telco, Telstraâthen one would think that those people will be cheated indeed if the company is sold into full privatisation.</para><para>As I have said, the sale of the remaining part of Telstra will in my view fail the common good test. Clearly, any sale will remove the government's capacity as the majority shareholder to act in the national interest and for the common good of all Australians. To me, the national interest and the common good of all Australians is very important indeed. It is particularly so when we have people living remotely and in regional areas where the reach of new telecommunications is going to be so important, so essential to their ability to actively participate in our modern society and, as Senator Santoro described it, in a `fully integrated global economy'. They should not be penalised because of their remoteness. They should not be penalised because the overall size of the market in the region in which they live does not warrant special attention by the provider of telecommunications services in this country. In my submission, people in rural and regional Queensland have every right to fear, even dread, the capacity and willingness of a fully privatised Telstra to deliver services to them.</para><para>The government's assurances about universal service obligations, which were mentioned by Senator Brandis by way of interjection on Senator Mackay, really count for naught now that the first and second tranches of the Telstra sale have taken place. There has been a lot of consternation, not so much in the major centres but in the rural and regional areas, about what Telstra is doing to assist those areas in keeping up with the advancements that are being made in the telco area. The telecommunications area is expanding at an exponential rate in terms of products and services, and people in those areas fear that the government has let them down through the sale of the first two tranches of Telstra. The minority report of the Labor senators on the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee makes special reference to the issue of the universal service obligation. In paragraph 2.32 on page 50 it says: </para><quote><para>The Department also stated that it was not the Government's intention to bring Internet services under the umbrella of the Universal Service Obligation. The Universal Service Obligation ensures that standard telephone and payphone services are reasonably accessible to all Australians on an equitable basis regardless of where they live. If Telstra was fully privatised and had no obligation to provide Internet services reasonably and equitably to regional Australians we can safely assume that regional Australians would be paying more for Internet services and receiving an inferior service, as is often the case now. Once again the Government has shown no desire to âfuture-proofâ the new frontier in telecommunications servicesâthe Internetâand is pushing ahead with the sale of Telstra regardless.</para></quote><para>That comment by my colleagues in the minority report is terribly valid. I have three young children who have a love of, and access to, computers and the Internet which on many occasions assists them with their studies. If they did not have that access or it was limited in some way, they would be at a severe disadvantage indeed in pursuing the studies they do.</para><para>The need for a universal service obligation is fundamental to ensuring that everyone has reasonable and fair access to services to enable them to participate in this society at no disadvantage or at minimal disadvantage to others in the community. It already stands out that people in rural and regional areasâparticularly in places as diverse as Queensland, where there is a scattered and sparse rural and regional populationâare already disadvantaged. With the full privatisation of Telstra there would be no guarantee whatsoever of services to these people.</para><para>Whilst some assurances which the government gives from time to time might have a comforting resonance to those who are converted to the sale of Telstra, the reality is that no guarantee can be absolute and no government, regardless of what legislation it might put in place, can guarantee what a privately owned company could, would or should do now or in the future. That was brought out in the comments made by Senator Mackay. There is no guarantee that with the full sale of Telstra the privately owned company will be anything other than focused on profits. As Senator Mackay said, that is quite reasonable. No-one is arguing against companies making profits. But if those profits are made at the expense of the common good of the people in the community, one argues that they are not made in a proper and decent way.</para><para>Even without ever having studied Economics 101 at some prized university, one can work out that the major centres are always going to provide the basis for the continuing profitability of any company such as Telstra. Defence of their prime market will always be their No. 1 priority, and that is understandable. But it is hard to imagine that if profits are being squeezedâif profitability is undermined by the economic circumstances dictating their fateâa company such as Telstra will not react by withdrawing or minimising services to rural and regional areas, which are certainly not amongst their high-profit areas. The high-profit areas are clearly those based on Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Perth and a couple of other major cities in Australia; those are the major areas where profits are made.</para><para>Of course no government, regardless of its complexion, can predict the squeeze that might be on in the future. One can see the services that will be sacrificed are those services that are delivered to rural and regional areas. That would see a direct abrogation of a company's responsibility to universal service obligations. I cannot be convinced that anything else would ever happen. Undoubtedly, the letter of the law might be there, but one could envisage a corporate giant resorting to every which way to maintain its place in the market. Let us face it: even though Telstra is big, it is a very competitive market and there are new competitors likely to come on into the future. Do not ask me who; that is the nature of the marketplaceâit is vibrant. If Telstra finds itself under pressure at any stage, it will undoubtedly resort to shore up its place in the marketplace and maintain its profitability for its shareholders. At the end of the day, Telstra's responsibility is to provide a profit to its shareholders. If it finds that it has these unprofitable areas under its control, they will undoubtedly get pushed sideways and, in those circumstances, the consumer will suffer greatly. The obvious commercially expendable sector of the telco market would be the rural and regional subscribers. </para><para>I must say that I would be interested to see if we do hear from any of the senators from The Nationals in this debate, particularly from my stateâwhich would be Senator Boswell, whose name I did not see on the list. I am amazed that The Nationals have given a tick in a leap of blind faith to the full privatisation of Telstra. I am glad to see a nod from you, Mr Acting Deputy President, which indicates that Senator Boswell will be there. Clearly, the message that comes to me out of the rural and regional areas is one of grave concern about this move to the full privatisation of Telstra. That is borne out even in the minority report. I am not going to traverse it, but I would recommend it to people to see the concern that does exist out there. It is a real concern. As I have said, people see the service of telecommunications these days as being a basic, fundamental and essential service; not something that is optional. As it is not an option, as it is something that is essential, they cannot go down the path of seeing it passed into private hands whereby the fully privatised Telstra does not have a commitment to guarantee a level of service and a delivery of service which will enable those people to participate at an equal or near equal level with those in the more dense areas of our sparse nation.</para><para>That is a reasonable fear and a reasonable concern being expressed to people like me by constituents in the state of Queensland. I am sure that those who are in other states where there is the same degree of diversity as there is in Queensland, such as the state of Western Australia, would have exactly the same fears and concerns. The concerns do not have to be drummed up by anyone; they are just natural fears because of the experience of these people in the past. They know that the service that was promised has not been delivered, they know that they want to have a part and a role to play in a modern society, and they knowâas Senator Santoro saidâthey want to be part of a fully integrated global economy. They do not want to be left behind, but they do not want Telstra sold fully such that they get denied the right that everyone else in our community will have at their disposal.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>16842</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline> empowers the government to privatise the remaining government shareholding in Telstra. It also includes a number of other provisions, including the removal of various reporting obligations which presently apply to Telstra, the removal of the ministerial power of direction and the removal of Telstra from the scope of the freedom of information legislation.</para></talk.start><para>Let me say unequivocally at the outset that the Labor Party is absolutely opposed to this bill and the privatisation of Telstra in its full senseâas it has always been. This government has been trying to privatise Telstra for quite a long time now, and, thanks to the Nationals finally caving in to the Liberals, there is now an agreement to this sale. The Nationals have walked away from the real interests of their rural constituents. Our position has been quite clear, particularly since the last election when our leader, Simon Crean, announced that all policies would be up for negotiation except the sale of Telstra, which was not negotiable and not on as far as the Labor Party was concerned. </para><para>Telecommunications in this sparse country of ours is an essential part of life for all Australians. It is an essential service for day-to-day living, keeping in touch with family, for business, for health and education services and for emergency services. Telstra, then, being by far the largest provider of such services, is a public utilityâa public utility which is predominantly in a monopoly position. We are told by the government that this is not soâthat Telstra does not have a monopoly as there are 89 providers in Australia. However, this is simply not so for many Australians who live in rural and regional areas where Telstra is very often the single provider. In fact, approximately 95 per cent of profits in the telecommunications field are made by Telstra, which constitutes over two-thirds of the whole industry. This looks pretty much like a monopoly position to meâa very powerful, controlling position in an industry which is essential to so much of a life and work. It is therefore vital that public control is retained over Telstra.</para><para>Let us have a look at what this semiprivatised Telstra has done under the Howard government, particularly in rural and remote Australia. What has its control enabled Telstra to do? It is not a very reassuring record, let me tell you. In the past four years, its capital investment has dropped from $5.4 billion to $3.2 billion. Telstra has slashed staff numbers by over 13,000 in the past three years and more cuts are planned. These jobs have mainly been those out in the field, working on service maintenance and ensuring that people have access to services. In the same period, from 1999-2000, Telstra has managed to lose $2.5 billion in investments in Asiaâhardly a strong sign that Telstra sees itself as really responsible to Australians, even though the majority of shares are still government owned.</para><para>While Telstra has been losing money in Asia, the Howard government has allowed Telstra to increase income from Australian customers by raising the charges for line rentals at least 100 per cent in the last three years, going from $11.65 a month to $23.50 or more. It is not an encouraging picture for those living in remote areas: services barely maintained and costs rising. If full privatisation is allowed, things will only get worse. Telstra would then act solely for its shareholders. Charges would go up again, staff numbers would go down even more and less profitable areas out in the bush would be deserted, as has happened with the banks. Profits for shareholders would become the Holy Grail, and service, particularly in remote, more costly areas, would come a poor second.</para><para>Not only has Telstra slashed investment and staffing, put its fees up and lost billions of dollars in Asia but it has failed in the delivery of broadband services. Australia is now 19th in the OECD for the number of broadband connections in households. This is not a small issue: broadband technology is a fundamental issue for the development of regional Australia. With such access and the lower costs associated with land and rental prices, many more businesses would find it most worth while to relocate to regions, giving them that economic boost they so need. This would be great for the regions and for the nation as a whole but, to date, Telstra has used its dominant marketplace position to set the paceâand that, of course, has been a snail's pace at this stage. Limited regional broadband access has meant businesses remain in the cities and regional Australia still struggles for economic development. </para><para>My own electorate of the Northern Territory is very much rural and remote Australia. I constantly receive comments and complaints about aspects such as mobile phone coverage, slow Internet services or services which frequently drop out. I have only very recently received another complaint about the lack of broadband access in Palmerston, close to Darwin city. This email was received from a company that is highly involved in the development of ICT projects in remote areas of the Northern Territory. The email from the managing director says this:</para><quote><para>I have huge concerns about the privatisation of Telstra and the impact this will have in remote areas and the way it will restrict innovative ICT development in these areas due to costs.</para><para>When it comes to broadband services Telstra would have no interest in providing real solutions.</para><para>In relation to the Galiwinku Knowledge Centre project, a cultural system with commercial aspirations, the costs for Telstra in relation to placing a server online from the community was over 16,000.00 pa plus data charges!!</para></quote><para>That is $16,000 per annum plus data charges. The message goes on to say this:</para><quote><para>This is not even in the same ballpark as the costs for doing the same thing in Darwin. The Telstra costs have extreme negative impacts on projects from remote areas that require broadband. </para></quote><para>Further on he says:</para><quote><para>If they are privatised there will be less incentive to provide advanced services from remote areas. It will remain as yet another hurdle for people in remote areas to try to overcome.</para></quote><para>This next comment came from people in Katherine in relation to CDMA phone work in the Florina Road in Katherine. It is an issue that I have raised time and time again in this parliament and with Telstra; that is, the use of the pair gain facility in the Katherine region. But I would like this evening to table this photograph, for which I have received permission from the government whips, in relation to mobile phone coverage in Katherine, and before I table it I will describe it for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. This photo came with a message from people who live in Katherine. The message says this:</para><quote><para>Here's another Telstra challenge.</para><para>When the analogue network was closed down, I lost mobile phone services around my property.</para><para>I grow mangoes, usually work alone, and it was nice to have a life line around if things went wrong.</para><para>The analogue service was also useful during the 1998 floods. I was able to use my analogue phone to guide a helicopter to a landing site to pick up a mother and sick child who were near neighbours. I talked to Tindal tower on the phone, the tower relayed to the helicopter. Neither of the present mobile phone systems provide service in that place.</para></quote><para>The message goes on to say that a CDMA tower to service the Florina Road area in Katherine and beyond to the west of Katherine would be very useful.</para><para>There is a plea in this message that to get this service out of Telstra would be appreciated. But let me describe the picture for you. This is a picture of a mango farmer, sitting in a cherry picker some 10 to 15 metres high in the sky above a large patch of mango trees in the Katherine region, trying to use his mobile phone. So at this stage it would seem that, if you live in the Florina Road area and you are out on your property growing mangoes, about the only way to get coverage in that area is to do exactly what this man in the picture is doing: climb to the top of a cherry picker so that you can get some sort of signal. I seek leave to table that picture.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>âSo despite the best efforts of this government to try to convince everyone that things are going well with Telstra, try telling the man on the top of the cherry picker who is growing mangoes in Katherine that that is the case. The government seems to very conveniently ignore facts such as these and go on blindly saying that everything is fine, that services are adequate and that its conditions for the full privatisation of Telstra are being met. This is simply not so. Much of the Northern Territory still remains outside mobile phone range. The Internet is slow and unreliable and broadband access, even in the city, is not good. This government remains severely ideologically blinded to reality. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me just take a moment now to talk about what has happened in the other place in relation to Mr Tollner, the government member for the seat of Solomon. Mr Tollner has a history of not being too sure where he sits when it comes to the sale and privatisation of Telstra. Prior to the 2001 election, Mr Tollner stood up on a platform and said that he certainly would not be supporting the sale of Telstra unless there was continuous mobile phone coverage along the Stuart Highway and that conditions in the Northern Territory had improved. In fact, on ABC radio in May 2002 Mr Tollner, when asked if he still wanted to see continuous mobile phone coverage along the Stuart Highway before the sell-off of Telstra, said this:</para><quote><para>Look Fred that's certainly something that I'm pushing for, I want to see continuous coverage along the Stuart Highway.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>... there's still a bitâ</para></quote><para>of a wayâ</para><quote><para>to go. But it's certainly something that I want to see before I agree to privatisation of Telstra.</para></quote><para>In the same interview, he said:</para><quote><para>But all along I've always said that I want to see improvements in the bush particularly in the Northern Territory.</para></quote><para>He also said:</para><quote><para>But at this stage as I said to you I'd like to see more services in the Territory and I'm aware that a number of them are being rolled out.</para></quote><para>On 11 November 2002, just a couple of months later, when the ABC was again talking specifically about mobile phone coverage and the CDMA phones, Mr Tollner had this to say:</para><quote><para>Look firstly onto the full coverage of the Stuart Highway you will recall and listeners will recall that back in the election I said that I wouldn't be supporting the full sale of Telstra until the highway was full covered. Since then I've had some very technical briefings with a number of people from Telstra and also other telecommunication companies who tell me that logistically we're just not there at this stage.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>Look, unfortunately I do have to back away from that promise because I've been now convinced that it's not going to be possible.</para></quote><para>A little further on in the interview he is again asked:</para><quote><para>... are you now supporting the full sale of Telstra?</para></quote><para>And Mr Tollner replied:</para><quote><para>No I'm not at this stage ... both of usâ</para></quote><para>and I assume he is referring to Senator Nigel Scullionâ</para><quote><para>are fairly firm that we won't be supporting the sale of Telstra until the universal service obligations are expanded.</para></quote><para>So let us just skip ahead to August 2003âand this issue of the sale of Telstra just keeps popping up in the Northern Territory, doesn't it, boys; if only we could get our story right and consistent. On 21 August, Mr Tollner stuck up his hand in the House of Representatives and voted for the sale of Telstra. There he was, hand up high in the air, voting for the sale of Telstra. And what was his defence at that time? He said that mobile phone coverage up and down the Stuart Highway had not happened but that satellite coverage up and down the Stuart Highway has happened and that was enough to convince him to support the sale of Telstra. When interviewed by the ABC on 22 August, he said: </para><quote><para>The first and foremost is that it's in the best interests of Territorians particularly those out in the bush.</para></quote><para>He said that that was why he supported the sale of Telstra. Let us just go to the issue of whether or not you can get a satellite phone to cover you if you are travelling up and down the Stuart Highway. Mr Tollner has said that satellite phones are easily available and one can get a government subsidy towards the cost. That is indeed so, but what he failed to mentioned was that conditions applyâin fact, very strict conditions apply.</para><para>The subsidy is available only if you buy the phone outright. Telstra itself has only two satellite phones available. They cost $1,495 or $2,995, according to the type you want. However, the subsidy is available only if you live or work regularly beyond mobile coverage and is up to only 50 per cent of the cost or $1,100, whichever is the least. So to buy even the cheaper phone will cost the buyer $748 after the subsidy. The call costs include a 40c connection fee and up to 99c a minute, depending on which plan you take. So while satellite phones are available, as is the subsidy, they certainly are not a cheap alternative. They are certainly not what an average family could afford for keeping in touch with the rest of the country or for business or for education. And they certainly are not available if you are a resident of Darwin or Katherine, where you do have mobile phone coverage. So the excuse of hiding behind buying a satellite phone to get over the excuse for supporting the sale of Telstra is an absolute myth.</para><para>On 15 October, Mr Tollner was interviewed once more on ABC radio. He was asked whether or not the sale of Telstra should have proceeded and whether or not Telstra should have been privatised. But, oops, I think Mr Toller is a little confused here. He said:</para><quote><para>My concern is, and as I've told the party room and the CLP have told our friends in the coalition, we won't support it until we know that there's an ironclad guarantee that those services will always be comparable to what is provided in cities.</para></quote><para>But Mr Tollner, you must have forgotten: you put your hand up some two weeks before this interview and voted for the sale of Telstra. Perhaps there is still some confusion in the CLP camp in the Northern Territory. I notice that Senator Scullion's name is not even on the list of 28 speakers in the Senate to provide his contribution as to why he is going to support this bill. So we have a confused Mr Tollner, and Senator Scullion has gone into hiding on the issue.</para><para>The issue has been pointed out by Mr Snowdon in the House of Representatives, and the minister made a statement back in April 2002 that all places with 500 or more people would get CDMA or some alternative coverage. To date we still have communities, such as Wadeye, Galiwinku and Maningrida, with no such coverage. They in fact have heard nothing since April 2002, and they are amongst the biggest communities in the Northern Territory, each with a population of upwards of 1,700 people. If Telstra were to be privatised, these places could forget any service improvements. In fact, it has not been privatised and they are still at the bottom of the heap.</para><para>There have been many submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and their report on this bill was tabled today. The National Farmers Federation said in their submission to the inquiry:</para><quote><para>Farmers in rural Australia do not receive the same level of telecommunications service or services as urban Australians ... </para></quote><para>The Isolated Children's Parents Association of Australia, also in a submission to this committee's inquiry, said, among other things:</para><quote><para>ICPA (Aust) would still question the wisdom of a fully privatised telecommunication environment for regional, rural and remote Australia. </para></quote><para>They further stated:</para><quote><para>ICPA (Aust) would suggest that an inquiry into the feasibility of telecommunication infrastructure in regional, rural and remote Australia remaining Government owned should be conducted before any further sale of Telstra.</para></quote><para>These were submissions from organisations one would expect to be fairly conservative politically. In fact, many of them probably voted for The Nationals at the last election. Now they see themselves deserted, yet they are all concerned about the implications of any further sale of Telstra.</para><para>In closing, I say that the sale of Telstra represents bad policy for the public and bad competition policy. It is bad for the market and extremely bad for rural, regional and remote Australia. This proposal is being pursued purely because of blind ideology on the part of the Howard government, totally ignoring the information, opinion and feedback from the nation and even ignoring surveys carried out by their own very concerned backbench. Labor will oppose any further privatisation of Telstra and we propose that Telstra focus on its core responsibilities to the community: improving access to broadband to help economic development, improving competition and providing better consumer price control. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired</inline>)</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>16847</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a given that telecommunications are essential economic and social services, particularly in regional and rural areas. Telecommunications infrastructure is increasingly important in the context of the information economy. A very large number of people now need access to services such as e-commerce, e-learning, e-health and e-banking. A recent survey of rural community needs in Western Australia conducted by the Communications Expert Group showed very high levels of use of computers and the Web by rural businesses and individuals. In fact, 81 per cent of people in the Pilbara and 84 per cent of people in the Kimberley region used online services, compared to an average in metropolitan areas of just 70 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>While there is evidence to suggest that telecommunications in rural and remote areas have improved significantly in recent yearsâand advances in technology and a number of government initiatives have contributed to thisâthere is further evidence that services are still inadequate. The Regional Telecommunications Inquiry report, also known as the Estens report, concluded that telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote Australia were adequate. However, this conclusion was made on the basis that strategies were in place at that time to improve services over the next few years. The Senate committee inquiry heard from several individuals and organisationsâincluding Mr Dick Estens, author of the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry reportâthat Telstra's regional services as they currently stand are not up to scratch. The three major barriers to reliable and equitable telecommunications in regional and rural Australia are infrastructure development, so-called future proofing and regulation.</para><para>Because Telstra owns both the copper wire and the HFC network, enjoys a lack of competition and has, from what we can gather, very little by way of a strategy that does anything other than maximise shareholder value, there is very little incentive for Telstra to invest in its infrastructure. In 2002-03, Telstra reduced its capital expenditure by 7.5 per cent and, I understand, plans to further reduce capital expenditure in 2003-04 by 9.1 per cent. This is in a climate where the ACA has ordered Telstra to carry out urgent remedial work on no less than 54 rural exchanges and the September ACA Telecommunications <inline font-style="italic">Performance Monitoring Bulletin</inline> showed a continuous decline in the performance of Telstra's infrastructure. </para><para>By world standards, Australia's investment in telecommunications infrastructure is falling. Between 1988 and 1999, Australia was investing, on average, 1.7 per cent more than the OECD average. But in 2000 and 2001 that fell to just the OECD average. Low investment in infrastructure is impacting, and will continue to impact, on innovation, new service development and the implementation and maintenance of infrastructure, especially in regional and rural Australia. According to evidence to the committee from Telstra, it would cost Telstra $5 billion to increase Internet speed from 19.2 kilobits per second to 56 kilobits per second. By contrast, the government's response to the Estens report provided only $181 million in new funding, which is laughable. It is far short of the standards needed to deliver rural services.</para><para>Mr Dick Estens conceded that it will require progressively increasing levels of government regulation to push up rural standards. However, the government emphatically disagreed, arguing that it was not practical to say that there should be some kind of mandated service upgrade `because services change so quickly'. That is usually expressed by government departments and government members as the government not wanting to be in the business of picking winners; but, in our view, that is just a cop-out. The figures tell a very sorry tale about infrastructure. Between 1995 and 2000 Telstra's capital investment averaged between 22 and 27 per cent of its revenue. By 2003 it had slumped to just 15.5 per cent of revenue and it is projected to fall to less than 14 per cent this financial year. If Telstra were required to restore capital expenditure to 22 per cent of revenue, a level it has held for the last few years, it would increase capital spending by $1.35 billion a year, allowing, on Telstra's own estimates, a full overhaul of the network to a 56 kilobits per second standard in just four years.</para><para>The Democrats believe that it would not be unreasonable to ask the minister to use his powers under part 3 of the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to direct Telstra, in the national interest, to upgrade its full network to broadband capacity. When Senator Alston was the minister he tried to give away those powers but the Senate would not allow him to do that. I certainly hope Minister Williams is of a mind to use those important powers when it comes to the national interest.</para><para>The Estens report clearly indicated a need for long-term government leadership in telecommunications infrastructure as well as a need for ongoing government funding. However, with full privatisation, the government cannot possibly ensure incentives, requirements or obligations will be ongoing, when any future government can change them. Therefore, a key issue in terms of infrastructure and equitable services is future proofing. While strategies to address some of these issues have come out of the telecommunications service inquiry and the Estens report, the Democrats are concerned that they will be simply inadequate. For a start, the government has pledged funding to support the recommendations from the Estens report, but there are no guarantees that if another government came to power the funding promises would be met.</para><para>There are doubts that funding levels are adequate. For example, there are claims that the extra funds for mobile phone coverage will not be sufficient. More importantly, there are still telecommunications areas where strategies are not in place; for example, the inquiry heard evidence that there was an increasing necessity for higher bandwidth services such as ADSL in rural and regional areas, yet no recommendations came from the regional telecommunications inquiry report and there is no strategy in place to address the issue. The New South Wales Farmers Association summed up what many submissions and witnesses said. The association said: </para><quote><para>While the association welcomes the government's announcement that it would adopt all 39 recommendations from the Estens inquiry and would spend $181 million to improve services, the fact remains that until these efforts translate into better services for regional and rural Australia, and at comparable levels to city customers, then privatisation should not occur.</para></quote><para>It was also argued that Telstra would need to remain a presence in regional areas to maintain an understanding of the needs of regional communities and to provide the required level of service. There are concerns that a privatised Telstra will be more demanding of a commercial rate of return from all their assetsâand therefore more willing to close down low-return assets, as we have seen with many servicesâand will withdraw their presence in regional Australia.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum states that the bill provides that any licence condition made by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts requiring Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural or remote parts of Australia may empower the minister or the Australian Communications Authority to make decisions of an administrative nature. However, based on the current government record, the Democrats believe that the government would give more weight to the commercial imperative of Telstra and would be reluctant to intervene.</para><para>This current proposal to fully privatise Telstra in itself demonstrates the government's failure to act in the public interest. It has also been argued that market forces on their own can never provide rural Australia with the telecommunications services it needs. The National Farmers Federation said:</para><quote><para>The Government should provide targeted Government funding necessary to âfuture proofâ the ongoing provisions of equitable telecommunications services as new technologies emerge.</para></quote><para>The government argues that item 32 of schedule 1 to the billâpart 10, `Independent reviews of regional telecommunications'âis a future-proofing mechanism. However, the NFF argue that the provision does not guarantee any meaningful outcome. There are no provisions for a mechanism to require implementation of the independent review committee's recommendations or to ensure adequate funding. The NFF also argue that such a mechanism should be implemented independently of the bill and before the bill is passed.</para><para>Throughout the inquiry concerns were raised about the adequacy of current telecommunications regulation in ensuring efficient and effective telecommunications services and the ability of regulators to protect consumers' interests in a timely manner under current arrangements. The Consumers Federation of Australia argued:</para><quote><para>The current regulatory landscape delivers piecemeal and often unacceptable consumer outcomes ... It is seriously flawed to the extent that a safe, fair market cannot be assured and is not being reliably delivered.</para></quote><para>Concerns were raised by a number of groups about the reliance the legislative framework has placed on self-regulation and market forces. The Consumers Federation of Australia argues that many of the safeguards are delivered not through the reference to the legislation but by a complex system of self-regulatory codes that are not accessible to ordinary consumers. </para><para>Specifically, the Consumers Federation of Australia pointed to problems with Telstra's failure in its compliance, complaints handling, fair contract terms, reliable billing systems and accurate debt collection activities. The disproportionately high number of complaints to the ACCC about telecommunications issues is another indication that regulation is failing. The Consumers Federation has a fear that without adequate regulation there are no guarantees that services will be maintained and that new technology will be introduced in regional Australia.</para><para>The New South Wales Farmers Association argued at the Dubbo hearing:</para><quote><para>There is no apparent mechanism within the Bill to ensure that breaches of the USO and the CSG would trigger automatic penalties for the carriersâan important issue in terms of reassurance about the effectiveness of these regulatory measures in the post privatisation era.</para></quote><para>In their submission the New South Wales Farmers Federation said they are opposed to any further privatisation of Telstra until regulations are in place which would deliver comparable services and costs between metropolitan and the rural Australia guaranteed in legislation; timely and affordable access to future technology for rural and regional Australia guaranteed under the universal service obligation; the USO, including data standards as well as telephony services; the establishment of a permanent trust fund with 10 per cent of the proceeds from T3 to support the provision of high-quality telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia; customer service guarantees criteria that are met for each customer categoryâin other words, urban, major regional, minor regional, remoteâin each state rather than just the national average; the inclusion in the CSG criteria of a better measure of carrier performance and volume faults, and new installs that would be based on geographic not demographic criteria; and the definition of automatic penalties and a rectification process for breaches of the USO and CSG in legislation.</para><para>The effectiveness of regulators such as ACA and ACCC to prevent and redress anti-competitive behaviour in a timely and cost-effective manner has also been questioned. A number of submissions to the inquiry made recommendations regarding changes to the role of regulators and these included an adjustment to the role of the ACCC to include responsibility for price approval of access prices, monitoring and enforcement of the price control regime; an adjustment of the role of the ACA to that of ensuring pro-competitive outcomes and to strengthening its focus on securing consumer outcomes from the industry; a strengthening of the role of the ACCC, especially in the disclosure of information to enable the quick resolution of access to claims and to ensure more equitable or more even contract conditions and prices; appropriate resourcing of the ACA, the ACCC and the TIO; and that the ACCC and the ACA should be invited to make recommendations in their annual performance reports, which the minister should be required to respond to, including explanations where recommendations are not accepted.</para><para>The Consumers Federation of Australia also raised concerns that: </para><quote><para>If the consumer protection arrangements in telecommunications are inadequate to respond to the current market in which the largest market participant is majority public owned, what hope is there of that system responding to the sort of dominance Telstra would have if fully privatised?</para></quote><para>The government argues that a partially privatised Telstra is like being half pregnant and that the government is in a difficult role as major shareholder and regulator. But government ownership and regulation of the industry is neither incompatible nor illogical in our view. While the government argues that the ability to regulate Telstra effectively does not rely on the government's majority or part ownership of the company, the New South Wales Farmers Association rightly argues: </para><quote><para>Post-privatisation, the weight of shareholder expectations and Telstra corporate influence will make it extremely difficult to implement changes or enhancements to the regulatory framework under which the corporation operates.</para></quote><para>In response to a question by Senator Tchen, who raised witnesses' concerns about the government's ability once Telstra is privatised to effectively regulate the industry, ACCC Commissioner Mr Ed Willett responded by suggesting:</para><quote><para>It is more consistent with the principles of good policy that these sorts of changesâ</para></quote><para>that is, regulatory changesâ</para><quote><para>are made prior to privatisation ... That is why we wanted to highlight some issues of concern that we saw in the Emerging Structures Report ... It is certainly better to make those sorts of changes now, before full privatisation.</para></quote><para>More importantly, the government has previously stated that it will not privatise unless it is in the public interest. Yet the evidence is clear that regulatory failure is occurring. Clearly, the regulatory structure needs to be overhauled and meaningful future-proofing mechanisms need to be developed before full privatisation proceeds. I want to make the point again that the Democrats are opposed to the privatisation of Telstra. No good case has been made by the government now or in the previous two tranches of the sale and, even if it had, this government has demonstrated absolutely its unwillingness to protect consumers and customers of Telstra through investment or through regulation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>16851</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1840">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003</inline>. I am absolutely opposed to any further sale of Telstra and along with my Labor colleagues will be opposing this bill all the way. Telstra must remain in majority democratic public ownership and it must provide all Australians with access to high-quality and affordable telecommunications services, no matter where, across the length and breadth of this immense country in which we live. Public ownership is the only guarantee we have of ensuring that all Australians, no matter where they live, are able to access essential, reliable and affordable telecommunications services. The remaining Commonwealth equity in Telstra must not be sold. We on this side of the chamber recognise telecommunications services to be essential services. That is why we place such great importance on ensuring that the only majority publicly owned telecommunications company in this country, with social obligations to the Australian people underwritten by law, remains just that.</para></talk.start><para>We view telecommunications services as essential services in this, the digital age; the Howard government, in clear contrast, views them as luxury services and items that Australians could easily do without. The Howard government view is out of touch, ignorant and driven by ideology rather than sense. We recognise, as I think most Australians would recognise, that 21st century Australians rely on telephones and broader telecommunications services just to exist in everyday, ordinary life. We use them to keep in touch with loved ones and families, friends, colleagues and acquaintances; we organise social lives with them; we conduct business and consume via them; we use them to access emergency services, help and advice; and we undertake household chores such as paying bills and dealing with companies with them. To suggest that telecommunications services are not fundamental to the everyday machinations of today's society is simply misleading; everyone knows they are. </para><para>For many years now, the Howard government has been hell-bent on fulfilling its ideological dream of fully privatising Telstra. It has been fattening it up for many years and has effectively allowed it to act as if it were already a company fully in private hands. In turn, Telstra's performance in numerous areas of its operations has been allowed to slip and slide all over the place. For example, Telstra's network has been deteriorating for some time, crippled by major investment reductions and mass staff cutbacks. Telstra's hefty investments in Asia have backfired, resulting in enormous financial losses for the company and its shareholders. Consumers have been hit with rapidly escalating Telstra line rental fees, yet have not been adequately compensated with reductions in call prices. Telstra has been operating in a market dogged by inadequate competition and has usedâand some might argue abusedâits market dominance and control of the fixed line network.</para><para>At the end of 2001, Telstra controlled 83 per cent of the local call market, 86 per cent of the basic access market, 72 per cent of the long distance market, 50 per cent of the international market, 50 per cent of the mobile telephony market, 53 per cent of the pay TV market and 96 per cent of the directories market. In overall terms, Telstra occupies approximately 75 per cent of the Australian telecommunications market and earns over 90 per cent of the profits in that market. Telstra's roll out and take-up of broadband technology compared with equivalent countries has been poor and totally inadequate, and Telstra's focus on moving into other sectors, such as media and information technology management, has been occurring at the expense of its traditional responsibilities. These deficiencies have been exacerbated by inappropriate corporate behaviour, such as supplying $15,000 plasma televisions for free to the Prime Minister and the former communications minister, Senator Alston, and offering CEO Ziggy Switkowski a $1 million-plus golden handshake if he were to be sacked, which would come on top of his $7 million salary package.</para><para>Telstra's capital expenditure has fallen dramatically. From a peak of $4.7 billion in 1999-2000, Telstra's financial commitment to capital infrastructure fell to an estimated $3.25 billion in 2002-03, representing a 30 per cent decline in infrastructure investment since the 1999-2000 year alone. Over that same period, the number of full-time staff slashed from Telstra's workforce has reached over 13,000. Full-time staff numbers have fallen from 50,761 to an estimated 37,600. A substantial proportion of these staff cuts have occurred in areas where employees were involved in direct customer service and network maintenance activities, particularly in regional Australia. As a consequence, Telstra's services and service standards around the country, and in particular in the country's rural and regional areas, have been seriously deficient.</para><para>All the while, however, prices have been increasing. Just three and a bit years ago the price for having a telephone in your home, without including a single cent for a call, was $11.65 per month. Today that figure has reached between $23.50 and $26.50 a month. In the next year or two it is expected to rise to over $30 per month. So, within the space of four or five years, the price for the privilege of having a phone in your home, before you pay a single cent for a telephone call, is going to soar to well over $400 per year. Many consumers are now complaining that they are paying more in line rental charges than in call costs. Australians have every right to be concerned about what a fully privatised Telstra might charge customers in the future and about the decisions they might make with respect to particular services they offer customers today. While Telstra customers have been hit with massive price hikes in line rental fees over the last few years, they have also been disadvantaged by Telstra's decision to axe the popular 15c local neighbourhood call feature. Australians recognise that programs such as discounts and concession schemes for pensioners will be immediately cut or scaled back if Telstra is sold. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>16853</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

These voyages were not the first by the highly skilled Chinese navigators, as it is thought that voyages of exploration to Australia commenced probably as early as the time of the Sui dynasty in the period 589 AD to 618 AD. The Chinese had known from these times of a great landmass 100 days sailing south of Asia. The Chinese historians of that era described an animal that inhabited this landmass as having the head of a deer, a second head in the middle of its body, which presumably is the joey in the kangaroo's pouch, and hopping on its hind legs.</para></talk.start><para>By the time Marco Polo had reached China in the 13th century there were certainly kangaroos in the Imperial Zoo in Beijing. Marco Polo also described in his chronicles the existence, as depicted by Chinese charts, of two Javasâthe island we know today as Java and a landmass called Greater Java, which was further south and which he described as the largest landmass in the world. This landmass certainly had to be the continent of Australia. By the time the great Chinese fleet of Emperor Zhu Di left China on 8 March 1421 it is very clear that this great southern continent was well known to the Chinese. The ships of this fleet were under the command of the Emperor's loyal eunuch admirals. They commanded ships of massive dimensionânearly 500 feet long. They ventured forth on an epic voyage of discovery that is arguably one of the greatest voyages of exploration ever undertaken by man. By way of comparison to the size of the vessels the Chinese constructed, Columbus's three ships, the <inline font-style="italic">Nina</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Pinta</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Santa Maria</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline> were somewhere between 50 and 60 feet long; the Chinese vessels were 500 feet long.</para><para>Admiral Hong Bao, in his great voyage, journeyed further south than man had ever done before in our region, reaching and charting Antarctica for the first time. He had sailed across the southern latitudes, charted the east coast of South America and navigated the Strait of Magellan long before Magellan did. He travelled as far south as the South Shetland Islands, skirting the pack-ice, charting as he went, and from there travelled east to the Heard and Kerguelen islands as we now know them. From there he picked up the roaring forties and reached the west coast of Australia, making his landfall somewhere near where the town of Bunbury is located today. It is thought that he then ventured further north and anchored in the Swan estuary where he rested his significantly battered fleet after such a harrowing voyage.</para><para>The Rotz charts of the Portuguese cartographers of the Dieppe school heavily relied upon these early Chinese charts for their maps produced a few centuries later. The Rotz map clearly shows the indentation where the Swan estuary is located. It is further documented that two ancient shipwrecks that pre-date Portuguese and Dutch explorers were located in this general area in Western Australia. Admiral Hong Bao's fleet had taken the first voyagers ever to sail through the Strait of Magellan. They had discovered the Antarctic continent and reached southern Australia over two centuries before the great Dutch navigator Abel Tasman, who is also generally accepted as being the first of the European explorers to discover the great southern continent of Australia in the early 17th century. </para><para>Whilst Admiral Hong Bao prepared to return home to China, another of the great Chinese navigators, Admiral Zhou Man, was sailing along southern latitudes in the opposite direction, making for Australia, crossing the Pacific a good 100 years before Magellan, who until recently had generally been accepted as being the first to cross this ocean.</para><para>The Rotz chart shows in great detail the east coast of Australia. However, it is the physical evidence of what these great Chinese mariners left behind them that provides the most compelling evidence of their visits to our shores so long ago. In the 1840s a ruined fortress was found by Benjamin Boyd at Bittangabee Bay near Eden in the far south of New South Wales. As the crow flies, it is not too far distant from where we sit tonight. Bittangabee's substantial ruins comprise a square platform surrounded by large rocks that once formed a defensive wall. Foundations and parts of the walls of a blockhouse formed by large stones bound with mortar lie inside the perimeter wall. To construct this fortress would have taken a large number of men to bring the stones to the site and then to dress and to erect them. There is no evidence of the local Aboriginal population undertaking this type of building or construction method, either here or anywhere else in Australia for that matter. Further evidence of the age of these ruins comes from the dating of a tree that has substantial roots growing under the structure, which confirms that the construction took place long before the first British inhabitants arrived in the 18th century. More stone buildings erected before European settlement can be found just south of Sydney where a group of 20, like a small village, are set beside the coast and there are well-built paths leading from a small reservoir to a 15-metre stone wharf beside the sea.</para><para>However, the most compelling evidence for the date of these first visits comes from the evaluation of several shipwrecks, especially one found near Byron Bay. Two wooden pegs were unearthed at the site and provisionally carbon dated to the mid-15th century. Before sandmining began in the area it was locally described that three masts protruded from the sand and parts of the hull were visible. In 1965 the sandminers at Byron Bay unearthed a huge wooden rudder from the site that was said to be some 40 feet in length. This rules out entirely any Dutch or Portuguese ships as they were not much bigger than the rudder itself. Remember, the Chinese ships of this great expeditionary fleet were up to 500 feet in length, so the size of the rudder of the dimensions found at Byron Bay suggests that ships similar to those of the Chinese had been in this area and been wrecked. Further, the wreckage of another ancient ship found near Wollongong, another two found in swampland close to Perth and the `mahogany' wreck found near Warrnambool provide further substantiation of these great Chinese voyages of discovery.</para><para>An exhibition at the La Trobe Library some 20 years ago displayed a map from the Dieppe cartography school which showed the coast around Brisbane with remarkable precision and accuracy. Stradbroke Island, Moreton Island, the Pine River and the lagoon at Surfers Paradise are all clearly discernible. To have surveyed it with such precision, the Chinese fleet must have spent a considerable amount of time in the area. They stayed such a long time in the area because of the discovery of mineral deposits around Gympie. In this area, there have been discoveries of open-cast copper, tin and gold mines that pre-date European times. People constructed a 100-foot high pyramid at the location of these mines, similar to others at various locations around the world, to provide a readily identifiable marker of their discoveries. This pyramid, although badly vandalised, survives to this day. </para><para>When Zhou Man resumed his voyage north up the Great Barrier Reef he charted the whole area with great precision and accuracy. The wealth of detail that is evident on the Rotz chart suggests that up to 10 Chinese ships sailing abeam of each other, on either side of the reef, navigated and charted these dangerous waters. This incredible feat paved the way for later explorers who had access to detailed information through the charts of Rotz and others of the Dieppe school who relied almost exclusively on the work of these incredible Chinese navigators.</para><para>The later voyages of Cook and other early European explorers were voyages of great importance and national significance but were pre-empted by the quite astounding explorations of these Chinese admirals. Our history books should make greater acknowledgment of their feats. Tonight, time prevents me from further detailed discussion of these monumental voyages of exploration and discovery. However, I would like to concur with President Hu Jintao's statement that the Chinese fleets of 1421 did in fact visit our shores and left signposts that guided many other subsequently great and courageous explorers to our shores. I direct senators who have an interest in this area to read the excellent work of Gavin Menzies in his book <inline font-style="italic">1421âThe Year China Discovered the World</inline>. I am indebted to Gavin Menzies, a Royal Navy submariner, and his outstanding research that has greatly assisted me in my understanding of this aspect of our history.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Breast Cancer</title><page.no>16855</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>16855</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMany people would know that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and today is Pink Ribbon Day. Today is the day when a lot of us purchase pink ribbons, wear pink ribbons, wear pink orâif you have got anything to do with BA, Robyn or Senator Ferrisâeat pink food at morning tea just to celebrate all people in this country, particularly women, getting together to raise funds and raise awareness of breast cancer. Nationally, as many as seven women die from breast cancer every day. That is a staggering number of women in this country. That is around 50 women a week, which is more than Australia's national road toll. One woman in 11 will be diagnosed with breast cancer before they are aged 75. Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer related deaths in women in Australia. Breast cancer is also the second most common cancer amongst women after non-melanoma skin cancer. From 1990 to 1999 the breast cancer death rate declined by an average of 1.9 per cent per year.</para></talk.start><para>Finding breast cancer early is critical in providing effective treatment for breast cancer, and that is why heightening the awareness of breast cancer amongst as many people as possible is so important. Trials of mammographic screening demonstrated that early detection and treatment could reduce deaths from breast cancer in women aged 50 to 69 by up to 30 per cent. The risk of breast cancer increases with age: 25 per cent of new breast cancer cases diagnosed in 1999 were in fact from women aged 20 to 49, 48 per cent in women aged 50 to 69 and 27 per cent in women aged 70. Women whose cancer is diagnosed before it has spread outside the breast have a 90 per cent chance of surviving five yearsâthe magical five years, as Susan Tulley said over the weekendâcompared with a 20 per cent chance of surviving five years when the cancer is spread at diagnosis. </para><para>I want to also use the opportunity tonight to talk about activities in the Northern Territory, particularly the fifth anniversary of the Northern Territory Breast Cancer Voice and Dragons Abreast in the Northern Territory. I had the absolute honour and delight to attend a gala banquet last Friday night in Darwin called a `Celebration of Life'. It was held, of course, in October, in Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and it was held to commemorate the fact that NT Breast Cancer Voice and Dragons Abreast have reached their fifth anniversary. Let me just tell you for a minute about the Northern Territory Breast Cancer Voice. It is a Territory advocacy group of breast cancer survivors and supporters that also includes the Dragons Abreast NT team. I have spoken about this group before in this chamber. Their mission is to promote breast cancer awareness. In the last five years, they have done some outstanding things and have had many wonderful achievements that highlight the energy and enthusiasm that these women have for ensuring that everyone knows about breast cancer.</para><para>They have produced journey folders, a simple idea to store a person's test results in one place. This has now been adopted as a national initiative by the breast cancer national advocacy group. They were the Australian face of the breast cancer calendar 2000, which was produced in the Northern Territory and sold Australia wide. This group has also donated books on breast cancer issues to the Darwin City Council library. Dragons Abreast Northern Territory are a dragon boat team that, from a small beginning on Lake Alexander in December 1998, have now spread Australia wide. There are teams in every state and every territory of Australia. The Northern Territory Breast Cancer Voice also hold an annual luncheon at Government House, a very special event exclusively for breast cancer survivors. Members of the group sit on the National Breast Cancer Centre committees, provide speakers to national and international conferences, were part of a group to successfully lobby for the drug Herceptin to be placed on the PBS list, and brought to Darwin the `Surviving Survival' workshop with Professor Miles Little and his team from the University of New South Wales, which included a session for health professionals.</para><para>They are also the group behind Dragons Abreast, and their mission is to offer hope and inspiration to women faced with a diagnosis of breast cancer and promote the fact that there is quality of life after breast cancer. Dragons Abreast was actually inspired by a Canadian group called Abreast in a Boat, which was established under Dr Don McKenzie from the Allan McGavin Sports Medicine Centre at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. He set up a study to demonstrate that exercise is beneficial for breast cancer survivors. Dragon boat racing was chosen because it is strenuous, it is repetitive for upper body activity, and simply pulling harder can vary the intensity of the training. It has also been shown, of course, that there are improved physical and mental health outcomes for those who participate in this activity. There were no new cases of lymphoedema, and those who already had lymphoedema displayed no adverse effects.</para><para>The Australian breast cancer dragon boat movement started when a group of Territory women attended the first national breast cancer conference for women held in Canberra in October 1998. From there on the seed was sown, and Michelle Hanton returned to Darwin inspired to see the same thing happening in Australia. The first survivor paddlers took to the water at a fun day hosted by Dragon Boat Northern Territory. From that very small beginning we now have a nationwide movement. There are currently Dragons Abreast groups right across Australia, and the movement continues to grow. In fact, next week here in Canberra the masters of the Dragons Abreast paddling will occur. Senator Marise Payne and I will be hosting an afternoon tea for all the women who are involved in Dragons Abreast championships and competitions next week. </para><para>I want to pay tribute to the people who are behind the Northern Territory Breast Cancer Voice and Dragons Abreast. In particular, one would have to be absolutely speechless when trying to find the words to explain and convey the degree of enthusiasm that Michelle Hanton has for this movement. She is the National Coordinator of Dragons Abreast. She is also behind the Northern Territory Breast Cancer Voice. She has done some outstanding and magnificent things to raise the awareness of breast cancer, not only in the Northern Territory but throughout this country. She is assisted by people like Susan Tulleyâwho, I must say after last Saturday night, perhaps should give up her day job of nursing in the Darwin Hospital and become an MC, because she did quite a good jobâPenny La Sette and other members of their committee. These are people who have been affected by breast cancer, who have survivedâsome of them, as Susan Tulley said, have reached the magical five yearsâand who now want to share their experiences with other people and to heighten the awareness of breast cancer amongst women in our community and nationwide.</para><para>I want to pay tribute to people like Carly Vandermolen, a young woman who had the courage last Friday night to stand up and publicly share her experiences about the impact of breast cancer on her family and on her aunt. I also want to pay tribute to a young woman, 14-year-old Jessica Mauboy, who sang some pretty emotional songs for the group that night. She had an outstanding voice for a 14-year-old. These are young women who are prepared to support Breast Cancer Voice in the Northern Territory and to continue to spread the message.</para><para>Caring for You, an initiative of Berlei, was also in the Northern Territory last Friday night. My thanks go to people like Ros Hill, who was the compere for the fashion parade; to Jane and Shirley, who were in the Northern Territory to continue to support women and provide them with the self-esteem and the confidence to carry on even though they have been diagnosed with breast cancer; and to companies in the Northern Territory like Paspaley Pearls, Royal Brunei, Sporting Bet and Carlton United, who continue to support these groups to ensure that they continue their work to raise awareness of breast cancer and to ensure that everybody in our community understands, supports and appreciates the work that they are doing.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employee Share Ownership</title><page.no>16857</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>16857</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe debate about the full privatisation of Telstra earlier today gave the Senate an opportunity to reflect on some more incidental but nonetheless extremely important issues about contemporary Australia. One question, for example, arises: who will buy the shares in Telstra that the government wants to sell? The answer is very simple: many, many ordinary working Australians who want to invest in their own future security and in the country's wealth. How do we know this? Because of the number of Australians who took advantage of the earlier tranches of Telstra's sale to do just that.</para></talk.start><para>Indeed, the case of Telstra's privatisation has underlined an astonishing transformation in our society over the past 15 or so years. In 1986, nine per cent of us directly owned shares. That rose to 20 per cent by 1997 and stood at 37 per cent in 2002, and that does not count the indirect shares we own through superannuation fundsâa further 13 per centâand through the investments in shares that governments of various sorts make on behalf of taxpayers. Australia has become a share owning and a share trading society. The proportion of Australians directly investing in shares quadrupled over just 15 years, under both Labor and coalition governments. </para><para>It behoves us therefore to consider how we might foster and direct this spirit of share ownership in the future. I rise tonight to argue in this context for greater focus on a particular form of shareholdingâthat is, employee share ownership. In one of his first political speeches, in 1897, Winston Churchill declared:</para><quote><para>Ultimately I hope that the labourer will become a shareholder in the business in which he works.</para></quote><para>Almost half a century later he stated his desire:</para><quote><para>... to make the status of the wage earner that of partner rather than irresponsible employee.</para></quote><para>Today, we all have a vested interest in encouraging this particular brand of capitalism. Rising living standards and greater diversification of workers' assets is good news from any angle. Contrary to the rhetoric of the other side of the chamber, the federal government is committed to good outcomes for the workers in this nation. Since it came to office, an extra 490,000 full-time jobs have been created, and about as many part-time jobs as well. There has been a 12 per cent increase in full-time average weekly earnings, including a nine per cent increase for the lowest paid, and the lowest number of strikes on record.</para><para>This government introduced the first ever national safety net schemes to help compensate employees who have lost financial entitlements due to their employer's insolvency. The award system has been simplified and the coalition's framework for workplace agreements has given businesses and workers greater choice in negotiating working conditions. The opposition's record provides a stark contrast. Labor's award system placed limits on part-time work and forced workers wanting to balance work and family into casual work. Complex award rules and regulations made lawyers and union bosses more powerful than employers and employees. Under the Hawke and Keating governments, 221,000 workers lost $1.25 billion in entitlements; the government of the day did nothing to assist them. Between 1983 and 1996, the low paid suffered a 3.1 per cent fall in real wages. This begs the question: who really is the workers' party of this nation?</para><para>Superficially, employee share ownership may seem to be low on the list of workers' priorities. Job security, employment conditions and flexibility are perhaps more important considerations. Nevertheless, employee share ownership has a role to play in strengthening the social and economic framework of the nation. One of the unsavoury features of modern politics is the tendency to play the man and not the ball. I think we should judge ideas on their merits. One idea that was put forward by a person with whom I have little agreement, Karl Marx, was that industrial capitalism generated alienation because the wage earner was divorced from the product of his labourâthat rather than working for himself, he was just a factor of production, a cog in an assembly line who had no relationship with what he made. The situation for Western workers is now a great deal better than that endured by workers during Marx's time. Western capitalism now has cleaner industries, offers more stimulating and challenging work and, above all, provides an unsurpassed material standard of living in exchange for that labour.  </para><para>Yet it would be naive to believe this means all workers gain personal fulfilment from their work, particularly workers in some industries. An advantage of employee share ownership is that it gives workers a stake in the workplace other than just their wages. It provides an incentive for workers to increase productivity and to offer suggestions for better business practices. Employee share ownership is a reconciling force between capital and labour, by giving workers the chance to become genuine stakeholders. It drives home the economic truth that workers and mangers have many more things in common than divide them and it provides employees with a form of economic education. Sustainable real wage increases fundamentally depend on productivity, which allies the interests of employers and employees. Workers, and indeed unions, have realised for some time that wage negotiations are no longer a zero sum game but can produce mutually beneficial outcomes.</para><para>Recently, the Treasurer announced proposed corporate law reforms that would give employees the right to participate in a non-binding vote on executive salaries. That plan reflects the new, more democratic, spirit of Australian entrepreneurship. A renewed commitment to employee share ownership would complement this as shareholders are more likely to take an active interest in a company if they are also employees of that company. There is a great deal of scope for a further boost in employee share ownership in Australia. Although 37 per cent or so of Australians directly own shares, just six per cent of Australians have shares in their own workplaces, and a large number of these shareholders belong to the management of various companies. </para><para>Employee share ownership can alert workers to economic realities. One of these is the fact that each business is unique and wage rises that can be successfully absorbed by one enterprise may not be absorbed by another. An increase in employee share ownership may lead to workers achieving enterprise consciousness and forming their own enterprise unions rather than choosing to belonging to unresponsive mega unions. The Nelson inquiry into employee share ownership not long ago stated that employee share plans can be `used as a substitute for salary or wages when the business is not performing well.' </para><para>The last two decades have seen a wide range of research projects conducted into employee ownership in the United States. A correlation has been demonstrated between increased company performance and employee share ownership, particularly when workers have a role in the management of the company. Earlier this year the Australian government established an employee share ownership development unit within the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The unit will encourage schemes in businesses of all types and sizes and will focus on broad based schemes rather than executive schemes. The unit was set up as part of the government's response to the Nelson inquiry into employee share ownership. Recommendations made by the report included taxation changes, improved monitoring arrangements and greater promotion of employee share ownership. </para><para>Taxation concessions and exemptions may also need to be considered if we are going to promote the concept of employee share ownership more widely in Australia. That means re-examining division 13A of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and I think it is a very appropriate and timely measure to be considering. An increased culture of employee share ownership may have a positive effect on Australia's small to medium enterprises. A high level of employee share ownership means the possibility of a worker buy-out of a business when an owner decides to sell. That would retain corporate memory and expertise in that business. The philosophy underpinning employee share ownership is a sound one and I am pleased the government has a commitment to it. The challenge now is to develop a framework that gives it a boost in Australia. Under the coalition this seems possible because we have a demonstrated commitment to the best outcomes for workers as well as a commitment to corporate accountability. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Breast Cancer</title><page.no>16860</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>16860</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to add to comments made by Senator Crossin earlier this evening in relation to breast cancer. I, too, have been honoured to have taken part again this year in the events to recognise and support those who have battled breast cancer. Breast cancer continues to be the greatest cancer risk facing Australian women, with now a one in eleven lifetime risk. </para></talk.start><para>Every year at this time we remember and support those who have battled breast cancer. In this fortnight a series of events has been held to urge support for research into this major disease affecting women and to support those who are battling breast cancer. Today is Pink Ribbon Day. A group of breast cancer survivors hosted a Pink Ribbon Day morning tea here in Parliament House this morning. They thank senators and staff for the great support they received and they hope now to make this an annual event. Yesterday, in the ACT there was a Dragons Abreast regatta and a pink lady motorcycle ride as well as a silent walk to a mini `Field of Women'âpunctuated by the heartrending stories of victims and survivors and a rousing rendition of the mammogram song.</para><para>Other events continue this week and next week in the ACT and in other cities around the country. On Friday, 7 November the National Breast Cancer Centre is cosponsoring, with Breast Cancer Network Australia, a breast cancer forum at the National Library, at which progress and priorities will be discussed by keynote speakers. The Warrior Women Exhibitionâa mixed media exhibition which explores the experience of breast cancerâwill continue at Regatta Point until 8 November, coinciding with the Australian Masters Games. I am very excited that Dragons Abreast events will feature in this year's Masters Games to be held here in Canberra next week. One event will be especially only for women who have had breast cancer.</para><para>When we launched the Field of Women here in Canberra in 1998 the 10,000 pink silhouettes represented the number of Australian women breast cancer sufferers then diagnosed annually. This year the Field of Women was held in Hobart yesterday, and there are now 11,000 pink silhouettes. In other words, the incidence of breast cancer has risen by a thousand per year in the last five years. There are also 100 blue silhouettes to mark the approximate number of Australian men diagnosed each year with breast cancer. Although this increase in the incidence of breast cancer is worrying the good news is the decline for the first time in the mortality rate. This decline may have resulted from improved treatments, the greater community awareness of the importance of early detectionâand I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Breast Cancer Network and congratulate them on their fantastic work in the communityâand the national mammography screening program. </para><para>But the increased numbers do mean an increased need for services and support. Some of the problems that are still experienced include the fact that women in rural and remote areas need assistance with access and travel and that systems for funding breast prostheses and patient travel are often not working well. Although the numbers of breast cancer nurses have increased, the increased number of those diagnosed means that many more are needed to provide the necessary information, support and care. A shortage of specialist staff has also resulted in quite long delays being experienced by some women in receiving their mammography results. </para><para>More support is needed for young women with breast cancer, especially those with young children. Women under 55 are not entitled to free mammographies, even when a lump is found. Access to support programs and early screening is needed by this group. Lack of entitlement to services such as free mammograms and the financial costs involved for young women diagnosed as requiring screening can result in treatment delays. Under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, benefits are payable for this procedure as long as it is provided by a diagnostic imaging specialist, there is a reason to suspect the presence of a malignancy and the referral specifically requests a mammography. The age of the patient is not considered relevant, provided the criteria specified in the Medicare Benefits Schedule are met. Surely, though, when a doctor has reason to suspect breast cancer in a younger woman the free mammography service should be provided to her in a speedy, reassuring and accessible way.</para><para>Another problem which appears likely to arise is a shortage of specialist breast surgeons. Increasingly there are calls for specialist training for breast surgeons to include an understanding of tumour biology, breast reconstruction and special communications skills. Relatively few mastectomy patientsâeight per cent is quoted in a recent report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australia and New Zealand Journal of Surgery</inline>âhave breast reconstruction, probably because of costs, high gap fees for privately insured patients and logistical difficulties such as inadequate cooperation between reconstructive and cancer surgeons.</para><para>A provocative article in the United Kingdom circulated from the <inline font-style="italic">Independent</inline> questioned the wisdom of continuing to spend so much on cancer research, arguing that we should spend less on basic research and more on early detection and prevention. What progress has been made, it was argued, has been a result of lifestyle changes or discoveries made over three decades ago, such as tamoxifen for breast cancer.</para><para>It is true that we have not yet even identified the cause of breast cancer. We have identified many factors which statistically increase the risk of a person developing breast cancer. The two major factors that we know increase the risk markedly are being female and becoming older. The lifetime risk of developing male breast cancer is one in 1,800; in women the risk is one in 11. Other possible factors which have been debated and researched include family history, hormone replacement therapy, obesity, age at giving birth and breastfeeding history.</para><para>Yet there have been encouraging reports of successful trials of new drugs. Australian researchers have featured in some of these developments. For example, Australian Cancer TechnologyâAustCancerâhas been working on a vaccine, pentrix, to stimulate an immune response against cancer. Successful trials in Canada have centred on letrozol, marketed in Australia as femara. This has been used as a replacement drug for tamoxifen, which apparently can cause problems after the five-year course of treatment.</para><para>A report in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> dated 2 October 2003 claimed that the drug anast-rozole, with the brand name arimidex, may prevent up to 70 per cent of breast cancers and be more effective than tamoxifen. However, it will be seven to 10 years before the trial by Cancer Research in the UK delivers its results. Finally, other reports from the UK have claimed a 30 per cent cut in the number of breast cancer deaths through a new treatment involving the use of the drug epirubicin. I hope I have done justice to the various pronunciations of these drugsâI felt that it was important to reflect upon them in the chamber this evening. </para><para>We cannot afford to abandon this valuable research work. We must continue to strengthen the cooperation and coordination between Australian and international breast cancer groups to ensure sharing of information and building on that information. In Australia we have worked to coordinate the roles of breast cancer support and information groups so that duplication is minimised. The National Breast Cancer Centre, which was established seven years ago, has worked to provide information, monitor incidents and treatment and improve breast cancer outcomes. This year it has developed support packages to help the partners of breast cancer sufferers to understand their needs and provide support.</para><para>Breast Cancer Network Australia, which I mentioned earlier, seeks to provide a consumer perspective on the direction of breast cancer research by promoting the priorities of women. The support for breast cancer research and for the organisations providing support for those suffering from breast cancer and their families that has been demonstrated in this past fortnight by the public, by the media and by all of those involved in turning out for events and just being there for those who are at a time of great need is truly heartening. It signals a very positive future for continuing improvements in lowering the incidence of breast cancer in this country.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.28 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>16862</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>16862</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Air Navigation ActâRegulationsâStat-utory Rules 2003 No. 260.</para><para>Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry ActâAustralian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Sheepmeat and Goatmeat Export to the European UnionâQuota Year 2004) Order 2003.</para><para>Australian Research Council ActâDetermination No. 17âDetermination under section 51, dated 3 September 2003.</para><para>Class Rulings CR 2003/90-CR 2003/94.</para><para>Currency ActâCurrency (Royal Australian Mint) Determination 2003 (No. 6).</para><para>Customs ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 2003 No. 253.</para><para>Family Law ActâFamily Law (Super-annuation) RegulationsâMethods and Factors for Valuing Particular Super-annuation Interests Approval Amendment 2003 (No. 1).</para><para>Fisheries Management ActâSouthern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management Plan 1995â2003 SBT Final TAC Determination.</para><para>Goods and Services Tax Bulletinâ</para><para>GSTB 2000/2 (Addendum).</para><para>GSTB 2003/1 (Addendum).</para><para>Goods and Services Tax Determination GSTD 2003/3.</para><para>Goods and Services Tax Rulingâ</para><para>GSTR 1999/1 (Addendum).</para><para>GSTR 2000/30 (Addendum).</para><para>GSTR 2001/1 (Addendum) and GSTR 2001/8 (Addendum).</para><para>Health Insurance ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 2003 Nos 254-256.</para><para>Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services ActâRegu-lationsâStatutory Rules 2003 No. 263.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</inline>âRegulationsâStatutory Rules 2003 No. 262. </para><para>Medical Indemnity ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 2003 No. 264.</para><para>National Health ActâDetermination underâ</para><para>Schedule 1âPHS 21/2003.</para><para>Section 5DâPHS 20/2003.</para><para>Product Rulingâ</para><para>PR 2002/40 (Notice of Withdrawal).</para><para>PR 2003/60-PR 2003/64.</para><para>Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation ActâApproved forms under section 34Sâ</para><para>Notice 21 of 2003âApproved form for application for initial approval as a rehabilitation program provider.</para><para>Notice 22 of 2003âApproved form for application for renewal of approval as a rehabilitation program provider.</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew ActâRegu-lationsâStatutory Rules 2003 No. 261.</para><para>Taxation Ruling TR 2003/13.</para><para>Telecommunications ActâTelecom-muni-cations (Types of Cabling Work) Amendment Declaration 2003 (No. 1).</para><para>Therapeutic Goods ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 2003 Nos 257-259.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>16864</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: South Coast Packing Operation, Moruya</title><page.no>16864</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1689)</subtitle><id.no>1689</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16864</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 August 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the grant of $32 617 to the South East Packing Operation in Moruya, New South Wales in round five of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program (DRAP):</para><para>(1)	What are the names of the principals of the project proponent, Advocate Support Pty Ltd.</para><para>(2)	On what date did the South East New South Wales Area Consultative Committee first engage in discussions with representatives of Advocate Support Pty Ltd and/or other parties in relation to the project proposal.</para><para>(3)	(a) On what date was the project application endorsed by the committee;

On the âdisruptionâ operation being run from Indonesia. </para><para>We have interviews with two people, one Australian and one Indonesian who were heavily involved in the âdisruptionâ operation against people smuggling run by the Indonesian National Police with AFP involvement. It is onethe basis of these two interviews as well as interviews with the Interpol chief in Indonesia and Immigration officials there that the following questions are based.</para><para>1. As part of the disruption operation were understand that five âSpecial Intelligence Unitâ teams were run by INP to deal with people smuggling in hot spot areas in Indonesia and that these teams received equipment and support from Australia, can the Commissioner confirm this?</para><para>A.	The five teams were PST teams there was only one SIU team. Material presented to Certain Maritime Inquiry adequately addresses this issue in detail. </para><para>2. Part of the efforts of these police was to attempt to track the departure of vessel by gathering information from crews, informants among the asylum seekers, following buses of asylum seekers, collecting information at departure points, is this accurate?</para><para>A.	We do not comment on informants or investigation methodology specifically. However, all investigation avenues of inquiry were pursued. See also Overall comment concerning the allegations made in these questions.</para><para>3. According to two interviews, the disruption operation included Indonesian police sabotaging the boats of people smugglers in Indonesian ports. According to one INP officer, âWe did it very carefully with accurate calculation so that the boat will stop in quite a reachable distance that they could be found by people from nearby islandsâ. The sabotaging of boats included interfering with fuel tanks and engines. What knowledge did Officer Dixon in Indonesia have of this INP operation, were officers in Canberra, including the Commissioner told of these operations or briefed on them in any verbal or written reports?</para><para>A.	None. Never heard of these incidents. Never heard any rumours. No.</para><para>4. According to one Australian source involved in the operation, the INP also made payments to crew members on these vessels to sabotage the vessels at crew change stops on route to Australia like Roti Island and Krakatau, allowing the crews to be paid in part by people smugglers and also by the INP. What did Officer Dixon know of these operations and were officers in Canberra, including the Commissioner told of these operations or briefed on them in any verbal or written form?</para><para>A.	No knowledge. </para><para>Comment: People don't live on Krakatu, there was not PST (INP SIUs) on Roti. Virtually no communications there either, in fact approx May/June 2002 AFP had to provide satellite telephones. There are only 5 x INP officers there. </para><para>5. Was money paid to the informant Kevin Enniss by the APF used to pay crews and/or INP members who participated in sabotage operations against people smuggling vessels?</para><para>A.	No. Not at all.</para><para>6. Were the sabotage operations discussed between AFP, DIMA (as it was then) and/or PM and C?</para><para>A.	No.</para><para>7. We have several accounts of two meetings in 2001 that Officer Dixon participated in with other Australian embassy officers, including defence officers and Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock where the issue of sabotaging people smuggling vessels was raised. Did Officer Dixon raise any concerns either at this meeting with the minister or later to you or any other senior AFP officers about the issue of sabotaging people smuggling vessels? </para><para>A.	FA Dixon was not present at any meetings where the issue of sabotaging people smuggling boats was discussed.</para><para>8. Was the issue of sabotaging people smuggling vessels ever raised with the AFP's responsible minister?</para><para>A.	No.</para><para>B.	The SIEV X </para><para>1. Evidence released to the CMI Senate inquiry indicates an intelligence gathering operation on Abu Quassey had begun at least as far back as August 2001 by the AFP and DIMA. How concerned was the AFP about Abu Quassay's operation, was he a target of the joint AFP/DIMA (now DIMIA) strike force?</para><para>A.	These matters are presently before the court and are subject to sub-judice considerations. </para><para>2. Intelligence from the AFP was passed to Coastwatch on October 17 about the departure of this vessel, what precisely did that report say?</para><para>A.	These matters are presently before the court and are subject to sub-judice considerations. </para><para>3. We have been informed that Officer Dixon, another colleague and Kevin Enniss and INP officers were in West Java at the time of the SIEV X departure, monitoring various smugglers including Abu Quassey and that information on the departure was coming directly from an informant involved in Quassey's operation, is this accurate?</para><para>A.	Mr Enniss was never in West Java. At the time FA Dixon believes he was coming back from West Java looking at the organisers of a different boat, SIEV 6, which sailed to Ashmore Reef.  SIEV X departed Indonesia from across the strait. Mr Enniss worked in Kupang. The AFP/INP SIU were not monitoring Abu Quassey.</para><para>4. We are also informed there was a telephone call from the boat, the SIEV X, to Abu Quassey on the shore shortly after the departure of the vessel on the early morning of the 18th, this call was reported to the AFP and to the naval attache in Jakarta, Al Johnson. Was this included in the AFP intelligence reports to DIMA and Coastwatch, if not, why not?</para><para>A.	The AFP learnt about communications from SIEV X late on the 22nd or early on the 23rd October from survivor reports.</para><para>5. We understand two members of the Mandanean community were working as operates for Abu Quassey in gathering passengers for the SIEV X. Some 24 Mandaneans left the boat near the Krakatau Islands regarding the boat as unseaworthy. According to interviews with some of these people, they then returned to Bandar Lampung, the vessel's departure point late on October 19 and reported to local police there on the SIEV X, and its unseaworthiness. Was this information passed to Officer Dixon and was it included in the report he telephoned to Coastwatch on the morning of the 20th.</para><para>A.	The AFP has no knowledge of who worked with/for Abu Quassey. </para><para>There was no INP SIU team on East Sumatra and it was never a departure point the reports were never made to the AFP. </para><para>6. That call from Dixon was made at 5.30am from Indonesia, what was the urgency of that call? Will the Commissioner brief us on the contents of that call which was then passed to Joint Intelligence headquarters and Norcom according to Col Gallagher's evidence on July 11 to the Senate inquiry?</para><para>A.	FA Dixon did not make this telephone call however, the time of call was normal as by that time it was 9:30am in Canberra. </para><para>7. Was the AFP asked to give any information on the two Abu Quassey operatives from the Mandanean community in support of their refugee applications to a western country?</para><para>A.	No. FA Dixon has never heard of this.  </para><para>8. The AFP says it was not aware that the Abu Quassey vessel had sunk until late on the evening of October 22. Yet interviews with the survivors of SIEV X and the fishing vessel owners clearly indicated the fishermen who picked up survivors contacted their owners near Bandar Lampung immediately on rescuing the survivors on the morning of October 20. The owners in turn contacted the INP on that morning of October 20. Was no information passed from the INP to the AFP in Jakarta for two days about the rescue?</para><para>A.	No. Delays in INP reporting procedures may have contributed to this delay. </para><para>9. Has the AFP any information that anyone, INP or informants or crew sabotaged the SIEV X?</para><para>A.	No. </para><para>C.	On the MOU protcols on people smuggling co-operation being set aside in September 2001. </para><para>1. Was the Commissioner informed in Jakarta that concerns about the transparency of the âdisruptionâ operations, payments made to INP officers and informants by Kevin Enniss, and the sabotage operations played any role in setting aside the protocols for the MOU?</para><para>A.	No. None of those were reasons. The Protocol was suspended because the Indonesian Government wanted a Government-to-Government level agreement. </para><para>2. UNHCR officials have reports from numerous asylum seekers in Indonesian </para><para>claiming that Mr Enniss took their money for passages to Australia on people smuggling boats but they did not get those passages. Was this tactic a sanctioned part of the âdisruptionâ operation? Were these moneys used to pay informants and operatives by Mr Enniss? </para><para>A.	Asylum seekers paid money to Mr Enniss who gave the money to the INP. The AFP managed Mr Enniss, the INP controlled him. This is the same as an informant taking money from prospective drug purchasers and giving that money to the police. The drugs are naturally never supplied to the prospective drug purchasers. </para><para>Overall comment concerning the allegations made in these questions:</para><para>The use of large fishing vessels in the Indonesian waters has ruined the local fishing industry leaving many smaller fishing boats and crews idle. FA Dixon stated that the AFP and INP SIUs only followed the passengers because there are hundreds of boats for sale and the crews frequently go with them.   The organisers themselves may not know what boats they are going to buy until shortly before travelling, so it would be impossible to identify a boat in time, if some of the alleged activities were to be attempted. At times the people smugglers would not identify and purchase a boat until the evening before an intended journey.

</para><para>(4)	I am not aware of the source of reports that have made various claims about the cost of providing security for the visit. Police in the jurisdictions to be visited by HRH Prince Harry have principal responsibility for security measures and the cost will primarily fall to the jurisdictions. The costs of the accompanying Royal Protection Officers are the responsibility of the UK Government. Because the Prince will be visiting a number of jurisdictions, the Australian Federal Police is supporting the States with the provision of liaison officers. This will incur a cost to the Australian Federal Police.</para><para>(5)	The Australian Government has a range of international obligations to ensure effective protection arrangements are in place for visiting dignitaries. The level of security afforded to individual visiting dignitaries will depend on an assessment of the level of risk to the visitor. The publicity given to the visit and prominence of the visit in the public eye is a factor in assessing the risk to HRH Prince Harry. Security arrangements for the visit to Australia by Prince Harry have been made on the basis of a comprehensive risk assessment. Security measures to be applied were decided upon after careful consideration and wide consultation with appropriate Australian and State government agencies, and are in line with our international obligations.   </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nuclear Energy: Waste Storage</title><page.no>16895</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2134)</subtitle><id.no>2134</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16895</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 18 September 2003:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to work by the department on the proposed nuclear waste dump in South Australia: </para><para>(1)	Did departmental officers develop a list of `experts' that were used to make public comments in support of the proposed nuclear waste dump; if so, when was this list first developed.</para><para>(2)	What was the proposed nature of the relationship with the `experts'. </para><para>(3)	Were members of the media and/or `media commentators' proposed to be included as part of the expert panel; if so, why.</para><para>(4)	What tasks were each of the `experts' required to perform.</para><para>(5)	Were formal contracts entered in to with each of the `experts'.</para><para>(6)	Were any payments made to any of the `experts'; if so: (a) to whom; (b) what amount; (c) what were the payments for; and (d) when were the payments made.</para><para>(7)	Was it a requirement that these `experts', including members of the media and/or `media commentators', be required to disclose these payments when making any public comments.</para><para>(8)	Did departmental officers consider the need to undertake media training of the `experts' selected to support the proposed nuclear waste dump.</para><para>(9)	How was the expert panel formed.</para><para>(10)	Were any of the `experts' provided with media training by consultants to the department; if so: (a) who received training; and (b) what was the cost. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>16896</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	No.</para><para>(2)	Not applicable.</para><para>(3)	Not applicable.</para><para>(4)	Not applicable.</para><para>(5)	Not applicable.</para><para>(6)	Not applicable.</para><para>a.
